A firm understanding of biology is necessary to engage in medical science, medical research and, to a lesser but still significant extent, to practice clinical medicine. Evolution is recognized as a fundamental organizing principle of modern biology, as illustrated in the epigraphs of this commentary. Over the past century, the field of evolutionary biology became an established and productive perspective in the biological science community, and yet it can be argued that evolution is the area of biology that is the least well-integrated into medical education [3, 4] . Medical education currently focuses on proximate explanations of biological principles and mechanisms important to human health and disease and does not always include ultimate or evolutionary explanations [5] . Proximate explanations are vital to understanding medical conditions and treating and preventing diseases, but they are insufficient in answering the 'why' questions posed both by medical students and researchers. An evolutionary perspective enables a deeper understanding of biological phenomena and can even predict them. For example, microbial antibiotic resistance and its frightening spread are understandable and predictable from an evolutionary perspective. Accordingly, our medical and public health efforts to slow the increase in antibiotic resistant pathogens would be enhanced by taking evolution into account [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 11, "end": 27, "text": "Dobzhansky, 1973", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 28, "end": 31, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 650, "end": 653, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 654, "end": 656, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1496, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "We argue that an evolutionary perspective is particularly relevant to the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Reproduction is under strong selective pressure, and women's reproductive efforts (gestation and lactation) are more complex, resource intensive and prone to complications that can affect health and wellbeing compared to those of men. For example, after implantation of the human blastocyst, the placental villi invade the maternal endometrium. Abnormal placentation is associated with potentially life-threatening (for mother and/or fetus) pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, hemorrhage and preterm birth [7] . In a normal pregnancy, the invasion of the decidua by placental villi only intrudes into the decidual basalis, but in a small proportion of pregnancies (0.2-0.4%; [8] ) the villi invade the myometrium (placenta accrete, increta or percreta, depending on the extent of the invasion of the myometrium). This can lead to life-threatening hemorrhaging after birth [8] . Preeclampsia, which affects 4% of US pregnancies [9] and is the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide [9] , is also a disease of abnormal placentation. In preeclampsia, a deficiency in the villi invasion and remodeling of the uterine spiral arteries results in inadequate placentation and a maternal inflammatory response [7] . Preeclampsia has been suggested to have an evolutionary origin in parent-offspring conflict [10, 11] . In brief, the highly invasive hemochorial human placenta allows the fetus to release hormones and other biologically active molecules into maternal circulation that affect maternal metabolism and physiology. From the evolutionary 'perspective' of the fetus, receiving maximal resources from the mother is beneficial even if it compromises her ability for future reproduction. In contrast, the reproductive fitness of the mother is enhanced if she only provides sufficient resources to her fetus while minimally affecting her future reproductive potential. Hence, an evolutionary conflict between mother and fetus [10] . Studies have shown that many of the genes associated with preeclampsia are under positive selective pressure [7] and that some of these genes are associated with placentation in species with a less invasive placenta type than human placenta [11, 12] . These studies provide supporting evidence for the proposed parent-offspring conflict model underlying preeclampsia [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 632, "end": 635, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1001, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1056, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1124, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1344, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1447, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2067, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2182, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2315, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2319, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2441, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Another important concept is that evolution results in adaptive solutions to past challenges and does not predict future circumstances.

Proponents could be accused of requiring one more piece of science to be stuffed into the minds of young physicians by medical educators who are not fully qualified to teach the subject. However, including the evolutionary perspective in medical education arms physicians with an understanding of the ultimate (evolutionary) answers to clinical questions, rather than simply proximate (basic mechanistic) explanations, providing physicians with a more complete understanding of the etiology of health and disease [1, 4, 17, 18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 325, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 944, "end": 947, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 948, "end": 950, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 951, "end": 954, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 955, "end": 958, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "There is support for the value of training in evolution for practicing obstetrician-gynecologists.

Of these 600 individuals, 229 returned surveys. Most respondents (64.4%) believed that it is either 'important' or 'vital' for medical students to have a basic understanding of evolutionary biology, and only 10% reported believing that it is not important. Responses were varied when determining how evolution education should be incorporated into medical school curriculum, but a majority does support incorporation in some fashion (Table 1 ).

There are many public health issues with strong links to evolution.

The rapid rise and broad extent of current antibiotic resistance is due to several factors, one intrinsic to bacteria (horizontal gene transfer) but the others are human factors. Horizontal gene transfer, the transfer of genetic material between different microbial taxa, greatly enhances the ability of resistance genes to spread. But, the primary culprit for the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance is the overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics by people, especially the wide-spread use of antibiotics in the food animal business [22] . However, the advent of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is predicted to occur by evolutionary theory, even if antibiotics are used in judicious and appropriate ways. For example, the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea used to be easily and quickly cured by penicillin. Now the only effective treatment is a two-drug cocktail of third-generation antibiotics [23] , and there are worrying signs of resistance to these may be developing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Evolution, Public Health and the One Health Concept"}, {"text": "Regarding environmental public health, many modern disease risks are linked to a mismatch between the environment we evolved under and the one we have created, through both direct and indirect effects on human health. Air pollution is associated with increased risks of respiratory tract infections and cardiovascular disease [24, 25] and has also been shown to be associated with preterm birth and early miscarriage [26, 27] . The One Health concept integrates the essential connections between human health and disease and both animal and environmental health [28] . The combination of the degradation of the environment, spreading pandemics associated with increased human and domestic animal contact with wild animals (e.g. COVID- 19) , and climate change altering, and in many cases, expanding the geographic ranges of disease vectors, has led global public health to adopt the One Health concept. One Health is intrinsically evolutionary in its theory and practice. A healthy vaginal microbiome confers many advantages, most of which are not fully understood. The study of the vaginal microbiome should inform and guide practice in areas such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other infections of the lower reproductive tract. BV, a common problem among women of childbearing age with a US prevalence ranging from 6.1% to 51.4% in high-risk populations [29] , is at its core a disease of microbiome dysbiosis. The normal vaginal microbial community has been disrupted leading to overgrowth of pathogenic or at least noncommensal microorganisms [30] , which can increase the risks for health issues such as a woman's vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and during pregnancy, premature birth and fetal loss [31] . Often used characteristics to screen for BV are a vaginal pH > 4.5 [32] and a low prevalence of Lactobacillus species among the vaginal microbiota [33] . However, these characteristics exist in asymptomatic healthy women, especially among women of African descent and of Hispanic origin [34] . Interestingly, the vaginal communities of asymptomatic women that contained few, if any, Lactobacillus species had other lactic acid-producing species, suggesting that the production of lactic acid may be the important functional role of the human vaginal microbiome [35, 36] . The human vaginal microbiome appears to be unique in being dominated by Lactobacillus or other lactic acid-producing species, as these are not found in the vaginal microbiomes of nonhuman primates including our closest relative, the chimpanzee [37] .

We advocate that medical schools should require evolution coursework before enrolling to ensure medical students have at least a working knowledge of evolutionary principles [64] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1672, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Perception of the utility of evolution in medicine"}, {"text": "Overall, physicians who completed our survey believe that knowledge of evolutionary medicine is important for students of their profession to know, but not important enough to change the status quo of current medical education programs.

Eighty percent thought residency programs should incorporate evolutionary medicine, but only 34.1% thought it should be required. However, medical students may be more receptive to evolutionary medicine curriculum than respondents of our study; a study found that after completing an evolutionary medicine course, all students recommended the course for other students and rated the value of learning evolutionary medicine 4.7 out of 5 on a scale [65] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 827, "end": 831, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Perception of the utility of evolution in medicine"}, {"text": "Our findings also highlight the importance of acknowledging political and religious biases when discussing evolutionary medicine. Politically conservative and more religious respondents had lower responses for the overall importance of evolution but rated their level of knowledge of evolutionary medicine no differently than respondents of other political and religious groups. This trend was more prominent if religion was reported to be important in providers' clinical practice (F \u00bc 7.414, P \u00bc 0.001). On average, providers rated the importance of evolution in medicine as higher if they identified as having liberal political views (F \u00bc 12.821, P < 0.001).

Placing a greater emphasis on evolution education at the undergraduate level as a condition of acceptance into medical school is a possible solution. However, we advocate offering courses on evolution at all levels of training. There are published materials that serve as resources for incorporating the evolutionary perspective into medical training, ranging from traditional textbooks [62, 71] to edited volumes presenting a variety of perspectives [72] [73] [74] . The growing awareness of the importance of the evolutionary perspective to understanding human health requires medical educators to confront the issue and to become creative in updating medical training to heighten knowledge of evolution.
