Compared with the EU states farther from Italy, the state-wide lockdown dates were more likely linked to turning points of human mobilities in the EU states closer to Italy, which were also more likely linked to second turning points of COVID-19 epidemics. Among the examined human mobilities, the second turning points in driving mobility and the first turning points in parks mobility were the best factors that connected lockdown dates and COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states closer to Italy. Our findings highlight the state-and mobility-heterogeneity in the associations of public health interventions and human mobility with changes of COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states.",

We used piecewise log-linear or ordinal least square regression models to identify the turning points of the daily new cases or human mobility. Two turning points (i.e. 3 segments) were assumed in each modelling. The locally weighted scatter smoothing (LOWESS) algorithm was used to smooth daily incidence and mobility trajectories. 9, 10 It is noteworthy that the daily incidence and its changes are proportional to those of daily new cases since the population of a given state remained relatively constant during the study period. Pearson's correlation and ordinal least square analyses were conducted to assess the potential link to turning points. All p values were 2-sided. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Nearly all of the EU states had 3 segments of trends in COVID-19 incidence (Supplementary Table 1 ). The piecewise log-linear models show that the COVID-19 daily growth rate in the first segment of Italy was 7.8%, and statistically indifferent from those in the second segments of all other state groups (STable 2), suggesting a delayed growth in non-Italy EU states. Interestingly, only the states in group 1 had a much faster decreasing rate than Italy (Supplementary Table 2 ). Among the 27 states, 21 implemented a state-wide lockdown policy, and 25 implemented social distance restrictions. The daily new cases overall had a median increase rate of 8.8% per day (interquartile 5.7-10.5%), which peaked at 67 per million (interquartile 27-118), and then decreased at a median rate of 1.9% (interquartile 3.0-0.0%).

Thus, the neighboring relationship to the COVID-19 epicenter may determine or influence the associations of the lockdown dates with turning points in human mobility in EU states, and subsequently those with COVID-19 epidemics. In other words, there was considerable state heterogeneity in the COVID-19 epidemics of EU states, which seemed linked to human mobility and indirectly to the lockdown dates. Therefore, these associations may not be significant in all states combined due to the \"dilution\" from the non-group 1 states. Indeed, a previous report using susceptible-infected-recovered and machine learning (gradient-boosted trees) models showed that changes of social distancing explained 46% of the variances in COVID-19 transmission rate. 11 Despite the difference in study design and time-frame of interest, the state heterogeneity shown by this study may in part explain their findings. Furthermore, the state heterogeneity should be considered when implementing public health interventions. Perhaps the states closer to the epicenter state should have considered implementing public health interventions earlier and stricter than other states in the affected continent. However, when and how the states farther away from the epicenter should implement these interventions are not clear and warrant further evaluation.",

Most of the previous studies on human mobility and COVID-19 used migration mobility data. 2, 12, 13 One study described the temporal trends of mobile device-based mobility (Safegraph) in 4 U.S. metropolitan cities, but did not model any turning points of mobility trends. 14 Indeed, GPS-based individual mobility data were provided by Google and Apple only after April 2020. 4,5 The Google and Apple mobility data were based on observations at locations (e.g. residential and work places) and moving modes (i.e. walking, driving and transit), respectively. Such a difference may partially explain why the best interlink factors between lockdown dates and COVID-19 daily incidence were the second turning points in driving mobility (Apple), but the first turning points in parks mobility (Google) . The reason for this may be that statewide lockdown was associated with the bottom in the trends of individual-based driving mobility (Apple data), and with the first turning points in the trends of locationbased parks mobility (Google data), while both turning points were linked to the changes in daily incidence. Therefore, policy makers may consider using the first turning point of parks mobility and the bottom/second turning point of driving mobility to monitor the effects of state-wide lockdowns and predict the peak points of COVID-19 daily incidence. A possible cutoff of the lowest driving mobility would be approximately 25% of the baseline mobility, which was the one observed in this study.",

First, this study was focused on the state heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemics and their associated factors in EU where less strict public health interventions were implemented for COVID-19 than those in China. We show that the EU states closer to the epicenter (Italy in the EU) were more likely to observe the links between lockdown and human mobility changes, and subsequently the changes in COVID-19 epidemic. Second, we comprehensively analyzed the associations of the GPSbased mobilities with COVID-19 epidemics in the EU states, including location-based Google and individual activity-based Apple mobility data. The previous reports on COVID-19 have used Google and Apple mobilities, 11 or human migration mobility in Europe, the USA or China. 2, 14, 15 However, to our knowledge they have not examined the association of turning points of these mobilities with the changes in both public health intervention and COVID-19 epidemics. Third, this study provides early evidence on whether and how human mobilities were associated with COVID-19 epidemics under less strict state-wide lockdown. Similarly, the association of human migration mobility with COVID-19 differed by the distance to its epicenter (Wuhan at the time) in China, 2 where the public health interventions were much stricter than the rest of the world and may not be applicable to other states.",

Moreover, the state heterogeneity among the EU states may not be generalizable to other continents because of the unique cultures and geopolitical systems in the EU. China, for example, implemented very strict public health interventions and may not experience significant providence-heterogeneity in the associations of public health interventions with COVID-19 epidemics. Furthermore, the mobility data of Cyprus were not available, and could not be reliably analyzed. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 tests used in each state might differ, and lead to some variances in the (daily) incidence of COVID-19. However, all clinical tests on the EU markets must have gone through regulatory reviews by the European Medicine Agency, and should have considerably similar sensitivity and specificity. The singlemarket policy in the EU also reduced differences in the tests' availability among all EU states. 16 The variances in COVID-19 test performance thus were minimal in the EU states.",
