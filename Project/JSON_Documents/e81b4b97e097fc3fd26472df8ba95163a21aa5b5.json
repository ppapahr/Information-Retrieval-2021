Clinical research has shown that patients treated with sunitinib develop hypertension. As soon as sunitinib-induced hypertension appears, it is usual to administer anti-hypertension agent. But this treatment may cause acute blood pressure fluctuation which may lead to additional cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for managing sunitinib-induced hypertension and blood pressure fluctuation. A mechanism-based PK/PD model was developed based on animal experiments. Then this model was used to perform simulations, thus to propose an anti-hypertension indication, according to which the antihypertension treatment might yield relative low-level AUC and fluctuation of blood pressure. The simulation results suggest that the anti-hypertension agent may yield low-level AUC and fluctuation of blood pressure when relative ET-1 level ranges from \u221215% to 5% and relative NO level is more than 10% compared to control group. Finally, animal experiments were conducted to verify the simulation results. Macitentan (30 mg/kg) was administered based on the above anti-hypertension indication. Compared with the untreated group, the optimized treatment significantly reduced the AUC of blood pressure; meanwhile the fluctuation of blood pressure in optimized treatment group was 70% less than that in immediate treatment group. This work provides a novel model with potential translational value for managing sunitinib-induced hypertension.",

Previous clinical research has shown that patients treated with sunitinib develop hypertension [2] . Hypertension induced by sunitinib is associated with serious cardiovascular complications, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure, and the use of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition may be compromised in cancer patients who develop hypertension [3, 4] . Improving the management of hypertension caused by sunitinib may be helpful in preventing severe cardiotoxicity. However, randomized controlled trials on the treatment of angiogenesis inhibition-induced hypertension are not available, and no clear recommendation for a particular antihypertensive agent or class agents can be given [5] . The clinical use of sunitinib may be compromised without a suitable antihypertension strategy. To address this challenge, preclinical studies on suitable antihypertensive strategies should be performed.",

            "text": "Previous preclinical studies have investigated the use of antihypertensive therapy for hypertension induced by sunitinib [3, [6] [7] [8] . These studies identified treatments for inhibiting hypertension induced by sunitinib, but the fluctuation of blood pressure during antihypertensive treatment was ignored in these studies. In the previous studies, sunitinib and antihypertensive agents were administered simultaneously, which may have yielded dramatic fluctuations in blood pressure; e.g., the antihypertensive treatment proposed by Witte et al. doubled blood pressure fluctuation levels compared to that in subjects that did not receive antihypertensive treatment. The treatment protocol reported by Lankhorst et al. resulted in a similar fluctuation, but such a fluctuation was not observed in subjects that did not receive antihypertensive treatment [3, 8] . Previous studies have revealed that blood pressure variability increases cardiac, vascular, and renal damage [9, 10] . Therefore, the high blood pressure variability induced by antihypertensive treatment may limit the benefits provided by lowering blood pressure. The aim of this study was to develop a mechanismbased pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for proposing an optimized antihypertensive management method that can lower both blood pressure and its fluctuation in rats.",

            "text": "In this study, a mechanism-based PK-PD model was developed to optimize antihypertensive treatment. It is crucial to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertension induced by sunitinib to develop such a model. Sunitinib acts by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor type 1 (CSF-1 R), and the glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET) [11] . Among these targets of sunitinib, the VEGF pathway is frequently associated with the development of severe hypertension [5] . Sunitinib can decrease NO production by inhibiting the VEGF pathway, which plays a key role in blood pressure regulation [5] . Moreover, previous studies have reported that sunitinib can elevate the plasma level of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the most potent vasoconstrictor identified thus far [5, 7, 12] . In summary, the mechanism of hypertension induced by sunitinib mainly involves two pathways. First, sunitinib inhibits vasodilation by decreasing NO production. Second, sunitinib induces vasoconstriction by elevating ET-1 levels.",

Second, a mechanism-based PK-PD that can provide insight into the relationship between the plasma concentration of sunitinib and blood pressure was developed. Third, simulations based on the PK-PD model and progression analysis were performed according to the proposed hypothesis that the effect of antihypertensive treatment on blood pressure and its fluctuation are affected by variations in NO-ET homeostasis. The simulations demonstrated the different effects of antihypertensive treatment on blood pressure and its fluctuation under different states of NO-ET homeostasis. Fourth, animal experiments were performed to verify the antihypertensive treatment proposed by the PK-PD model.

The dosage of sunitinib was based on previous experimental studies that investigated hypertension induced by sunitinib [3, 7, 13, 14] . The protocol for systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement was designed based on the method described by Whitesall et al. and Kubota et al. [15, 16] . All rats were acclimated to restraint, tailcuff inflation and heating the day before the start of the experiment. The rats were placed in plastic restrainers with heating pads set to 33~34\u00b0C. The instrument (ALC-NIBP, ALCBIO; Shanghai, China) automatically took ten 30-s measurements. SBP values were recorded when more than five consecutive stable readings were available. The highest and lowest readings were discarded, and the remaining readings were averaged to obtain one data point. SBP was measured daily. Blood samples were collected in tubes containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) daily. Samples were collected at the same time on each sampling day. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 4000 \u00d7 g and 4\u00b0C for 10 min. The prepared plasma samples were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until analysis.",

To avoid bias based on background variation in the simulation, the percentage change in the ARV compared to that of the control group (\u0394ARV, Eq. 10) was used in the simulation. The simulation was performed based on three scenarios. The aim of scenario I was to choose a suitable antihypertensive agent.

Then, the AUC of blood pressure and \u0394ARV yielded by amlodipine and macitentan treatment were compared to find a suitable antihypertensive agent. The dose of amlodipine was set to 1 mg/kg (equivalent to the maximum tolerated dose in humans), and the dose of macitentan was set to 30 mg/kg (equivalent to a high but well tolerated dose in humans) [27, 28] . The aim of scenario II was to find the appropriate dose of the selected antihypertensive agent. For this purpose, different doses of selected antihypertensive agents were administered. Then, the AUC of blood pressure and \u0394ARV were calculated. The aim of scenario III was to investigate the indication for antihypertensive treatment.

PK-PD parameters of amlodipine and macitentan for simulation. experiment, rats were randomly administered sunitinib (26.7 mg/kg; once daily; n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) by oral gavage for 10 days. The estimated PK-PD model parameters are listed in Table 2 . Random effects for parameters E ET , k 1 , k 2 , and k SBP out were induced. The bootstrapping values of these parameters remained near the final parameter estimation with a relatively low coefficient of variance (CV). Goodness-of-fit plots of the final model are shown in Fig. 3a -c and suggest that the errors of both population and individual profiles were acceptable. The visual predictive check (VPC) for the PK-PD model is shown in Fig. 3c . The VPC plots show that the observed average data fell within the 95% prediction confidence interval. Moreover, a low-dose experiment was performed as an external verification of the PK-PD model. In this experiment, rats were randomly administered sunitinib (10 mg/kg; once daily; n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) by oral gavage for 10 days. The experiment was used to simulate changes in NO, ET, and SBP to verify the PK-PD model, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental data. The results are shown in Fig. 4a, b . The results suggest that the error was acceptable and that the PK-PD model fit the low-dose experiment data. Furthermore, as sunitinib may induce renal damage, which may affect SBP and bias the PK-PD model, creatinine levels in the low-dose group, high-dose group and control group were measured to determine whether the model was biased by renal damage. The results are shown in Fig. 4c . The results show that creatinine levels were not significantly different among these three groups at any of the time points (P > 0.05, based on one-way ANOVA), suggesting that no significant renal damage occurred during the experiment. Therefore, the goodness of fit of the PK-PD model was satisfactory, and the model was not biased by the renal damage induced by sunitinib.",

The simulation suggested that the blood pressure fluctuation decreased until the dose of macitentan increased to 40 mg/kg and that if the dose of macitentan exceeded 40 mg/kg, blood pressure fluctuation increased. The AUC of blood pressure decreased as the dose of macitentan increased. Thus, 40 mg/kg macitentan should be selected for hypertension treatment.

            "text": "Previous studies have proposed that the mechanism of hypertension-induced sunitinib involves variations in NO-ET homeostasis. The NO system works in balance with the ET system, but sunitinib may decease NO, which makes NO unable to balance the vasoconstrictor ET [29] [30] [31] . Our study suggested that the balance between NO and ET may also affect the response of hypertension induced by sunitinib to antihypertensive agents. According to our experiment, from day 0 to day 3 after sunitinib administration, NO-ET homeostasis is in the compensatory unbalanced state. Previous research has shown that sunitinib may decrease NO, but our study showed that NO increased from day 0 to day 2 and then decreased [5] . The increase in ET-1 may stimulate NO release to balance the vasoconstrictive effect of ET-1 [23] . These results suggest that the system may still maintain NO-ET homeostasis in the compensatory unbalanced state. Subjects in this state may be highly sensitive to antihypertensive treatment. Our experiments and previous reports suggest that in the compensatory unbalanced state, antihypertensive treatment may lower blood pressure AUC (AUC Treated /AUC Untreated \u2264 70%) and may cause acute blood pressure fluctuation (\u0394ARV Treated > \u0394ARV Untreated ) [3, [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, it is not recommended to administer any antihypertensive treatment in the compensatory unbalanced state because of the potential cardiovascular risk caused by blood pressure fluctuations. NO-ET homeostasis may enter the weak balance state on day 4. In this state, the elevated sunitinib plasma concentration may enhance the inhibition of NO release, which may cause NO to decrease and limit the ability of NO-ET homeostasis to maintain blood pressure. Subjects in the weak balance state may be moderately sensitive to antihypertensive treatment. Our simulations and experiments suggested that in this state, antihypertensive treatment can significantly lower AUC and blood pressure fluctuations (P < 0.01). Therefore, it is recommended to administer antihypertensive treatment in a weak balance state to reduce potential cardiovascular risk. From day 5 to day 9 after sunitinib administration, NO-ET homeostasis is in the pathological balance state. Compared with that in the weak balance state, sensitivity to antihypertensive agents decreases in this state. Our simulations showed that the effect of antihypertensive treatment in lowering blood pressure AUC may be limited but that it is still helpful in managing blood pressure fluctuations. In the pathological unbalanced state, SBP and ET-1 were markedly increased and NO decreased continuously. In this state, hypertension may be related to multiple other mechanisms because both the simulations and the previous research showed that the effect of the ET receptor antagonist macitentan is limited, which suggests that NO-ET homeostasis disorder may not be the sole causative factor of hypertension [3] . Apart from NO-ET homeostasis dysfunction, previous studies have proposed other hypotheses suggesting that decreased VEGF function leads to remodeling of capillary beds and endothelial dysfunction [31, 32] . As the mechanisms related to hypertension may be very complex, they remain to be further investigated. The potential translational value of the proposed model, after it is improved and validated by clinical data in the future, lies in providing a new method for optimizing the management of the hypertension induced by sunitinib.",
