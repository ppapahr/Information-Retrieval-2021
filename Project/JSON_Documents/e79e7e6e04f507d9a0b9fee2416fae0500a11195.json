Mean age 20.4 \u00b1 4 years, 75% (291) were females and 58% (226) received their treatment at a public clinic. 27.3% (106) of all participants were still unable to attend to their appointments and 69% (244) stated that closing of the clinic was the main reason for missing their appointments. Depending on their type of appliance the patients faced different problems and chose multiple ways to deal with them. The majority of participants had Fixed Appliances 84% (327) and only 21% (64) of them stated that they had no problem compared to 39% (11) and 36% (8) for Removable Appliances and Clear aligners groups respectively. Conclusion: The COVID19 pandemic has significant impact on orthodontic treatments. Almost each orthodontic patient had to stop attending to their appointment which put them in complicated situations and in fear of delayed treatment. Patients from a public clinic and patients with fixed appliances reported more problems than others. More attention should be giving to teleorthodontics, also orthodontists should prepare their patients to deal with some of the problems related to their appliances when possible.",

Different policies and strategies were taken by each affected country to face this pandemic and minimize the number of cases, from partial to complete lockdown, giving that in the absence of vaccine WHO has recommended some precautions to control infection such as regular hand hygiene, the use of face masks, following cough etiquette and most importantly keeping social distancing [3] . The main way of transmission is through close contact with infected individual. However, numbers of asymptomatic carriers were reported which increases the possibility of transmission without cautious actions being taken [4] . Although most governments encouraged people to stay and work from home, society is in need for healthcare workers in everyday life and during this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pandemic specifically and this put them in high risk. In particular of all healthcare aspects dental producers require more direct contact with aerosols which resemble even higher possibility of infection [5] . Despite numerous modifications and guidelines that were recommended to dental practice during this pandemic, several dental clinics were closed and only patients with emergency cases could visit their dentist under strict precautions and it was suggested that all other regular treatments should be postponed [6, 7] .",

            "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the main concern among society since many limitations have occurred to the everyday life. Being in high risk of infection, most dental clinics were closed which put the patients who were receiving orthodontic treatment in complicated situation since they require regular visits to their orthodontist for a long period of time. This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by patients receiving orthodontic treatment and their proffered solutions to overcoming these challenges during this pandemic in order to avoid such problems in the future. Over the period of 3 weeks, the link of the questionnaire was sent to patients via WhatsApp Messenger since it is used by most of them which made it easier to reach them during quarantine.",

Most problems were reported by patients receiving their treatment at a public clinic and by patients with fixed appliances. More attention should be giving to teleorthodontics specially during this period and for the foreseeable future, also orthodontists should prepare their patients to deal with problems linked to their appliances when possible. The risks and benefits should be compared when deciding to reopen clinics to provide care for orthodontic patients during this outbreak.
