Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines, the available tools against COVID-19 are preventive, such as the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, lockdowns, and mass testing. Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities' efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies. The Weibull distribution was used to model the forecast prediction of COVID-19, in four scenarios, based on the curve of daily new deaths as a function of time. The date in which the number of daily new deaths will fall below the rate of 3 deaths per millionthe average level in which some countries start to relax the stay-at-home measureswas estimated. If the daily new deaths curve was bending today (i.e., about 1250 deaths per day), the predicted date would be on July 5. Forecast predictions allowed the estimation of overall death toll at the end of the outbreak. Our results suggest that each additional day that lasts to bend the daily new deaths curve may correspond to additional 1685 deaths at the end of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil (R 2 = 0.9890). Predictions of the outbreak can be used to guide Brazilian health authorities in the decision-making to properly fight COVID-19 pandemic.",

The impacts of COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are of great concern [1, 2] , since these countries present a large percentage of the population living in overcrowded conditions, with deficient access to clean water and sanitizers, among other factors that limit people living in LMICs to follow the public health advices on how to reduce the spread of the virus [3] . Although Brazil has the World ninth larger gross domestic product [4] , 42% of the Brazilian population live with less than 10 USD per day and more than ten million Brazilians live in extreme poverty [5] . As in other countries, poverty and social inequality are being aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Brazil occupies now the second place in number of registered COVID-19 cases [6] . Forecast predictions made by the Imperial College (London, UK) present Brazil as the country with the highest rate of transmission and one of the countries where a large number of deaths are expected from, on next weeks [7] . The health crisis is sharpened by a political crisis, depicted by two changes of the Health Minister in less than 1 month [8] , and by Federal government authorities constantly denying the severity of COVID-19 pandemic and the scientific consensus on the lockdown and social distancing measures [9] .",

In this work, we have used the Weibull distribution on the number of daily new cases and deaths data of COVID-19 to predict the evolution of the pandemic [12] . The Weibull distribution is one of the most commonly used parametric lifetime models [14] , mostly for its parsimony, its ability to satisfactorily model data which are commonly encountered in survival analysis, and its availability in statistical software packages [15, 16] . A parameter called Diagnostic-Death lag (DDlag), given by the temporal distance, in days, between the peak of daily new cases and the peak of daily new deaths, which strongly correlates with the lethality rate (LR) of COVID-19, was calculated for Brazil's official data. DDlag represents the average time between the diagnostic of new infections and patient deaths due to the diagnosed disease. Intuitively, one could suppose that the more efficient are the detection and the health care delivered to patients, the larger DDlag would be. DDlag can be used to predict COVID-19 evolution and to evaluate its LR, as well as to infer the level of underreported cases of COVID-19 [12] . We took in account four distinct scenarios based in the daily number of new deaths, considering the maximum of 1250, 1500, 1750, and 2000 daily new deaths at the maximum turning point of the curve. Because our predictions are based in the number of daily new deaths, it can be daily reviewed aiming to evaluate the measures further taken to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, such as lockdowns and mass testing and, also, when these measures should be reformulated.",

This behavior of the LR is similar to those observed for most countries, in which the LR raises up to the peak of the epidemic and then maintain stable or with a slight decrease (data not shown). Figure 1 shows that percent LR for COVID-19 in Brazil reached 4.68 \u00b1 0.01%. This value was used to estimate the maximum number of daily new cases at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic curve from the number of daily new deaths chosen for each scenario by applying Eq. 4 (see \"Material and methods\").",

However, taking into account four distinct scenarios based on the maximum turning point of the Weibull prediction curve of daily new deaths for COVID-19 in Brazil, it was possible to draw non-linear regression curves depicting the forecast predictions on the number of daily new deaths in every day, until the end of the epidemic. Figure 2 shows the plots of the number of daily new deaths and cases as a function of time, in days. Values of the number of daily new cases at the maximum turning points for each scenario were calculated with Eq. 4 from the LR observed in Fig. 1 (0.468) . Thus, panels a to d show scatter plots based on data for daily new cases and deaths, and line plots based on the results of the Weibull predictions of these data for each scenario, being the scenario a the most optimistic and the scenario d the most pessimistic. Numbers of daily new deaths and daily new cases at the maximum turning points, calculated with Eq. 4 for each scenario, are as follows: panel a, 1250 daily deaths and 26,709 daily cases; panel b, 1500 daily deaths and 32,051 daily cases; panel c, 1750 daily deaths and 37,393 daily cases; and panel d, 2000 daily deaths and 42,735 daily cases (parameter \u03b1 at Eq. 1).",

Table 1 summarizes the main results estimated from Fig. 2 . As shown, DDlag for COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil varies from 7.3 to 17.5 days from the most optimistic scenario (a) to the most pessimistic scenario (d), respectively. Additionally, the overall death toll of COVID-19 in the most optimistic scenario (a) is 78,347 deaths, though it increases successively up to 176,757 deaths in the most pessimistic scenario (d). Yet, it was possible to estimate, from fit curves in Fig. 2 , the date in which the number of daily new deaths would decrease to less than 3 new daily deaths and/or 20 new daily cases per million habitant (i.e., less than 628 and 4190 deaths and cases per day, respectively, for the population of Brazil). These values were arbitrary taken as examples from other countries that started to relax the lockdown measures when they presented, in average, about 3 new deaths and 20 new cases per million habitants per day (see \"Material and methods\"). As displayed in Table 1 , the forecast predictions presented here estimate that Brazil would present less than 3 deaths per million habitants per day, in the most optimistic scenario (a), on July 5. However, if the curve for daily number of new deaths is not going to bend soon, i.e., if the country would present an increase in the number of new daily deaths in the next days, that date might be shifted up to August 29 in the most pessimistic scenario (d). At last, predictions for the date in which Brazil may present less than 20 cases per million habitants per day are presented in Table 1 . These predictions are quite distinct from those estimated by the number of daily new deaths. We believe that it is due to the decrease of the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil observed since May 22 (Fig. 1) , what will be further discussed below.",

Data analysis can be of outstanding importance during disease outbreaks, mainly if fast decision-making is crucial to slow down the spread of the disease. The prediction of the course of COVID-19 pandemic in highly affected countries is considered a live-saving demand [28, 29] . Our results show that the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil rose since the beginning of pandemic and reached 0.070 (or 7.0%) on May 22. After that, the LR starts to decrease until it reaches 0.0468 (or 4.68%) on June 21. This decrease was due to a rapid growth in the number of daily new cases, mainly after June 1. In almost every country, the LR of COVID-19 tends to remain constant toward the epidemic peak (data not shown). Thus, this decrease of LR observed in Brazil could be indicative that an increase of daily new deaths might be observed in the next days, following the rapid increase of the number of daily new registered cases.",

Those countries are already experiencing the descendent phase of the curve for daily new cases and daily new deaths. DDlag has been shown to be an efficient, empiric parameter to evaluate the overall results of several factors that may affect the spread of COVID-19. As DDlag displayed a strong correlation with the LR, it can be used as a tool to evaluate the level of sub-notification, as well as the efficacy of measures taken in response to the epidemic [12] . This correlation is represented by Eq. 3 and can be used to estimate DDlag from LR and vice versa. Actually (June 21), the LR of COVID-19 in Brazil is 0.0468 (Fig. 1) . This LR value would correspond, second Eq. 3, to a DDlag of 14.1 days. This value of DDlag is compatible with, in average, those ones calculated for scenarios c (1750 deaths per day) and d (2000 deaths per day) ( Table 1 ). Figure 2 shows predictions for the course of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil in four prospective scenarios based on the number of daily new deaths. Although the number of daily deaths is around 1200, while these lines are written (June 21), the rapid increase in the number of daily new cases on last weeks made the firstand more optimistic scenario (a)to be less probable, since the number of daily new cases today is already out of the fit curve (Fig. 2a, black circles) . Weibull distribution fits the actual data for daily new cases with similar precision in scenarios b and c (R 2 = 0.87), what prevents a precise prediction on which scenario is the most probable. However, DDlag value, estimated by applying LR in Eq. 3, points to a prospective scenario that lies between 1750 and 2000 daily new deaths (scenarios c and d, respectively).",

The countries that were selected for this sample already started to relax restriction measures, what could be monitored by the OxCGRT index [6] . The day in which the first decrease in the OxCGRT index was observed, in such countries, was used as a landmark for the starting date of relaxing restriction measures (see \"Material and methods\"). Based on this, it was possible to determine, from Weibull fit curves in Fig. 2 , the date in which it would be registered less than 628 deaths per day (3 deaths per million habitants) and/or less than 1490 cases per day (20 cases per million habitants) of COVID-19 in Brazil. Table 1 displays the estimated dates in which Brazil would present less than 628 daily deaths and less than 1490 daily cases, as well as the total death toll at the end of COVID-19 pandemics, for each scenario. As shown, considering the criteria described above, Brazil would present conditions for start to ease restriction measures on July 5, in the most optimistic scenario (a). This prediction date may be extended up to August 29 as the epidemic scenario is changed to the most pessimistic one (d).",

Consequently, the higher will be the death toll at the end of pandemic. Measuring the correlation between t 0 values for the number of daily new deaths (open circles) and the overall death tall (Table 1) , it is possible to estimate that each additional day that Brazil takes to bend the daily new deaths curve adds more 1685 deaths to the overall death toll of COVID-19 in Brazil (R 2 = 0.9890). Many papers have been published on the importance of lockdown measure, but little effort has been dedicated to what are the best criteria to be taken into account to decide the right moment of relaxing quarantine, lockdown, and social isolation measures. There is no consensus on the right time to ease, or finish, the lockdown measures toward COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, each country responds in a particular way, taking into account many subjective criteria. Rawson and coworkers have used a Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model to evaluate two potential lockdown release strategies, as well as the best moment to apply them, in order to limit recurrent spread of the disease [30] . In that work, it has been suggested that the first relaxing measures should be taken 2 weeks after the end of the infection peak, what may occur even months after the maximum turning point of new deaths and new cases. In the present work, we did not use scientific or technical criteria to determine the conditions in which the relaxation of stay-at-home measures can safely begin. Criteria adopted here were merely based on the example of selected countries measures and, thus, may be carefully evaluated and, also, equalized with other criteria, before to be considered by health authorities and decision-makers.",

Predictions based on daily data are especially efficient because they can be continuously revised, offering to governments and to health authorities the opportunity of re-conducting their decisions as new data become available. We believe that such predictions can be used by decision-makers in order to define strategies to fight COVID-19, both in the present days and in the near future. Still more, these results depict the primal importance of reinforcing the strict surveillance measures in Brazil, such as hardening lockdown measures, increasing the number of performed tests, and improving the quality of health services and work conditions of health professionals. These measures might be taken in order to flat the infection curve, i.e., the curves for daily new deaths and cases in view to mitigate the social and economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil.",
