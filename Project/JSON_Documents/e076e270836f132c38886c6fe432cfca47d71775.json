Thus, COVID-19 has spread to almost all countries of the world including Nigeria [3] .

In this study, we attempted to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria using the 120-day data for confirmed cases. In addition, we compared the disease spread patterns, death, and the fitted model with seven other countries. Two research questions were consequently addressed: (i) How does COVID-19 spread and mortality compare with other countries in the first 120 days? (ii) Given the prevailing testing regime, interventional efforts and all other things being equal, what is the 3-month projected cumulative cases of COVID-19?",

The epidemic curve for Nigeria differed from the typical propagated epidemic curve that would have been expected for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with person-to-person mode of transmission. COVID-19 reproduction number appears to gain traction with time as estimated to be from 1.4 to 2.5, 3.6 to 4.0, and 2.24 to 3.58 from earlier studies [3, [5] [6] [7] . This indicates that the infection rate continues to increase. Therefore, the observed pattern found in our study agrees with the known pattern of spread of the disease. We also found that a higher number of cases was reported after the relaxation of lockdown than was reported during the lockdown period. The increased spread of the disease after the relaxation of lockdown could be due to poor adherence to the recommended preventive measures in Nigeria. This may be expected because when restrictive measures are lifted, exposures to disease risks become higher. Consequently, an increased number of infections is likely to follow. This is in tandem with evidence from developed countries As at day 120 of the outbreak in the respective countries Table 2 The four predictive models",

However, another plausible explanation for the increase in the number of confirmed cases could be the improved testing capacity in the country which coincided with the lockdown relaxation. Compared with Ghana and South Africa, the testing capacity in Nigeria was generally low. While Nigeria had only 2755 persons tested for COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people, the estimate was 16,206 and 76,067 for Ghana and South Africa respectively [10] . We found a similar pattern in the number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon possibly due to similarity in the capacity for testing in the first 120 days of the disease outbreak. Conversely, a difference was observed in the pattern exhibited by Nigeria compared to four of the seven countries investigated (Mexico, Bangladesh, South Africa and Indonesia). As at day 120 in these four countries, the total COVID-19 tests per 1 million population was strikingly higher than that of Nigeria over the same period [1, 10] . Only Indonesia had a population size that was similar to that of Nigeria while the other countries had a considerably lower population than that of Nigeria. Mexico, Bangladesh, South Africa and Indonesia had environmental factors such as temperature and humidity that were comparable to that of Nigeria [11, 12] . Thus, the reasons that could explain the differences in disease spread pattern between these countries and Nigeria is not immediately clear except for the differences in COVID-19 testing rate. The implication is that community We further found that the distribution of COVID-19-associated deaths observed for Nigeria was comparable to six of the seven countries investigated and aligned perfectly with the Cameroun and Ghana patterns. COVID-19-related death trajectory in Mexico may be explained by the higher number of observed COVID-19 cases recorded within the study period compared to other countries. The similarity in COVID-19 deaths between Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon may be attributed to other factors different from the COVID-19 testing capacity and case management capabilities.",

None of the country data was suited for the exponential model except South Africa, which was suitable for the first 70 days of the outbreak. A similar observation was reported previously on the suitability of the exponential model for fitting the epidemic curve of infectious diseases [15] . Nonetheless, differences in the levels and modes of testing across countries could be responsible for South Africa's exemption. In South Africa, a community testing approach was instituted early unlike in other African countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon. In addition, the marked differences in atmospheric and environmental conditions between countries may constitute potential explanatory variables [11, 12] .",
