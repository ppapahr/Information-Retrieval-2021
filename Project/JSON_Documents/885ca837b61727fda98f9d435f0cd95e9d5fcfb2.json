In addition, with the roll out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs, serosurveillance can also be used to track vaccine immunity. However, the large amount of fieldwork and manpower required for specimen collection and cold-chain transportation for serosurveillance is challenging. During this pandemic, restrictions in movement and physical contact have also meant that collecting venous blood samples for serological testing has been more difficult. The use of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens would provide a more feasible approach to serosurveillance studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies but requires evaluation. To determine if DBS specimens can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, we compared serum and eluates from DBS specimens collected as part of a household contact study.",

Participants who had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test (nasal/throat swab PCR-positive) and their household close contacts were recruited at the Royal Children's Hospital between 10 May and 29 July 2020. Venous blood samples were collected from each participant following informed consent. A subset of samples (N = 95 from 74 participants) had an aliquot of blood (50 \u03bcl/spot \u00d7 4 spots) spotted onto a Guthrie card filter paper (Whatman\u2122 903 filter paper) as DBS for this study. This study was approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC): HREC/63666/RCHM-2019. We used the Mount Sinai Laboratories (USA) ELISA method 4 to determine antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain (RBD) and Spike subunit 1 (S1), the main antigen targets on the virus and are used in most serological assays (Details of DBS specimen processing, ELISA method and statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary).",

There was no significant difference in the RBD-and S1-specific IgG antibody levels between serum and DBS specimens ( Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Moreover, both the RBD and S1-specific IgG antibody levels measured from the DBS specimens strongly correlated with their paired serum samples (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C and D) . To determine if DBS storage duration had a negative effect on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG measurement, we compared paired serum and DBS specimens based on their storage duration prior to assay. There was no effect of DBS storage time on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and this was observed for samples up to 112 days ( Fig. 2A and B ); no significant difference was observed in measured RBD-and S1-specific IgG antibody levels for paired samples stored for \u226430 or >30 days (Supplementary Fig S2) .",
