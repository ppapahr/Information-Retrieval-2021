Consequently, we show that percolation analysis of such interdependent systems provides no information about the distinguishing features of viruses. Instead, we model the propagation of perturbations from viral nodes through the whole system, using bio-chemical and regulatory dynamics, to obtain the spreading patterns and compare the average impact of viruses on human proteins. Finally, we exploit Gibbsian-like density matrices, recently introduced to map network states, to quantify the impact of viruses on the macroscopic functions of human PPI network, such as von Neumann entropy. The inverse temperature \u03b2 is used as a resolution parameter to perform a multiscale analysis. We use the above information to cluster together viruses and our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 groups with a number of pathogens associated with respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV, Influenza A and Human Adenovirus (HAdV) at the smallest scales, more influenced by local topological features.

Arguably, the simplest conceptual framework to assess how and why a networked system loses its functionality is via the process of percolation 19 . Here, the structure of interconnected systems is modeled by a network G with N nodes, which can be fully represented by an adjacency matrix A (A ij = 1 if nodes i and j are connected, it is 0 oth- 20 . This point of view assumes that, as a first approximation, there is an intrinsic relation between connectivity and functionality: when the node removal occurs, the more capable of remaining assembled a system is, the better it will perform its tasks. Hence, we have a quantitative way to assess the robustness of the system. If one wants to single out the role played by a certain property of the system, instead of selecting the nodes randomly, they can be sequentially removed following that criteria. For instance, if we want to find out what is the relevance of the most connected elements on the functionality, we can remove a fraction of the nodes with largest degree 21, 22 . Technically, the criteria can be whatever metric that allows us to rank nodes, although in practical terms topologically-oriented protocols are the most frequently used due to their accessibility, such as degree, betweenness, etc. Therefore percolation is, at all effects, a topological analysis, since its input and output are based on structural information.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "(19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1286, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 129, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "In the past, the usage of percolation has been proved useful to shed light on several aspects of protein-related networks, such as in the identification of functional clusters 23 and protein complexes 24 , the verification of the quality of functional annotations 25 or the critical properties as a function of mutation and duplication rates 26 , to name but a few. Following this research line, we perform the percolation analysis to all the PPI networks to understand if this technique brings any information that allows us to differentiate among viruses. The considered protocols are the random selection of nodes, the targeting of nodes by degree -i.e., the number of connections they haveand their removal by betweenness centrality -i.e., a measure of the likelihood of a node to be in the information flow exchanged through the system by means of shortest paths.

Other clusters are less sharp and depend on the choice of threshold, here chosen arbitrarily as 60 % of the maximum distance between the clusters.we use statistical physics of complex networks to go beyond the microscopic details provided by propagation patterns and analyze the macroscopic features of virus-human PPI networks.A variety of methods have been introduced to analyze the information content of complex networks32,33 . Since networks can be viewed as collections of entangled entities, a density matrix can be used to describe their state as in quantum statistical mechanics. While some choices of the density matrix have been shown to be unphysical34,35 , Gibbsian-like density matrices have been successfully used to define spectral entropy36,37 and estimate the information content of empirical complex networks at multiple scales, with applications ranging from transportation systems 38 to the human microbiome36 and the human brain 39 . The density matrix is defined in terms of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix L = D \u2212 A, where D is defined as D ii = k i \u03b4 ij and k i = j A ij denotes the degree of i-th node. The Laplacian matrix governs the diffusion dynamics on top of the network and is involved in the linear stability analysis of many complex dynamics, such as synchronization.

Our findings suggest that viral components have negligible effect on the structural properties of the human PPI network, therefore classical topological analysis is not able to unravel distinctive patterns. Alternatively, we analyzed the propagation of perturbations from viral components into the human PPI network, allowing us to compare viruses in terms of their average impact on human proteins and their corresponding biochemical spreading patterns. While this analysis provides microscopic details about the complex interactions between viral and human proteins, it is not sufficient to identify distinctive patterns relating SARS-CoV-2 and existing viruses. Finally, from the analysis of macroscopic features in terms of information-theoretic and thermodynamic-like quantities, such as the von Neumann entropy, the Massieu function and internal energy, we have been able to cluster the viruses across multiple scales, determined by the resolution parameter \u03b2. According to our results, SARS-CoV-2 shows similarity with SARS-CoV, influenza A and a number of other viruses causing respiratory infections, as one could plausibly expect. At larger scales, where the interplay between the topology of virus-host interaction and information flow dynamics becomes more relevant, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more similar to viruses like HIV1 and HTLV1. As mentioned earlier, the response of COVID-19 patients has been shown to be positive to drugs used for treating HIV infections, like lopinavir-ritonavir 2-5 . Our findings, in parallel with such a clinical evidence, suggests a rather unexplored relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV1, motivating further theoretical and experimental investigations.Overall, our framework opens the doors for further analyses of viral agents from the perspective of statistical physics, highlighting the sensitivity of macroscopic functions, such as spectral entropy, to small variations across interaction networks and, more specifically, virus-host interactomes. Even though the analysis of perturbation propagation patterns lacks the same sensitivity, according to our results it provides microscopic details about the interactions between viral and human proteins that complement the macroscopic view, together enhancing our understanding of this novel coronavirus from a new perspective which can provide a mathematical ground for the exploration of further clinical treatments and biological understanding.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF10": {"text": "shows a visualization of the human interactome where proteins targeted by viruses are highlighted.
