Measles, for instance, killed one in five young children on Rotuma, an isolated Polynesian island, in 1911. The islanders had not previously encountered measles. 6 Bites of insects and other arthropods -such as mosquitoes, ticks and blackflies -can transmit several potentially serious infections, of which malaria is the most notorious. But there are numerous other threats. For instance, Ixodes ricinus -the deer or sheep tick -can transmit the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, the UK's most common tick-borne human infection, 7 with, PHE estimates, 2000 to 3000 new cases in England and Wales each year. 8 Pathogens carried by ticks also cause tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) -a viral infection that affects about 10,000 people across Europe each year -and rickettsioses, caused by members of the Rickettsia genus of bacteria. Species of Rickettsia can cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Mediterranean spotted fever and African tick-bite fever. In the UK, TBE and rickettsioses occur in returning travellers. However, British ticks now host pathogenic rickettsiae. 7 \"At present, these infections pose minimal risk to the non-travelling public,\" Professor Morgan notes. \"However, if the vectors become more common in the UK and the number of cases of infection among travellers from endemic areas increases, there is the potential for UK-acquired cases to occur.\"",
