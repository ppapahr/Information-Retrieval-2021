            "text": "I would argue, rather, that we need to be reminded of the central premises of sociology and what we bring to table precisely because we have been successful, even if quietly so. In essence, the major dilemma that we confront at present is that the \"promise\" is obvious, not only to ourselves, but to others. The idea that context matters has taken hold across the sociomedical sciences, the bio-medical sciences, and even the basic sciences like genetics and cognitive science (see Pescosolido 2006 for a review). Ideas of health and health care disparities (which we have called inequalities for over 100 years in sociology, and for over 50 years in the subfield of medical sociology); fundamental causes (as Link and Phelan, 1995 , so eloquently labeled sociologists' baseline concern with power, stratification and social differentiation); and social networks as vectors of social and organizational influence (now renamed \"Network Science\") stand front and center in the concerns of the National Institutes of Health and other major scientific organizations. Whether our arguments and research findings have been persistent, robust and convincing, or whether these insights coincide with the recognition by the more reductionist sciences that even their most sophisticated approaches cannot solve the problems of the body and the mind alone, is of little consequence. When the newly appointed director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project, announces the launching of a special program to increase attention and resources to basic behavioral and social science (November 18, 2009, www. oppnet.nih.gov) using phrases like \"synergy,\" \"vital component,\" and \"complex factors that affect individuals, our communities and our environment,\" the crack in the door of mainstream biomedical science becomes just a little wider, and the seat at the table becomes just a little more possible.",

            "text": "Sometimes, the role of sociologists is obvious in these new declarations of important directions in science and medicine; other times, they appear as \"discoveries\" without much, if any, attribution. But to belabor the historical debt that contemporary health and health care researchers and policymakers may owe us is a waste of both time and energy. Sociology has a history of conceptualizing social life, making that view understandable, and having its insights and even its language absorbed as \"common sense\" into both academic and civil life (e.g., clique, identity, self-fulfilling prophecy, social class, disparities, networks). More to the point, Mills argued that the sociological imagination is a \"task\" as well as a \"promise.\" He described that task -\"to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two within society\" (1959, p. 6 ) -through the work of major sociologists of his time as \"comprehensive,\" \"graceful,\" \"intricate,\" \"subtle,\" and \"ironic.\" With \"many-sided constructions,\" a focus on meaning, and a willingness to look across social institutions like polity, the economy, and the domestic sphere (1959, p. 6) , Auguste Comte and others came to define sociology's aspiration as the \"Queen of the Social Sciences,\" a phrase more commonly used now by economists or political scientists to describe their discipline. Similarly, Mills (1959) sees sociology as holding \"the best statements of the full promise of the social sciences as a whole\" (1959, p. 24) , and I have argued elsewhere that taking sociology's view of social interactions in networks represents one promising approach to integrating the health sciences (Pescosolido 2006) .",

We accept the unexpected, we expect latent functions of policies and actions of even those who are trying to do good, we understand that being an outsider has its advantages in understanding the world, and we embrace the notion of comparison and reject a \"provincial narrowing to the interest to the Western societies\" (1959, p. 12 ). Whenever we look at a life, a \"disease,\" a health care system, or a nation's epidemiological profile, examining which \"values are cherished yet threatened\" (1959, p. 11 ) is inevitable. As Hung (2004) has recently documented for the SARS virus and Epstein (1996) for HIV/AIDS, the societal reactions to viral pandemics are deeply rooted in social cleavages rather than biological fact, whether this reaction unearthed the racist view of the \"Yellow peril\" or the homophobic view of the \"Gay plague.\"",

            "text": "In sum, at this point in time, it may be more important than ever to recall our mission and accept the uneasiness which is endemic (and according to Mills, necessary) to it. The sociological imagination requires \"the capacity to shift from one perspective to another -from the political to the psychological\u2026.to range from the most impersonal and remote transformations to the most intimate features of the human self -and to see the relations between the two\" (1959, p. 7). Our training emphasizes this, our theories conceptualize it, and the wide variety of our research methods reflect it. We bring this self-consciousness to the problems of health, illness, and healing, and hopefully to their solutions. Which subfield of sociology, more than the sociology of health, illness, and healing, provides a critical window into making \"clear the elements of contemporary uneasiness and indifference\" that Mills sees as \"the social scientists' foremost political and intellectual task\" (1959, p. 13) ? While Mills may have been premature, or flat out wrong, in his prediction that the social sciences would overthrow the dominance of the physical and biological sciences, his view was prescient regarding the rising importance of \"context\" in biomedical sciences (1959, p. 13) and increasing doubts about the inevitable and pristine nature of science. As those inside the \"House of Medicine\" itself dare to question the utility of the \"gold standard\" (RCT, the randomized clinical trial) versus observational studies (Concato et al. 2000) , the validity of the placebo as a \"control\" (Leuchter et al. 2002) , and the robustness of \"established\" genetic links (Gelernter et al. 1991) , the radical critiques of the objectivity of science and the inevitability of linear progress in science have come from inside as well as outside (Gieryn 1983; Latour 1999) . It is na\u00efve to assume or even expect a reconstruction of the prestige hierarchy of the sciences, as Mills does to some extent. He forgets that institutional supports undergird that dominance, as any of us who have served on interdisciplinary review panels will attest. Yet, the idea that there may be occasional openings for concerns and approaches by social scientists was prophetic. This may be one of those unique times to work together to push not only our understandings forward, but to foster institutional social change. At the least, it is a time when social scientists, especially sociologists, need to have their voices heard; that is, to have a place at the table to guard against a crass, out-of-date, and generally poor appropriation of the social sciences' basic ideas and tools. Those of us who witnessed a wider acceptance of (even called for) social science methods such as ethnography in the 1980s and 1990s in the mental health research agenda, also witnessed the dumping of the term into one sentence of a traditional research proposal without any idea of its complexity, rigor, or even utility to expand the limited insights of clinical research. Bearman (2008, p. vi) downplays concerns that this kind of scientific diffusion may \"distort the sociological project\" because \"the beauty of sociology as a discipline rests in its hybridity with respect to method and data\" and new research concerns can become a potential \"lever\" for sociology to escape some of its own \"hegemonic\" foci.",

This imagery of cultural landscapes and boundaries (Gieryn 1983 (Gieryn , 1999 seems to fit the multifaceted, complex nature of health, illness, and healing in the current era. Individuals use cultural maps to make sense of the world, affecting information availability and personal understandings, as well as signaling possible appropriate action. While Gieryn's work focuses on professions, primarily scientists and the rhetorical strategies they use to establish, extend, and protect their societal authority, these ideas have broader relevance, not only for other professionals like physicians, but for the public. In particular, the concept of \"boundary-work\" becomes central as individuals, whatever their position, confront illness, define disease, and react to treatment options. The term \"cultural mapping,\" targeting the terrain of choices, as well as individuals' recognition, acceptance, or rejection of them, informs us about the boundaries of their experience, and values shaping action, whether their own (as in rational choice theory) or that of others (as in labeling, social influence, and social control theories).",

Yet, as Francis Collins and others have noted, we are only beginning to understand what we have and can learn both in a positive and negative sense. Sociologists have tread into that territory lightly, now starting to work their way toward the profound implications of this massive project and the larger cultural institutions that created and continue to nurture it (e.g., Phelan 2005) . Perhaps, the most obvious is the potential for collaborative projects on epigenetics and on gene-environment interactions (g x e) (i.e., how environmental conditions which include society not only trigger or suppress genetic predispositions but, in fact, change the genome itself; Szyf 2009). While complicated, this may not be the most challenging. It was a recent special issue of the American Journal of Sociology (Bearman 2008, p. vi) that turned an obvious research question on its head: \"What can we learn about social structure and social processes, and what can we learn about our accounts about social structure and social processes, by 'thinking about genetics'?\" Fleshing this out even a little raises classic sociological questions. How is the genetics agenda constructed by medicine, by insurance companies, by the public, and by science itself, to name just a few? What does this mean for the definition and behavioral implications of human health, legitimate constructions of illness by the public and the profession, shifting definitions of vulnerability, and changes in the nature and targets of prejudice and discrimination? While bioethicists and philosophers have asked and deliberated on these questions, medical sociologists bring evidence to bear on the creation, maintenance, and effects of this now dominant weltanschauung in medicine, science, and society. We have the tools to ensure that the powerful forces of society are understood, elaborated, and included in our understandings of the onset of what becomes labeled disease and disorder. We have the tools to uncover the unexpected, latent functions of this direction which, in themselves, will raise new challenges for the very institutions that placed their hopes in \"the language of God\" (Collins 2006 ).",

The first translation dilemma, which can be referred to as a dissemination problem, suggests a need for more effective ways to communicate information between scientists and \"endusers.\" The second translation dilemma, an implementation problem (also the efficacy-effectiveness gap), suggests a need to understand how to translate science into services that result in meaningful clinical care (National Advisory Mental Health Council 2000) .

            "text": "Each of these suggests complicated problems, all recast as problems of \"translation,\" for a diverse array of stakeholder communities and, to date, traditional research approaches have not offered good answers. Each calls for sociological research on a series of basic questions. First, why do providers and consumers fail to take advantage of cutting-edge science? A frequent complaint expressed by research scientists, payers, and policy makers is that cutting-edge interventions are neither adopted in day-to-day clinical work nor accepted by individuals with health problems who might benefit. Second, why do treatments that have been \"proven\" to work in randomized clinical trials fail to work in real world settings? A continual frustration of providers is that clinical research fails to take into account the challenges of day-to-day clinical work and does not offer a realistic understanding of the complexities and limitations of providing care. A similar frustration of consumers and advocates is that clinical research fails to take into account the complex realities of the lives of persons who fall ill, especially those with chronic and stigmatized problems. Third, why has health services research not been able to bridge the gap to allow proven clinical interventions to find application to the \"real world\" needs of consumers, practitioners, payers, and policy makers (Pellmar and Eisenberg 2000) ? Each of these requires an understanding of \"cultures\" -the culture of the public, the culture of the clinic, the culture of community, and of organizations. Sociological research holds the potential to understand how cultures are shaped; how they are enacted; how they clash or coincide with one another; and how, in the end, cultural scripts facilitate, retard, or even prohibit institutional social change. Sometimes, these discussions have the reductionist tone of lack of motivation without understanding the power of institution and resource as well as the social network structures that cripple innovation. More importantly, these challenges call for a holistic approach to research in which different levels of change, as well as the individuals in them, are conceptualized as linked and intertwined, with outcomes measured through innovative quantitative approaches and mechanisms observed through in-depth qualitative observations. In no way would such studies exclude the expertise of other scientists; indeed they call for it. However, the multilayered, multimethod and connected approach inherent in medical sociology provides an overarching organizing framework that can facilitate the integration of different interdisciplinary insights (Pescosolido 2006 ).",

            "text": "Ironically, exactly 100 years ago, the Flexner Report \"closed the books\" on the blueprint for the primary structure and power of medicine in America. The 1910 document, crafted by middle-class men with middle-class values building the new institutions of industrial society, called for the active and specific funneling of large amounts of money from the new industrial tycoons who, themselves, had other ideas about what the US health care system should look like (Pescosolido and Martin 2004) . However, drawing from the recent \"successes\" of the \"new\" scientific medical schools of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the Flexner Report set a trajectory and the Rockefeller Foundation fiscally supported a process of mimetic isomorphism for other emergent medical institutions. America's health care system was built primarily with private funds, dominated by the allopathic physician, and supported though a fee-for-service economy (Freidson 1970; Starr 1982) . The era from the Flexner report until President Nixon's proclamation of a \"Health Care Crisis\" in 1970 has been described by McKinlay and Marceau (2002) as the \"Golden Age of Doctoring,\" by Clarke and her colleagues as the \"Medicalization Era\" (Clarke and Shim 2010) , and by us, using Eliot Freidson's (1970) terms, as \"The Era of Professional Dominance\" (Pescosolido and Boyer 2001) . Working in a primarily private health care system, physicians determined both the nature of medical care and the arrangements under which it was provided. Even with the introduction of private (and later public) insurance, the American system remained an anomaly on the global landscape. The richest country in the world, which spent more on research, technology, and care than any other, also was home to the greatest number and proportion of uninsured citizens and to standard indicators of population health that fell way below those of countries with fewer resources and less of them devoted to health. 1 Taking \"The Promise\" Seriously",

How much of our view of \"change\" can or cannot be backed up by real data? After all, given larger claims of the \"consumer backlash\" or \"consumer revolution\" that would change the power balance, we find little significant decrease in the public's view of the authority or expertise of physicians . If there is a decrease in the confidence in American medicine, as Schlesinger (2002) claims, how much of this disillusionment is not exclusive to modern medicine, but rather reflects a generalized reaction to social institutions, developed in the modern, industrial era, to larger changes in contemporary society (Pescosolido and Rubin 2000) . Rubin (1996) argued that the social and economic bases of modern society were \"tarnished\" in the early 1970s, marking a general turning point for social institutions in the face of diminished growth that had accompanied the post World War II era.

Sociology weathered these critiques, changing sometimes in small ways and other times in large ways, but most often, noting the critique, integrating it in some way and to some extent in some corner of the discipline, and moving on. Sociology has survived functionalism and its dominant status attainment theory in the 1960s and 1970s, Marxism and the 1980s dominating return to historical sociology, and postmodernism's declaration that everything is virtually unknowable except through one's own personal experiences (in which Anthropology did not fare so well as a discipline; Pescosolido and Rubin 2000) . Sociology is likely to both encounter and survive many more of these critiques; perhaps ironically because of the embedded Catholicism in its theory and method. While our richness lies in the breadth and inclusion, as noted above, this is also the source of confusion regarding sociology's \"brand.\"",

While this approach places disciplines at the center of discussions, Pace and Middendorf (2004, p. 4 ) note the critical but paradoxical requirement to consider the boundaries that we cross with other disciplines.

Bringing the two concerns of relevance and specialization to the same point on the intellectual map, Collins took up the concern of whether sociology \"has lost its public impact or even its impulse to public action\" (1986, p. 1336) , pointing to the proliferation of specialties as the source of internal, disciplinary boundary disputes, including pushing to the fringes those sociologists who took a more applied approach. While our subfields have allowed us to make the increasingly large professional association and annual meetings feel smaller, more personal and relevant, building up an \"espirit de corps\" (1986, p. 1341 ) that facilitates the socialization of our new colleague, Collins sees the result that we \"scarcely recognize the names of eminent practitioners in specialties other than our own\u2026having become congeries of outsiders to each other\" (1986, p. 1340) .",

That is, health and health care is only one of a number of life chances affected by larger contextual forces. Dramatic instances of unequal life chances cannot help but draw the interests of sociologists. The increase in interdisciplinary research teams and the relative \"wealth\" of the NIH (e.g., versus the NSF) has brought more sociologists into research that addresses health, illness, and healing.

This is not misrepresentation, but missed opportunity. Classic works embraced by medical sociology were penned by sociologists who did not appear to consider themselves \"medical sociologists\" (e.g., Erving Goffman, Everett Hughes). Rather, in contemporary research, the lack of training in and knowledge of medical sociology as a subfield yields a weaker picture of sociology's contributions to our understanding of the social forces that shape health, illness, and healing.

In fact, there is no immediate issue, because both sociologists and medical sociologists \"find\" much of their work. However, not all of their research can be fully integrated into the discipline without their presence, literally and figuratively, in sociology venues. The problem is that, in their geographic positions outside the discipline, they will not likely train the next generation of medical sociologists. In addition, many of these sociologists are precisely the ones who focus on health care organization and policy, a topic about which David Mechanic finds the subfield relatively weak in addressing. With the demise of strong medical sociology training programs in the top ranked departments, the two problems mentioned above are magnified. If the majority of sociologists tackling issues of health care organization and reform are outside our training spheres, this will likely exacerbate the shortage of a new generation of medical sociologists pursuing these topics. Avoiding the \"loss\" of their expertise to schools of public health, medicine and management alone, without a parallel emphasis in the subfield, requires effort on both sides, with each valuing the contributions and venues of the other.",

With \"science\" mistakenly equated with quantitative research, Collins contends that sociology, like other sciences, engages in the \"formulation of generalized principles, organized into models of the underlying processes that generate the social world\" (Collins 1989 (Collins , p. 1124 . Similarly, to righteously equate medical sociology only with publication in sociological journals, but not publication in the general or medical journals, is equally problematic. The problem is how, in this era of proliferating opportunities for sociologists in diverse employment positions and in a wider range of journals, can we take advantage of all of these contributions and pass them on to the next generation? Sociological knowledge can advance, as Collins (1989) notes, with a coherence of theoretical conceptions across different areas and methods of research. Critique is good, and something that sociologists are extraordinarily proficient in; but this is useful only to the purpose of moving our understanding of the world forward. This volume is a first step, we hope, in facilitating that coherence by explicitly bringing together these three different strains of medical sociology, by bringing their authors in contact with one another, with other medical sociologists, and with the next generation of researchers. That is, we have tried to take direct account of the potential contributions from diverse vantage points on the landscape of sociology. Specifically, the editors have sought out contributions from each of the three communities of sociological research on health, illness, and healing, including making an attempt, albeit a preliminary one, to escape the surface of American medical sociology. We ignore where on the intellectual and field/subfield/disciplinary map they come from. In this way, we hope to complement the Handbook of Medical Sociology, now in its 6th edition, which has served since 1963 to represent the cutting edge of the subfield.",

In fact, in this first section, we step back even from the map of sociology so as not to ignore two facts -other disciplines aim to understand the same phenomena as medical sociology, further complicating our task of surveying existing contributions and gathering \"leads;\" and the U.S. brand of medical sociology, and sociology in general, tends to take one kind of perspective that may have different contours from the uniquely salient insights brought by medical sociologists in other countries. Thus, Rogers and Pilgrim, from the University of Manchester and University of Central Lancashire, respectively, follow this introduction by demarcating our relationship to other sociomedical disciplines from the UK landscape. Most importantly, taking the case of mental health, psychiatry, and sociology, they examine how these disciplines approach the same problems, how they construct them, and whether their contributions even matter to \"science.\" They look at boundary disputes and collaborations as they have played out in the UK, arguing that boundaries have been movable historically. Conflicts and separation followed early conversations and collaboration. Yet, they see signs of a return to more congenial shared intellectual space that stems from the movement to an integrated team approach in treatment and new substantive \"identities\" like health services research which situate individuals of different approaches onto common property.",

We also go to and beneath the micro-foundations of macrosociology that Collins (1981) addressed. While our focus may be on the \"illness career,\" there are levels below the individual which have to be reckoned with if we are to get past the old nature vs. nurture dichotomies. Thus, while macro levels can match the cartographic metaphor more-or-less literally of \"place,\" the sociological insight of vertical integration also guide us to more micro levels below the surface of the individual (e.g., their genetic inheritance). But at each level, the NEM argues that sociology must explicitly measure contextual factors and the connecting mechanisms of influence, calling for multi-method approaches which maximize the ability of empirical research to match \"the promise.\"",

We start with a look across countries, the area of comparative health systems, where Ruggie argues that there may be those who remain dubious about lessons that can be learned from cross-national analyses. She aims to convince them, admirably so, by pointing to the well-known paradox that was alluded to earlier about the high spending of resources and the low level of return in the U.S. She identifies persistent barriers in aims and means that result in inequitable health care in the U.S. Ruggie outlines and documents eight lessons about health care systems that the U.S. can learn from the experience of other nations. She ends by pointing to the ubiquitous relationship between poverty and poor health, in all countries, and the final lesson which supports the role that efforts outside the health care system have in improving health outcomes. Beckfield and Olafsdottir push this further, arguing that the welfare state offers a window into understanding how societies organize their economic, political, and cultural landscape. In turn, different forms of social organization are critical to understanding the causes of health, illness, and healing, and how these reverberate through the lives of individuals and societies. They lay out types and mechanisms through politics, health institutions, and lay culture, offering a set of propositions and hypotheses that, if examined empirically, will push our understandings of macrolevel factors and perhaps unearth new suggestions for social change.",

This change reopens the call for a sociological perspective and they provide a roadmap. Part of sociology's turn away from issues of the institutional situation of medicine meant that there has been little attention to the fate of women as doctors since Lorber and Moore's (2002) pioneering 1984 study. Finally, Boulis and Jacobs give us an update on the status of women in medicine. Taking us past even the insights of their comprehensive project (2008), providing the necessary background to understand where women are in the profession, they elaborate on whether medicine's early sexist climate has changed, even if only around the edges. In the end, they conclude that progress has been slow at best; and, if and how the profession changes vis-\u00e1-vis gender has more to do with structural pressures than changing values.",

Figert begins this journey through the community, asking whether or not medicalization theory has underplayed the potential of lay individuals in the medicalization process. The thread of reevaluating our theoretical concepts that revolve around professional power continues, with a reconsideration of Zola, Conrad, Clarke, and Epstein but expanding consideration to a more explicit role of expertise. This includes the expertise of the lay person as well as the expertise of professionals, noting that much current discussion debates the influence of the former. Tying into the earlier chapters by Brown and colleagues, she brings up how social movements may have shifted the landscape of medicine, and she reminds us of the formality of the classic formulations in Parsons' patient role. This opens the path for May's reformulation of Parsons' \"vision\" of the physician-patient interaction. While recognizing that the organization of health care matters because it penetrates the clinical encounter, May targets the social relationship in the clinic as the place where their effects are mobilized and enacted. The arrival of \"disease management\" and \"self-management\" have become a routine part of \"mundane medicine,\" the care that comes with the greater prominence of chronic illness and disease. Digging further into the encounter, Heritage and Maynard review research from process, discourse, and conversational analyses that reveal in detail how the clinical encounter proceeds, what its key turning points are, and how there has been a clear and gradual movement to greater power balance between physicians and patients. Finally, Wright acknowledges that technological advances have widened the examination room, bringing with them greater expertise but also challenges from the public. With electronic records and publically available health information technology, Wright argues that sociologists should track the ramifications of these changes on trust, confidentiality, authority, and the social dynamics of how information is collected, managed, and used by both providers and their clients.",

Drawing from the notion of cumulative disadvantage across time and levels of organization, the Social Cultural Framework for Health Care Disparities serves to guide further and more integrated studies. They set the stage for more specific concerns. Among these, areas that continue to attract research attention are race and gender. In a review of the black-white differences in health, Jackson and Cummings point to the paradox of the Black middle class. Counterintuitive to the SES-health gradient, they provide evidence that the Black middle class does not fare better in health status than the White lower class, and end by suggesting that accumulated network capital, limited by residential segregation, is ripe for future research. In a similar vein, Read and Gorman turn their attention to gender. They give an overview of what we know about male-female differences in mortality and morbidity, theories used to explain these, and three challenges that remain in the gendered profile of health -immigration, the life course, and co-morbidities between mental and physical health. To assist in future research, the final note in this section involves methods for unraveling the mechanisms that underlie many of the associations that have been documented. Pairing sociologists who come from different methodological corners of the sociological landscape, Watkins, Swidler and Biruk describe and illustrate the use of \"hearsay ethnography.\" Relying on individuals in the communities they study to hear and record what their social network ties discuss, they show the advantages over traditional survey and ethnographic methods in gathering data on \"meaning\" in everyday life.",

He reviews traditional genetics approaches, expressing apprehension about the endogeneity problem inherent in many studies and the current limits in mapping gene-gene interactions.
