First, we apply the implicit time integration scheme for the three-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Namely, we utilize the Douglas-Gunn time integration scheme. Second, in every time step, we apply the residual minimization method for stabilization of the numerical solution. Third, we use isogeometric analysis with B-spline basis functions for the numerical discretization. We perform alternating directions splitting of the resulting system of linear equations, so the computational cost of the sequential LU factorization is linear O(N ). We test our method on the three-dimensional simulation of the advectiondiffusion problem. We parallelize the solver for shared-memory machine using the GALOIS framework.",

The first papers concerning the ADI method were published in 1960 [1, 3, 5, 19] . This method is still popular for fast solutions of different classes of problems with finite difference method [8, 9] . In its basic version, the method introduces intermediate time steps, and the differential operator splits into the x, y (and z in 3D) components. As a result of this operation, on the left-hand side, we only deal with derivatives in one direction, while the rest of the operator is on the right-hand side. The resulting system of linear equations has a multi-diagonal form, so the factorization of this system is possible with a linear O(N ) computational cost. It is a common misunderstanding that the direction splitting solvers are limited to simple geometries.",

The direction splitting method has been rediscovered to solve the isogeometric L 2 projection problem over regular grids with tensor product B-spline basis functions [6, 7] . The direction splitting, in this case, is performed with respect to space, and the splitting is possible by exploiting the Kronecker product structure of the Gram matrix with tensor product structure of the B-spline basis functions. The L 2 projections with IGA-FEM were applied for performing fast and smooth simulations of explicit dynamics [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 20] .

The test space is larger than the trial space, and the inner product and the weak form blocks are rather sparse matrices. Therefore, the dimension of the system of linear equations is at least two times larger than the original system of equations arising from standard Galerkin method. In the DPG method, the test space is broken in order to obtain a block-diagonal matrix G and the Schur complements can be locally computed over each finite element. The price to pay is the presence of the additional fluxes on the element interfaces, resulting from breaking the test spaces, so the system over each finite element looks like \u23a1",

In this paper, we want to avoid dealing with fluxes and broken spaces since it is technically very complicated. Thus, we stay with the unbroken global system (4) and then we have to face one of the two possible methods. The first one would be to apply adaptive finite element method, but then the cost of factorization in 3D would be up to four times slower than in the standard finite element method and broken DPG (without the static condensation). This is because depending on the structure of the refined mesh, we will have a computational cost of the multi-frontal solver varying between O(N ) to O(N 2 ) [33] , and our N is two times bigger than in the original weak problem, and 2 2 = 4. This could be an option that we will discuss in a future paper.",

In [16] , we described the parallel distributed memory implementation of the explicit dynamics solver, again without implicit time integration scheme and residual minimization method. In [14] , we described the parallel shared-memory implementation of the explicit dynamics solver, with the same restrictions as before. In [13, 17] we applied the explicit dynamics solver for two and three-dimensional tumor growth simulations. In all of these papers, we did not used implicit time integration schemes, and we did not perform operator splitting on top of the residual minimization method. In [20] , we investigate different time integration schemes for two-dimensional residual minimization method for advection-diffusion problems.

It is just a linear O(N ) computational cost solver that performs Gaussian elimination for matrices having Kronecker product structure. Thus, the solution obtained by the solver is exact (up to the round-off errors). In this sense, we do not present the iterations or convergence of the ADI solver, since it is executed once per each time step. In other words, we can perform 300 Gaussian elimination, each with 1,000,000 unknowns, with the high accuracy resulting from the ADI direct solver (only round-off errors are involved), on a laptop with eight cores, with the implicit method, within 1.5 h.

We can draw the following conclusions from the presented plots: -For linear B-splines for trial and quadratic B-splines for testing and large grids 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 and 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 the speedup grows up to 16 cores. It is around 10-11 for 16 cores. The corresponding efficiency for 16 cores is around 0.7. Then, for 32 cores the speedup went down since for more than 20 cores used the hyperthreading is utilized. -For quadratic B-splines for trial and cubic B-splines and large grids 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 and 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 the speedup grows up to 16 cores. It is around 12-14 for 16 cores. The corresponding efficiency for 16 cores is around 0.8-0.9. Then, for 32 cores and 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 mesh the speedup grows up to 17, and for 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 mesh is decreases slightly since for more than 20 cores the hyperthreading is used. -For cubic B-splines for trial and quartic B-splines for testing and large grids 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 and 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 the speedup grows up to 32 cores. It is around 15 for 16 cores (near perfect speedup) and around 20 for 32 cores, where we use the hyperthreading (more than 20 cores). The corresponding efficiency for 16 cores is around 0.9-1.0. Then, for 32 cores the efficiency decreases slightly down to 0.6-0.7. -Increasing the mesh size increases the parallel scalability up to 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 mesh. Larger mesh, 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 64 performs slightly worse than 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 32 mesh. -The most interesting observation is that while increasing the B-splines order",
