At the moment, the genomic structure, characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. Based upon this information, several drugs including the directly acting antivirals have been proposed to treat people with coronavirus disease 2019 . This rapid review aims to describe the directly acting antivirals that have been examined for use in the management of COVID-19. Searches were conducted in three electronic databases, supplemented with a search on arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChinaXiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for studies examining the use of antivirals in COVID-19 to identify for case reports, case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled studies describing the use of antivirals in COVID-19. Data were extracted independently and presented narratively. A total of 98 studies were included, comprising of 38 published studies and 60 registered clinical trials. These drugs include the broad spectrum antivirals such as umifenovir, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Other drugs that have been used include the nucleosidase inhibitors and polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitors which are currently approved for prevention of influenza infections.

The outbreak was found to be caused by a novel virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cheng and Shan, 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . Since then, the cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in every single continent around the world. With over nine million individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 and over 450 thousand death as of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 is now a public health emergency. In many individuals with COVID-19, they often present with a decrease in both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells count and suffer from acute respiratory syndrome for 7 to 10 days due to the rapid viral replication (Cheng and Shan, 2020; Zhou F. et al., 2020) . Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to SARS-CoV, characterized by fever, dry cough, dyspnoea or shortness of breath, diarrhea, sore throat, muscle ache, and vomiting in some patients (Meo et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 255, "text": "(Cheng and Shan, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 256, "end": 278, "text": "Wu and McGoogan, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 749, "end": 771, "text": "(Cheng and Shan, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 772, "end": 793, "text": "Zhou F. et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1016, "text": "(Meo et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1039, "text": "Wu and McGoogan, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that enters the mammalian cell through an interaction of viral spike glycoprotein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2 ) receptor (Fehr and Perlman, 2015) . Following receptor binding, the virus uses the host cell receptor and endosome to enter the cell and synthesizes viral polyproteins that encode for the replicase-transcriptase complex. The virus then synthesizes RNA using its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to synthesize structural proteins leading to completion of assembly and release of viral particles (Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Cheng and Shan, 2020) . Genomic sequencing of the virus has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a high similarity to the bat-derived SARS-CoV, with approximately 79% identity . Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through the respiratory system and droplets, with an incubation period of between 2 and 14 days, and a median period of 4 days (range, 2-7 days) (Livingston et al., 2020) . As such, pharmacological agents that target the spike protein or host's ACE 2 proteins used to treat SARS and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been suggested as potential agents that could be used to treat patients with COVID-19.

Nevertheless, given the significant drug-drug interaction and potential risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal distress such as nausea and diarrhea and hepatotoxicity, caution should be exercised while using this combination given that nearly 20% to 30% of patients have elevated transaminases at presentation (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Wu C. et al., 2020) .

Haerter et al. (2020) in Germany reported the outcomes of a case series of patients living with HIV treated with antiretroviral treatment including darunavir. Of the four patients treated, one died while the other three patients recovered. Shi et al. (2020) similarly reported in their case series on the limited efficacy of darunavir in terms of reducing duration from illness onset to admission and clinical symptoms. Only one small study reported the safety of danoprevir in patients with COVID-19.

RdRP is required during the replication process of RNA viruses as it determines the replication rates and mutation of the virus to adapt to the new host environment, which ultimately influences its fidelity. As such, targeting of RdRP has become another mainstay in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In a pilot prepost study in China, 80 patients with COVID-19 were treated with favipiravir with a loading dose of 1600 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 600 mg three times daily for up to 14 days. After 14 days of treatment, the authors found that patients treated with favipiravir had better treatment outcomes in terms of disease progression and viral clearance compared to those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir .

With no significant adverse events were reported, favipiravir is currently being examined in several clinical trials as a potential target drug for SARS-CoV-2.
