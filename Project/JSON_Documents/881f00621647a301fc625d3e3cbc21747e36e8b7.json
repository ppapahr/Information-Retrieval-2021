Gold nanoparticles (GNP) of average size 12 nm were synthesized by citrate reduction method followed by functionalization with cysteamine hydrochloride for nano-conjugation. Immune response of nano-conjugates of GNP with 26 kDa protein (368-606 amino acids) and 54 kDa protein (112-606 amino acids) were evaluated. In vitro release kinetics of GNP-conjugated 54 kDa (GNP54) and 26 kDa (GNP26) proteins showed slower rate of release of 54 kDa protein as compared to 26 kDa protein. Humoral immune response of mice immunized intramuscularly with GNP54, GNP26 and GNP alone, exhibited HEV-specific IgG titer of 7.9 \u00b1 2.9, 5.686 \u00b1 4.098 and 0.698 \u00b1 0.089, respectively, after 14 days of booster immunization. In addition to this, HEV-specific cellmediated immune response was demonstrated by splenocyte proliferation assay. Analysis of results using one-way ANOVA, showed statistically significant (p value < 0.05) increase in splenocyte proliferation for GNP54-and GNP26-immunized mice in comparison to GNP alone immunized mice. Stimulation index of HEV ORF2 proteins in GNP54/GNP26-immunized mice were comparable to Concanavalin A-treated positive control. These results indicate GNP-based vaccine as a promising candidate for efficiently mediating both humoral and cell-mediated immune response against HEV.",

HEV is responsible for large outbreaks and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis in developing and developed countries (Zhang 2016) . Hepatitis E is considered as a self-limiting disease which resolves within 4-6 weeks and mortality rate is low (0.5-3%). However, in case of pregnant women during the third trimester, mortality rates as high as 30% have been observed (P\u00e9rez-Gracia et al. 2017) . HEV is also responsible for fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure (ALF), acute or chronic liver failure (ACLF) and chronic infection in immune-compromised and transplant patients (Kumar et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "The size of HEV genome is approximately 7.2 kb and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) (Tam et al. 1991) . ORF1 is the largest ORF which encodes for nonstructural polyprotein including viral polymerase (RdRp) through cap-mediated translation. The ORF2 encodes for structural viral protein and smallest ORF3 overlaps with ORF1 and ORF2, are translated from subgenomic RNA. Recently discovered ORF4 is produced through IRES-mediated translation (Nair et al. 2016) . The major viral capsid protein ORF2 is immunogenic and considered as candidate for vaccine development. The structural protein ORF2 is 660 amino acid long and mammalian expression of pORF2 plasmid-produced bands of sizes ~ 74 kDa and ~ 88 kDa corresponding to non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms, respectively (Jameel et al. 1996) . There are three functional domains, S (shell), M (middle), and P (protruding) as evidenced in the X-ray crystal structure of pORF2 and the P domain is the putative binding site for both neutralizing antibody and cellular receptor (Yamashita et al. 2009 ). There is no commercially available vaccine against HEV and antiviral treatment is not considered as standard care for acute viral hepatitis. For recombinant vaccine development, efforts made till date focused mostly on ORF2 capsid protein. This includes mostly truncated forms of ORF2 protein such as trpE-C2 (aa 221-660) (Purdy et al. 1993) , pE2 (aa 394-607) (Im et al. 2001) , HEV 239 (aa 368-606) (Zhang et al. 2013) , 53 kDa (aa 112-578) , 56 kDa (aa 112-607) (Zhang et al. 2002) , 62 kDa (aa 112-660), rHEV VLP (aa 112-608) (Li et al. 2004 ) and T1-ORF2 (aa 126-621) (Huang et al. 2009 ) vaccines. Among these, only two vaccine candidates (HEV 239 and 56 kDa) have been tested for human clinical trials .",

            "text": "Recombinant subunit vaccines based on protein antigens are poorly immunogenic when used alone, therefore, require adjuvants to increase the immune response (Cao et al. 2018 ). Among all commonly used adjuvant, alum is the only licensed adjuvant for human use (Gupta 1998) . However, side effects and safety concerns have been reported for alum as adjuvants (Tomljenovic and A. Shaw 2011). Hence, there is a need of effective adjuvant for vaccine development (Gherardi et al. 2001) . Nanoparticle-based platforms displaying subunit antigenic moieties are now considered novel alternative approach of vaccination. Nanoparticles are useful in both parenteral and mucosal (oral and intranasal) immunization as it can penetrate through capillaries as well as mucosal surfaces (Schneider et al. 2017 ). Polymeric as well as inorganic nanoparticles have been used for vaccination because they act as inert carriers of antigen against which no immune response is elicited (Dhas et al. 2014; Karthick et al. 2020) . The most common inorganic nanoparticle used for vaccination is gold nanoparticles (GNPs), which can act as both adjuvant as well as delivery vehicle (Quach et al. 2018) . The GNPs are biocompatible, nontoxic and enhances immunogenic activity due to its rapid internalization by macrophages and dendritic cells (Bast\u00fas et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2017) . GNPs have inherent properties of an adjuvant, at the same time colloidal gold along with antigen can induce high titer antibody response (Dykman and Khlebtsov 2017; Dykman et al. 2018) . Antigen incorporation in/on nanoparticles can be achieved by encapsulation or physical entrapment and by conjugation or covalent functionalization (Chattopadhyay et al. 2017) . The GNPs can be designed in different shape and sizes such as nanospheres, nanorods, nanoshells (core and shell), and nanostars-which influences immune response (Dykman et al. 2018 , Niikura et al. 2013 . Conjugation of GNPs with the antigens has been reported by several researcher for immunization studies against viral diseases such as Foot and mouth disease virus (Chen et al. 2010) , Influenza virus, West Nile fever virus and Hepatitis B virus (Dykman 2020) . For Hepatitis E virus, use of gold fluorescent nanoclusters were reported earlier for tracking the dynamic behavior of vaccine in vivo and its immune response (Wang et al. 2016 ).",

HEV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune response of two candidate vaccines were evaluated. This study not only evaluated candidate HEV vaccine but also evaluated GNPs as adjuvant and delivery vehicle against HEV.",

These nanoparticles were further characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Figure 3b shows an absorption peak having maxima at 520 nm (Fig. 3b , black solid line) that is characteristic of gold nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were amino functionalized by incubating with cysteamine hydrochloride (Cys-HCl) that is marked by shift in absorption maxima to 521 nm (Fig. 3b , redcolored dash). The GNPs form a strong bond with thiol group of Cys-HCl exposing free amine groups on surface. This was further confirmed by the change in zeta potential of the GNPs from \u2212 20 mV to \u2212 25 mV after cysteamine modification due to the presence of NH 3 + on surface (see Fig. 3c ). Incubation of these amino-functionalized gold nanoparticles with antigens (HEV ORF2 54 kDa and 26 kDa proteins) results in peptide bond formation with carboxyl group of protein molecules. Formation of nano-conjugates between the GNP and protein candidates was confirmed by shift in peak from 521 to 523 nm (blue-colored dash dot dot, Fig. 3b ) and 528 nm (green-colored dot, Fig. 3b ) for 26 kDa and 54 kDa proteins, respectively.

GNPs are promising adjuvant carriers and are well taken up by antigen-presenting cells through endocytosis. GNPs are capable of activating macrophages and other immune cells which serves as the basis for vaccine adjuvants (Dykman and Khlebtsov 2017) . Mice immunized with GNP alone and conjugated with HEV antigens (26 kDa and 54 kDa) had shown increased HEVspecific IgG antibody titer following primary immunization Fig. 4 IgG titer of mice immunized with a nano-conjugates GNP54 (blue-colored triangle), GNP26 (red-colored circled) and GNP only (black-colored square) and b IFA54 (blue-colored triangle), IFA26 (red-colored circle) and IFA only (black-colored square) (data presented as mean \u00b1 SD); western blot image showing presence/absence of antibody in mice sera (day-0, day-42) post-injection with c GNPs only, GNP54 and GNP26 and d IFA only, IFA54 and IFA25. Lanes 1 and 3: day-0 serum of GNP26, GNP54 (c) and IFA26, IFA54 (d); Lanes 2 and 4: day-42 serum of GNP26, GNP54 (c) and IFA26, IFA54 (d). Lanes 5 and 6: day-0 and -42 serum of control group GNP and IFA only and Lane M: prestained protein molecular weight marker (21 days post-immunization) and HEV-specific antibody response further increases after booster immunization at 14 days of first booster and at 7 days after 2nd booster immunization (Fig. 4a) . Significantly high IgG antibody titer was observed for GNP54 as opposed to GNP26 following booster immunization as depicted in Fig. 4a . Similar results were also observed by immunization with adjuvant IFA which indicates that immunogenicity of 54 kDa is much better that 26 kDa HEV protein (Fig. 4b) . It has been observed that 54 kDa protein can form virus-like particles that enhances their immunogenic potential (Chattopadhyay et al. 2017 , Gupta et al. 2020 , Li et al. 2020 . The antibody response is dependent on the neutralization epitopes located at C-terminus of ORF2 (E2, 459-606aa) and bigger protein HEV239 (298-606aa) also contains an additional neutralization epitope . Hence, it is quite likely that an additional neutralizing or conformational epitope might be present in 112-606 aa (54 kDa protein).",
