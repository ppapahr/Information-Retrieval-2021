A computational fluid dynamics model was used to calculate the speed of the airflow and the angle of sampler. Following this, we conducted purification experiments using cigarette smoke, Staphylococcus albus (S. albus) and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) to demonstrate the isolation efficacy. The results showed that the patient's head should be placed as close to the air inlet hood as possible, and an air intake wind speed of 0.86 m/s was effective. The isolation efficacy of the pediatric isolation bed was demonstrated by computational fluid dynamics technology. The isolation efficiency against cigarette smoke exceeded 91.8%, and against S. albus was greater than 99.8%, while the isolation efficiency against HAdV-5 was 100%. The pediatric isolation bed could be used where isolation wards are unavailable, such as in intensive care units and primary clinical settings, to control hospital acquired infections.",

            "text": "Nosocomial infections (NIs), also known as hospital-acquired infections, are mainly caused by airborne pathogens and interpersonal contact in hospitals. It has been reported that the air in hospitals and other health service buildings contains microbial aerosols, and thus controlling the level of pathogenic microbial infections ensures the safety of workers and patient groups (Ai et al. 2019; Lanzerstorfer et al. 2019) . Studies have confirmed that viruses also exist in the air and are very likely to spread via airborne transmission (Guo et al. 2020; Ong et al. 2020) . At present, there are frequent outbreaks of epidemics caused by respiratory viruses (Xiao et al. 2017; Sivagnanasundaram et al. 2019) . For example, norovirus is found seasonally in aerosols, as are avian influenza viruses (Alsved et al. 2019; Shiu et al. 2019) , with airborne transmission representing an important route of dissemination of the H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (Su et al. 2018) . Furthermore, epidemic respiratory diseases have emerged in recent years, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic in 2015 and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2020 (Bertran et al. 2017; Fujiyoshi et al. 2017; Hella et al. 2017; Richard et al. 2017; Tong et al. 2017; Qian and Zheng 2018; Carlos et al. 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 211 countries, causing major challenges not only to China, but also to economic development, travel and transportation, public health systems and public infrastructure worldwide (Singhal 2020) . According to a report, as of February 11, 2020, 3019 medical staff had been BUILD SIMUL https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-021-0761-3 infected with SARS-CoV-2, of which 1,716 were confirmed cases and 0.3% died (Jiang et al. 2020) . Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new device that can prevent transmission and plays a key role in controlling hospital-acquired infection (Gosc\u00e9 and Johansson 2018; Xu et al. 2013 ).",

Although indoor air can spread pathogens, studies have shown that filtering or disinfecting air reduces the risk of viral infections that are transmitted through the air (Tang and Li 2019) . A previous study simulated airflow trajectories and virus concentrations to assess airborne probability or risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus cases (Ai et al. 2019) . A further study demonstrated the effects of different airflow patterns on droplet removal, identifying droplet carryover of infectious diseases, short-and long-range aerial propagation characteristics, and found that increasing ventilation rates effectively reduces the risk of long-range airborne transmission; spread may therefore be inefficient, indicating that an effective way to prevent cross-contamination is to isolate the airflow (Qian and Zheng 2018) . Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling can be used to assess whether hospital ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices and ventilation systems are effective for infection control (Shiu et al. 2019) .",

It can be seen from Figure 4B that the tracer gas concentration in the room was maintained at a low level in all three cases, and the air inlet hood effectively controlled the discharged pollutants (N 2 O), indicating that the isolation effect was good. In addition, as the distance between the child's head and the hood decreased, the concentration of tracer gas in the indoor air was further reduced. Therefore, the shorter the distance between the child's head and the return hood, the more efficient the isolation effect.",

Figure 5A shows that as the air supply volume increased, the corresponding return air volume also increased, so the negative pressure formed locally near the return air vent gradually increased. The negative pressures on the surface of the return air inlets of Case 3 and Case 6 were approximately \u22120.8 Pa, while the negative pressures on the surface of the return port in Cases 4 and 5 were about \u22123.4 Pa and \u22127.6 Pa, respectively, indicating that the area of negative pressure around the air return port was gradually enlarged. Figure 5B shows that as the wind speed of the air supply increased, the degree of turbulence of the indoor air increased. It can be seen from Figure 5C that because the distance between the head of the child and the returning hood was very short, even if the wind speed of the air supply was great, the vigorous movement of the indoor air did not impede the trajectory of the pollutants, and the pollutants were always removed timeously. Thus, the intended isolation effect was obtained and the rationale of the return hood design was justified. The greater the wind speed, the smaller the area of local infection risk, but the energy consumption must increase accordingly, as will the likelihood of patient discomfort caused by hair movement. Therefore, to meet the purification requirements, a larger supply/return wind speed should be used whenever possible, but energy consumption and comfort must also be considered. At the current supply wind speed of 0.86 m/s, the concentration of pollutants in the region surrounding the patient's head is higher, which conveys a certain risk of infection.",

However, the concentration at other sampling points in each gear dropped significantly and was significantly different from the initial concentration (P < 0.05).

The simulation results showed that the larger \u03b8, that is, the shorter the distance between the child and the return hood, the lower the tracer gas concentration in the indoor space, the smaller the influence range, and the better the isolation effect. The larger the air supply volume/return air volume, the better the control effect of exhaled pollutants. Because the patient's head was positioned close to the return air outlet, severe turbulence did not impede the elimination of pollutants. However, the greater the wind speed, the greater the energy consumption and the stronger the blowing sensation felt by the patient. Therefore, a suitable wind speed should be chosen to meet purification, energy and comfort requirements. At the manufacturer-recommended air supply speed of the purification equipment (0.86 m/s), the concentration of pollutants in the area surrounding the patient's head was higher, and the concentration of pollutants in most areas of the room was lower than the levels detected at other air supply speeds. We also investigated the isolation effect of the PI bed on cigarette particles, S. albus and viruses in the laboratory. The test results showed that the PI bed successfully isolated the above pollutants and pathogens. It effectively reduced the concentration of various particles and pathogens in the room, while simultaneously blocking the spread of pollutants and pathogens into the room. It can carry out disinfection, sterilization and air purification in a timely manner to successfully protect patients, family members and medical staff from the risk of cross infection or even NI. One study has proposed a definition of aerosols and standards for dividing particle size (Tellier et al. 2019 ). Among them, small particles of < 5-10 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter that follow airflow streamlines are potentially capable of short and long range transmission; particles of < 5 \u03bcm are more likely to pass through the airway to reach the alveolar space (Tellier et al. 2019) . Small droplets may be involved in shortdistance transmission, but compared with large droplets, these can more easily evaporate and form droplet nuclei, which have the potential for long-distance air transmission, and so can be directly inhaled by susceptible people to cause infection (Tang et al. 2006) .",

Third, the aerosol generator did not produce uniform aerosols, and so we will investigate other brands for further tests. In addition, we only used smoke particulates, S. albus, and viruses to simulate the isolation of patient droplets, which may not be fully reflective of real-world scenarios. Finally, we did not truly test the isolation of patient droplets and the protection of medical personnel. Related experiments have been planned as our next step research.
