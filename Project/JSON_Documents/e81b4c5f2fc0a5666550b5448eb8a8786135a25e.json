Genomic sequence analyses have exhibited a high resemblance among SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses circulating in bat populations (Ji et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , although the exact source of the virus remains uncertain. Intermediate animal host species are also being evaluated, including livestock and pangolins (Lam et al., 2020) , the latter of which are critically endangered, in part, due to overconsumption in China. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global society and economy and demonstrated the colossal cost of wildlife consumption. It also created a strong incentive for the government to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases by regulating consumption, trade, and trafficking of wildlife products.",

The February 2020 ban by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress completely prohibits the farming, hunting, selling, purchasing, and trafficking of species classified as terrestrial wild animals for food consumption. It covers not just wild-caught species that are recognized nationally and internationally as endangered species, but also applies to animals born and raised in breeding facilities such as Chinese bamboo rat (Rhizomys sinensis) and Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyura). The new ban does not include aquatic species and it does not affect other uses of wildlife, such as medicine, clothing, decorations, or pet trade. This ban is legally binding and took effect immediately at all levels of government during the period while the WPL is being revised and finalized. In the meantime, the most recent draft of WPL pending public comments includes an additional 100 and 300 species in its first-class and second-class protection lists respectively, more than doubling the total number of species listed in the current version of the law.",

Severe penalties are imposed for hunting, purchasing, trafficking, and selling even a small quantity of first-class protection species (the number of animals involved in the crime is used to measure severity of the punishment and varies based on species). For the second-class protection species, the number of animals that need to be involved in the crime to warrant a severe penalty is higher. For species on the Sanyou list, local governments (province/ autonomous region/direct-administered municipality) are responsible for defining the degree and extent of protection (season and location for hunting bans) and the severity of punishment for different violations.

The existing WPL also has many ambiguous categories where wildlife can still be utilized for commercial use such as consumption of fur, traditional medicine, and captive breeding, even for some species included in the first-class and second-class lists. For example, bear farms harvesting bile from caged live animals are legal. While an estimated 10,000 bears are kept in bile farms (Crudge et al., 2020) , the government-sanctioned bear farms and utilization of bear bile fuels illegal trafficking of wildcaught black bears to bear farms; it also creates a way for poached bear products to enter the market, disguised as farmed bear products (Foley et al., 2011; Nijman et al., 2017) . The situation is similar to the pangolin, a species suspected to be a potential intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020) . Despite being afforded international CITES Level I protection status and listed as a national first-class protected species, pangolin scales are commonly sold as ingredients for traditional medicine.",

The implicit belief is that wildlife exists as a natural resource to be exploited by humans to create values (Zhang et al., 2008) . The emphasis on the potential economic return from the use of wildlife has made domestic enforcement of the law complicated, as it has allowed multiple exceptions and loopholes through which one can utilize and commercialize wildlife products, as long as it is not explicitly prohibited. The exemptions have also undermined China's ability to fulfill its obligation to International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora in curbing global trade of endangered species; the immense size and diversity of demand in the Chinese market is a driving factor for wildlife poaching and trafficking in neighboring countries and around the globe (Challender and MacMillan, 2014; Nijman et al., 2017) .",

The inconsistency between species' status on China's Protected Species List and their extinction risk set by international conventions such as CITES and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) can pose a serious threat to species with rapidly declining populations, often making the legislation and enforcement one step behind. The previous revision of the law has made progress by giving CITES-listed species the legal status of the domestic List of Protected Species for enforcement and prosecution purposes. For example, for the wildlife on the CITES Level I and Level II projection lists with foreign origin are managed as the firstclass and second-classes protection species respectively. Even for species with both domestic and foreign distribution, such classification based on geographic origin can easily designate appropriate legal status. For aquatic animals, in theory, the CITES Level I protected species are managed as first-class protected species. The CITES Level II, Level III, and the domesticated and captive bred Level I species and their products are managed as second-class protected species. However, because there is no judgement of geographic origin and there are fewer aquatic species explicitly protected by the WPL (the Sanyou list does not include aquatic species at all), there is a greater ambiguity when enforcing the protection of CITES listed aquatic wildlife, particularly the ones not listed on WPL lists.",

When civets were implicated for SARS, a temporary ban stopped their consumption for food, but the strict ban was lifted a couple of months later when no further infections were detected (Liu, 2003) . Although the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far more severe and persistent than that of SARS, it remains to be seen whether this time the government agencies will stay committed to enforcing the wildlife consumption bans, specifically through patrolling, investigating, and penalizing businesses and individuals engaged in illegal activities. Without enforcement, much of the activities will continue; sustaining these efforts will be the key to the long-term success of the new policies. Strong enforcement is particularly needed when the economic impact of COVID-19 is still felt by local communities. The rural and indigenous communities are more likely to resort to natural resource extraction and wildlife-related shadow economy when other job options are exhausted (McNamara et al., 2020; Roe et al., 2020) .",

The specification of the ban creates a potential loophole that can be exploited, particularly since there is a relatively blurred line between medicine and food in China. In 2019, two species of pangolin (Manis javanica, Manis crassicaudata) were upgraded to the same level as the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), now having a first-class protection status on the Chinese Protected Species List. However, given the widespread demand for pangolin scales for Chinese traditional medicine, large quantities of pangolin scales continue to be available in markets and are imported internationally as medical ingredients (TRAFFIC, 2015) ; the upgraded protection status and the new ban on food consumption will likely have limited impact on mitigating the dire situation of the pangolin. Under such circumstances, the list of protected species must be updated regularly to meet the conservation need , and the consumption of endangered or threatened wildlife for medicine should be banned without any exception.",

The practices for wildlife consumption and the use of traditional medicine have been ingrained in the Chinese culture for thousands of years. Notably, dependency on wildlife products had/has been prevalent in many cultures, and is not unique to China. However, given the large population and the purchasing power of China, the consumption, if left unchecked, will have dire consequences for domestic and global conservation. A quick ban would likely force the trade underground and make the problem of enforcement even more difficult. To be effective in the long-term, enforcement must be paired with community education on the risks of wildlife consumption and the value of biodiversity, and provisions for alternative resources for those who depend on traditional medicine for their livelihoods. Public campaigns and long-term integration into every level of society is essential for the law to be successful. A promising example is that residents of Beijing and Shanghai have shown significantly stronger support for wildlife protection compared with other Chinese cities. This was associated with continuous public awareness education campaigns led by various governmental agencies and civil societies (Zhang and Yin, 2014) . During the campaign to combat the COVID-19 crisis, the neighborhood level government infrastructure (neighborhood committees) proved effective in relaying information, educating and monitoring exceptionally large numbers of people. These committees should be mobilized to become a key component of the future outreach campaigns and are well suited for tasks such as educating residents, monitoring of markets, and liaising with law enforcement.",

A revised Chinese Pharmacopoeia was partially released in June 2020. Pangolin scale is no longer listed in the new version, along with a traditional patent medicine that contains bat guano (National Pharmacopoeia Commettee, 2020). However, the removal of an ingredient from the Pharmacopoeia does not equate to banning its use, unless the China Food and Drug Administration issues an administrative notice to explicitly state its prohibition. In the past, such notices have been issued to stop the use of rhino (Rhinocerotidae spp.) horn, tiger (Panthera tigris) bone, and leopard (Panthera pardus) bone products. Until an official ban is issued, the retail and the pharmaceutical production of traditional patent medicine that contains pangolin scales will continue to be legal. Different sections of Pharmacopoeia (e.g., ingredient, and potent formula) are not consistent on the use of pangolin scale. As a result, even though pangolin scale as an ingredient is delisted, many of the traditional patent medicines using pangolin scales are still listed as formulas in the 2020 version of the Pharmacopoeia (National Pharmacopoeia Commettee, 2020). More importantly, bear bile and other wildlife products are still listed as ingredients in the revised Pharmacopoeia. For wildlife species not directly associated with COVID-19, which created widespread public outrage and scrutiny on pangolin and bat consumption, it is not clear when the protection from Chinese medicine consumers and manufacturers will be extended to them. The Pharmacopoeia should be based on sound science in order to avoid major deficiencies in its quality, safety, effectiveness, health benefits, and its environmental impact.",

Achieving such goals can have long-term societal impacts on sustainability and public welfare, including creating eco-friendly local livelihoods, reducing environmental pollution, flood and soil erosion control, and producing many other positive results, including reduced risk of zoonotic diseases. However, it is still not clear which mechanisms designed to strengthen habitat conservation will be in the revised WPL. In many places, habitat encroachment goes hand in hand with wildlife poaching. It is only possible to sustain biodiversity by simultaneously stopping wildlife consumption while promoting initiatives and awareness in biodiversity and habitat conservation.

Though it is widely believed to be farmed and consumed at a sustainable level, many of the frog farms with a \"free ranging\" method can cause externalized damage to regional biodiversity. Frog farmers typically set up expansive enclosures in the forest, release tens of thousands of subadult frogs per enclosure, and remove predators such as snakes and rodents. Although such practices are claimed to have successfully maintained the overall population of Asiatic grass frogs, their negative impacts on the overall biodiversity have been consistently overlooked. The State Forestry and Grassland Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice in May 2020 clarifying that Asiatic grass frogs are considered aquatic animals, and therefore its farming and consumption are exempted from the newly issued ban on terrestrial wildlife.",

There are more than 31,500 terrestrial bird, mammal, amphibian, and reptile species traded globally (Scheffers et al., 2019) . Hotspots of those traded wildlife species are mostly in tropical regions such as southeast Asia and eastern Africa, which highly overlap with the countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The newly enacted decision and up-and-coming revision of the WPL have the potential to be a powerful tools for limiting future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases directly through the minimization of human and wild animal interfaces. However, as China's population continues to grow, and if the demand for wildlife products is unchecked, high-risk exposures to wildlife will be challenging to control. Halting wildlife trafficking, redesigning the focus of wet markets, and reducing consumer demand through new legislative and executive actions can be a significant step in the right direction for reducing human-wildlife interfaces and the risk of future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.
