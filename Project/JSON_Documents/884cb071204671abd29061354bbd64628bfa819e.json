In this study, we apply a deep learning approach to extract eligibility criteria variables from COVID-19 trials to enable quantitative analysis of trial design and optimization. Specifically, we train attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Att-BiLSTM) models and use the optimal model to extract entities (i.e., variables) from the eligibility criteria of COVID-19 trials. We compare the performance of Att-BiLSTM with traditional ontology-based method. The result on a benchmark dataset shows that Att-BiLSTM outperforms the ontology model. Att-BiLSTM achieves a precision of 0.942, recall of 0.810, and F1 of 0.871, while the ontology model only achieves a precision of 0.715, recall of 0.659, and F1 of 0.686. Our analyses demonstrate that Att-BiLSTM is an effective approach for characterizing patient populations in COVID-19 clinical trials.",

Rule-based NER strongly relies on the terms and their interrelations defined in the ontology. It cannot identify new terms or entities. Machine learning methods can address the offdictionary issue by learning from the way various concepts are used in written medical or life science language. For example, Kang et al. [13] annotated eligibility criteria from 230 Alzheimer's clinical trials to train conditional random field (CRF) models for entity recognition.

The multiply attention method achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 92.87, while the dot attention method achieves the worst performance with an accuracy of 92.52. BiLSTM without attention achieves an accuracy of 92.55. This shows the impact of attention methods on the BiLSTM model performance.",
