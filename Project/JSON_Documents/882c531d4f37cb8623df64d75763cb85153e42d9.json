Few studies have examined the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association of frailty with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Methods Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystectomy were identified from 2005 to 2010 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). The Modified Frailty Index (mFI) was used a surrogate for frailty, and patients were stratified as non-frail (mFI 0), low frailty (mFI 1-2), intermediate frailty (mFI 3-4) and high frailty (mFI \u2265 5). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine accuracy of mFI in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality. Results Of the 6898 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3245 (47%) patients were non-frail. There were 2913 (42%) patients with low-frailty, 649 (9%) patients with intermediate frailty, and 91 (2%) with high frailty. Clavien IV complications were higher for intermediate frail patients (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.00-3.28, p = 0.050) and high-frail patients (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.98-10.7, p < 0.001). Additionally, mortality was higher for patients with intermediate frailty (OR 4 .69, 95% CI 1.37-16.0, p = 0.014) and high frailty (OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.67-55.5, p = 0.001).

Studying individual frailty components is important to generate procedure-specific variables that may be utilized in future frailty scoring systems. The application of mFI using the NSQIP database has allowed for the use of a prognostic model to a heterogeneous population for a single disease process to measure clinical outcomes. Frailty is a marker for the sum of overall physiologic status and a useful tool to determine the risk of postoperative complications. Multiple models exist for calculating frailty, including the Frailty Index of Cumulative Deficits, Fried's Frailty Phenotype, and the Frailty Index of Accumulative Deficit. 20 These models have been noted to have limitations as they are burdened by either increasing complexity or too simplistic which translates to limited predictability. Despite the increasing variety of frailty models, there is no universally accepted frailty definition or components. However, the mFI strikes a reasonable balance and has demonstrated clinical utility in colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic, vascular, and gynecologic surgery. 15, [21] [22] [23] Recently, Murphy and colleagues have studied the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing various emergency general surgical procedures using mFI. 11 In their analysis, 14% of patients underwent a cholecystectomy, and high frail patients were more likely to suffer a serious complications (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-6.3) and were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.33).
