COVID-19 is a severe and potentially fatal infectious disease that can be spread by asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic carriers [3, 4] . As of 3rd March 2021, over 115 million people worldwide [5] have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, threatening human health and public safety. Even though a large portion of COVID-19 patients remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, the infection causes serious complications in susceptible individuals [6] . COVID-19 disease is characterized by complications including endothelial barrier disruption, dysfunctional alveolar-capillary oxygen transmission, and impaired oxygen diffusion capacity [7] . In critical symptomatic cases, life threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the main cause of death [8] [9] [10] . SARS-CoV-2 mediated endothelial tissue injury is believed",

The system maintains virucidal levels of sanitizing gas while cycling internal pressures between \u221230 kPa and \u221215 kPa, which permeates ozone throughout the chamber while ensuring none of it escapes during the sanitization cycle. Once the vacuum seal is generated, ozone (O 3 ) is produced by the device at point-of-use using electricity and atmospheric air, through cleavage of O 2 into elemental oxygen (which combines with molecular oxygen (O 2 ) to create transient O 3 ) via a corona discharge device. The system then back-fills the evacuated chamber with air while an onboard microcontroller attempts to maintain target ozone concentration levels (20 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm). At all times, the contents of the chamber are being held under negative pressure with the only exit for all gases in the system being pumped through the MnO 2 -CuO 2 -O 3 scrubber to ensure environmentally safe device exhaust within OSHA and FDA guidelines. The FATHHOME device can be operated through its onboard microcontroller, which is accessed either via a switch located on the device or via a cloud-based web-panel. For the duration of this study, the FATHHOME device was kept inside BSL-2+ containment and controlled remotely outside the test room for each disinfection cycle.",

The FD-600-O3 features a built-in extraction pump that allows it to detect 0-100 ppm ozone with 0.1 ppm resolution under both atmospheric and vacuum pressure conditions.

After each disinfection cycle, the mocktreated and ozone-treated viruses were recovered by adding 500 \u00b5L of culture medium on the surfaces and allowing it to resuspend, for 15 min at 34 \u2022 C. For viruses applied to porous N95 FFRs, where the virus could be absorbed into multiple layers, any remaining virus was recovered by incubating the treated material with 500 \u00b5L of culture medium for 15 min at 34 \u2022 C, followed by centrifugation at 12 K rpm for 5 min, and removal of N95 FFR material. The recovered viruses were collected in a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube either for further extraction of total viral RNA with Trizol reagent for viral genome quantitation using qRT-PCR or applied onto a permissive A549-hACE2 HA-FLAG cell monolayer for the detection of residual infectious virus through integrated cell culture PCR and localization of infected cells through immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 1 ). The A549-hACE2 (HA-FLAG) cells are a human lung carcinoma (A549) cell line over-expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2) under control of the XYZ promoter. Each assay was done in duplicates and each experiment was conducted three independent times.",

Lack of any signals in control (uninfected cells) and specific localization of nucleocapsid signals confirmed the specificity of our assay ( Figure 2C ).

In an attempt to test the disinfection efficiency of FATHHOME on HCoVs, HCoV-OC43 was used as a surrogate of the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 for practical reasons. Given the high genomic sequence similarities between betacoronavirus family members, human cell entry and infection mechanisms as well as inactivation conditions are likely to be similar [51] . In this study, we tested the virus decontamination on two different surfaces, i.e., a nonporous smooth surface (glass coverslips) and a porous, soft surface (N95 FFRs). HCoV-OC43 virus suspensions (10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5L liquid droplets) were applied onto each surface and placed inside a 12-well plate. The plate containing HCoV-OC43 viruses was exposed, after removing the lid, to an ozone concentration of approximately 20 ppm and an ambient pressure of 68 kPa to 85 kPa produced by the FATHHOME device, situated inside a BSL-2+ containment for 10 min ( Figure 3A ). Glass coverslips and N95 FFRs containing the same amount of virus without ozone treatment were used as a control in our assay. Untreated and ozone-treated viruses were collected for the evaluation of virus inactivation by direct genomic RNA quantitation (qRT-PCR) and infectivity assay using permissive A549-hACE2 cells. Presence of the viral genomic RNA was determined using qRT-PCR as used earlier for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental surface and air samples [17] . Detection of genomic viral RNA through qRT-PCR is considered to be a highly sensitive method for the detection of viral genomic RNA, however a positive result does not necessarily mean that viral genomic RNA is intact or that the RNA is inside an infectious virus. However, absence of a virus specific PCR signal confirms absolute removal of virus and viral genome. Therefore, viral genomic RNA quantitation along with infectivity assays was devised for estimating viral inactivation efficacies. HCoV-OC43 viral copies in the ozone treated and untreated samples were calculated based on the standard curve generated using serial dilutions of known HCoV-OC43 genomic RNA ( Figure 2 ). The intact residual virus copies in ozone-treated samples were calculated and compared to the untreated controls, set to 100%. As expected, the copies of viral genomic RNA declined (i.e., one log 10 decrease) after 10 min, 20 ppm ozone-exposure on both the tested surfaces Figure 3B ). Interestingly, we saw a slightly higher reduction (98.14%) in the viral genomic RNA on N95 FFRs than glass coverslips (90.71%) in this assay ( Figure 3B ). ",

Quantitation of intracellular HCoV-OC43 genome copies through spike glycoprotein gene specific qRT-PCR led to the calculation of infectious virus added onto the target cells as described in Figure 2B . Calculated residual live virus copies based on the intracellular viral genomic copies, showed that ozone effectively reduced the amounts of infectious virus when compared with the control, non-ozone treated samples. Noticeably, there was a higher, 99.49% reduction ( Figure 3C ), in infectious virus on smooth surface than from soft surface (96.78% reduction). These observed differences could be attributed to surface composition variability, which affects virus adsorption and infectivity. Additionally, presence of live virus was detected by localizing the viral nucleocapsid protein through immunofluorescence staining for HCoV-OC43 viral protein ( Figure 3D ). Figure 3D , the addition of ozone-exposed HCoV-OC43 virus resulted in a reduction of the virus-positive cells, compared to the untreated controls where 95% of cells were positive for HCoV-OC43 protein.

Estimation of residual infectious viral copies for 25 ppm-10 min ozone treatment, through qRT-PCR confirmed lower copies of the infectious virus (three log 10 reduction) were recovered from smooth surface as compared to virus recovered from soft surface (one log 10 reduction, Figure 4C ). Further, the HCoV-OC43 virus had been completely degraded (below the detection limit) on both the surfaces after 15-and 20-min exposure of 25 ppm ozone.

The results from the infectivity assay, detecting HCoV-OC43 infected cells, with ozone-treated and untreated virus correlated well with the qRT-PCR results ( Figure 4D ). Absence of any HCoV-OC43 protein stained A549-hACE2-cells, as compared to untreated control virus, further confirmed complete HCoV-OC43 inactivation 10, 15, and 20 min after 25 ppm-ozone treatment on smooth surface. Although we detected 1.6% HCoV-OC43 protein positive cells (8 positive cells out of 500 cells examined) in virus recovered from N95 mask exposed 10 min after 25 ppm exposure, an increase in the ozone exposure time to 15 min completely abrogated infectious virus copies ( Figure 4D ). As expected, no residual live virus could be detected 20 min after 25 ppm ozone exposure ( Figure 4D ). hACE2-cells, as compared to untreated control virus, further confirmed complete HCoV-OC43 inactivation 10, 15, and 20 min after 25 ppm-ozone treatment on smooth surface.

To this end, the same amounts of HCoV-OC43 coronavirus were applied onto coverslips and N95 FFRs placed inside the wells of a 12-well plate and exposed to 50 ppm ozone gas and an ambient pressure of 68 kPa to 85 kPa for 10, 15, and 20 min ( Figure 5A ). Total RNA was extracted to quantify the intact genomic HCoV-OC43 RNA copies through qRT-PCR, as described above. As expected, prolonged exposure of the surfaces to 50 ppm ozone disintegrated 99.9% of virus genomic RNA (3-fold reduction) within 10 min of exposure, on both the tested surfaces ( Figure 5B ). Increasing the exposure time to 15 min did not further reduce the viral copy load detected on glass surfaces or N95 FFRs. Further increasing the exposure time to 20 min at 50 ppm ozone, resulted in no residual intact viral genomic copies detected on either glass surfaces or N95 FFRs. The recovered viruses from both the surfaces were subsequently assayed for virus infectivity using A549-ACE2 cells, and the results are shown in Figure 5C . The qRT-PCR analysis for residual live virus quantification, showed a complete disintegration of the viral genome (below the detection limit), present on both the tested surfaces, regardless of the exposure time ( Figure 5C ). The virus infectivity was also analyzed using IFA ( Figure 5D ). No residual infectious virus was detected in the virus culture assays for all the selected time points. Thus, the FATHHOME device can safely operate under OSHA and FDA ozone emissions limits at an internal ozone concentration of 50 ppm leading to 100% inactivation of HCoV-OC43 virus within 10 min. .

These epidemics/pandemics include Spanish influenza (1918), Asian influenza (1957) [53, 54] . Interestingly, the airborne transmission of respiratory viruses through direct or indirect contact or even without contact over a distance contributes to the associated respiratory infections being ubiquitous [55] . The widespread dissemination and survival of respiratory viruses on infected surfaces or individualized items, and the severity of infection, highlight the need of reviewing available as well as establishing newer decontamination approaches to control the spread of infections. Although masks, personal protective equipment, distancing, and disinfecting appear effective in controlling exposure to infections, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and potential future epidemics call for the development of new viral deactivation technologies to help control the virus spread. Thus, an urgent need remains to develop and validate virus deactivation technologies to provide rapid, effective, and safe decontamination solutions. Hence, in this study, we validated the surface inactivation of human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, a less-pathogenic model of SARS-CoV-2, using FATHHOME's high-volume, eco-friendly, ozone-based dry sanitizing system.",

Ozone is created via dissociation of oxygen molecules into atomic oxygen, which then quickly combines with other oxygen molecules to form ozone [57] . Ozone is an effective disinfectant against bacteria [58, 59] and viruses [60, 61] including enveloped HCoVs [62] [63] [64] [65] . A study on efficacy of ozone solution disinfectant in inactivating SARS-CoV has shown a high dose of ozone (27.73 mg/L) could kill the virus in 4 min [66] . Anti-microbial activity of ozone towards virus inactivation of surfaces has also been demonstrated using bacteriophages \u03c6X174, MS2, \u03c66 and T7, as surrogates of mammalian viruses [62] , and nosocomial bacterial pathogens including Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus [67] . Although the mechanism of anti-viral activity of ozone is yet to be fully understood, ozone deactivates virus through both the direct (ozone) and/or indirect (generation of reactive oxygen species/ROS) reaction mechanisms [68] . The viral proteins of HCoVs are susceptible to oxidative damage by ozone due to the presence of oxidation-prone amino acids (tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine due to sulfhydryl residues, R-S-H), and the fatty acids (arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid due to unsaturated bonds) alterations, which affect the viral protein's structure, biochemical activity and virus growth properties. Fragmentation of viral proteins allows ozone to attack and damage viral nucleic acid making it non-infectious [69] . Due to its excellent oxidizing properties, aqueous ozone has been extensively used to disinfect water, purify air, and preserve food [70] , however the use of ozone gas on a commercial level still needs to be explored. Ozone in its gaseous state allows better penetration and inactivation of contaminated surfaces (both porous and nonporous) more effectively than liquid disinfectants.",

Recently, Dubuis et al. have demonstrated that maximum anti-viral efficacy of ozone against airborne viruses requires a low dose of the ozone gas exposure combined with a high relative humidity [64] . In another study, aimed to design a mobile ozone generator for deactivating viruses, 20-25 ppm ozone coupled with >90% relative humidity was found effective in achieving at least three log 10 virus reduction in all 12 tested viruses [71] . In both studies, the effect of the increased relative humidity was studied and shown to augment the virucidal properties of ozone. In our study, we have demonstrated that HCoV-OC43 is susceptible to oxidative damage by ozone. An interesting finding is that using FATHHOME's device 20-25 ppm ozone exposure for 10-15 min, can completely eliminate HCoV-OC43 virus on both coverslips and N95 FFRs (more than 6 log 10 reduction) even at ambient relative humidity (45%). Since FATHHOME can maintain ozone's antiviral efficacy in a typical air-conditioned environment (25 \u2022 C and 45% relative humidity), it may find important and broader practical applications.",

            "text": "Surgical masks and N95 FFRs prevent workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in essential healthcare and non-healthcare settings [43] . Concerned by the pandemic potential of COVID-19, use of face masks, surgical masks (to filter infectious particles spreading via droplets), and N95 FFRs (to filter at least 95% of particulates), became mandatory in nearly all COVID-19 affected countries. A rise in the global demand has resulted in a shortage of disposable surgical masks and N95 FFRs. Consequently, reuse of single-use disposable masks has been implemented. There is no standard decontamination protocol for safe decontamination and reprocessing of the masks, although UVGI, moist heat, microwave-generated steam, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the current standard for N95 decontamination [33, 37, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Since all these methods have advantages and disadvantages, a careful consideration of the type of respirator and biological target has to be performed, to restore the fit and filtration capacity of the N95 respirator post decontamination. In this regard, several recent reports have evaluated the effect of ozone treatment on the filtration performance of N95 respirators [46, [72] [73] [74] . Interestingly, neither higher ozone concentration (200 ppm for 90 min) nor prolonged ozone exposure (20 ppm for 36 h) appear to degrade or damage the filtration efficiency of N95 FFRs, illustrating the effectiveness of ozone treatment for contaminated FFRs regeneration [74] . FATHHOME's dry sanitizing technology can quickly and gently sanitize articles not compatible with traditional chemical-based disinfectants, \"wet\" sanitization methods, or methods involving heat and pressure. Such technology is particularly relevant to frontline workers outside the hospital setting (smaller medical/dental offices, EMS, fire and police stations, home care nurses, staff at long term care homes, retail workers, the food and hospitality industry) that produce significant amounts of daily medical and PPE waste to keep their workforce safe, but do not have access to expensive industrial-scale sanitization systems. In addition, workers are now faced with \"decontamination fatigue\" as time-consuming (and often ineffective) decontamination tasks, which they thought were temporary, have now become part of daily routines.",

Major concerns during the regeneration of N95 FFRs include effective inactivation of the targeted pathogens and maintenance of the FFRs filtration performance.
