Also, here we used plasma and the test was performed in a laboratory environment; we may 246 expect different results in real-life at patients' bed and using capillary blood.

It is widely accepted that IgM provide the first line of 63 defense during viral infections, prior to the generation of adaptive, high affinity IgG responses that are 64 important for long term immunity and immunological memory (Li et al. 2020b). Several authors 65 analyzed the antibody kinetics in COVID-19 patients. Zhao et al. (2020) showed that among 173 66 patients, the seroconversion sequentially appeared for total antibody, IgM and then IgG, with a median 67 time of 11, 12 and 14 days after symptom onset. The majority of antibodies are produced against the 68 most abundant protein of the virus, which is the Nucleocapsid protein (NP). Therefore, serological tests 69 that detect antibodies to NP should be the most sensitive. In addition, because the receptor-binding 70 domain of the Spike protein (RBD-S) is the host attachment protein, antibodies against RBD-S should 71 be very specific. Therefore, according to some authors, using one or both antigens should result in high 72 sensitivity and specificity (Sethuraman et al. 2020). The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Simtomax\u00ae 73 CoronaCheck developed by Augurix SA (Switzerland) uses both antigens as described in To et al.",

Diagnostic performance in low prevalence populations still 211 needs to be experimentally determined and it would be interesting to validate the results on larger212 populations. The results of our study on plasma samples are similar with those recently published on 213 whole blood and plasma samples, which indicated a sensitivity of Augurix RDT between 93% and 100% 214 for samples with a DPS of >15 days. By contrast, our results differ from prior studies using Augurix and 215 other RDTs that observed a lower sensitivity of 56.4% for a DPS of > 21 days (Rudolf et al. 2020). A 216 first difference between the present study and the one of Rudolf et al. (2020) is that positive samples 217 were assessed here when either the IgM or the IgG band was positive, while in Rudolf et al, the results 218 were separated for the two lines, i.e. they assessed sensitivity for either the IgM or the IgG line. A second 219 possible partial explanation for the discrepancy is that the study by Rudolf et al included a large panel 220 of samples corresponding to varying severities of the symptoms. As this information is not available for 221 the plasma samples analyzed in our study, it is possible that they were collected from patients showing 222 more severe forms of COVID-19. On the other hand, the antibody titers in the plasma samples as 223 determined by ECLIA spanned a large range of concentration, which points towards the fact that the 224 samples in our study corresponded to various severities of COVID-19. A more comprehensive study on 225 a larger panel of well-defined sample might clarify these discrepancies. Concerning the specificity of 226 the test, the excellent performance observed in this study is in line with the results of preceding 227 publications (Andrey et al. 2020; Coste et al. 2020). Three control blood sample turned out to be IgM 228 positive by RDT. These samples were collected before 2018 and it seems that a cross-reaction with the 229 IgM line occurred leading to a false positive result.
