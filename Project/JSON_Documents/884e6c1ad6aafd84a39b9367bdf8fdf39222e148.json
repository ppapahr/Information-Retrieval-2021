HPLC grade water was obtained from a water purifying system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). 2,2\u2032-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, purity \u2265 98%), potassium persulphate (purity \u2265 99 %) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), and Trolox (purity \u2265 98%) from Fluka Chemika (Buchs, Switzerland). The compounds separation was carried out utilizing an ACE C18 column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5.0 \u03bcm, Pennsylvania, USA) with a YMC guard cartridge ODS-A (3.0 \u03bcm, 10 mm \u00d7 4.0 mm). The binary solvent system of the mobile phase comprised solvent A (0.1% acetic acid in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). A following linear gradient program was applied: 0-8 min, 5-15% B; 8-30 min, 15-20% B; 30-48 min, 20-40% B; 48-58 min, 40-50% B; 58-65 min, 50%; 65-66 min, 50-95% B. The injection volume of the sample solution was 20 \u03bcL. After PDA detection, the ABTS solution was mixed with the mobile phase carrying the analytes in the reaction coil (Raudonis et al., 2009; Raudonis et al., 2012) . Empower Software Chromatographic Manager System (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) was used to analyze the data. The ABTS post-column chromatograms were detected at the wavelength of 650 nm using Waters 2487 UV/VIS detector (Waters Corporation). The standard antioxidant Trolox (0.3995 \u00b5mol/g) was used for the preparation of the calibration curves (Marksa et al., 2016) . Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was used to express antioxidant activity. The value was calculated as \u03bcmol Trolox equivalent (TE) for 1 g of dry mass (DM) of the plant material using the following formula: TEAC = c \u00d7 V/m (\u03bcmol/g) where 'c' is the Trolox concentration in \u03bcM established from the calibration curve, 'V' is the plant material extract volume in L, and 'm' is the weight (precise) in g.",

The reporter cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), and 100 \u03bcg/mL hygromycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Reporter cells were seeded (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) in 96-wells plate, then were treated with the indicated concentration of the sample for 18 h (single measurement). Resazurin (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) with a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. Fluorescence of the reduced resazurin in the supernatant of the cell (ex/em: 530 nm/590 nm) was detected using a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) to determine cell viability. The cells were then harvested and luciferase activity measurements were achieved according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The luciferase activity was normalized to cell viability and the relative luciferase activity was calculated and compared with the control (DMSO).",

After 1 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 \u03bcL of stop buffer (0.1 M Na2/NaHCO3, pH 10.0). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a microplate reader. The inhibition percentage of \u03b2-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells was calculated as the percentage of the control value (untreated stimulated cells) using the following equation: 3.15.
