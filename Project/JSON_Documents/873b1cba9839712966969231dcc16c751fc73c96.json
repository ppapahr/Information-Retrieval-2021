Methods The 21 first patients (14 men and 7 women) who recovered from ARDS in context of COVID-19 were referred to VFS just before to maximum 14 days after their discharge from ICU. The swallowing impairments and the physiopathologic mechanism of them were prospectively analyzed by two swallowing experts: one radiologist, and one phoniatrician using penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) score. Results Nineteen out of 21 presented impairment in their swallowing function. Sixteen patients presented direct penetration or inhalation. All but one were silent. Some stases were also observed in 13 patients. Five patients presented secondary penetration/aspiration, among these inhalations, and all were silent. The most frequent findings are the delayed pharyngeal phase, the reduced propulsion of the tongue root, the posterior oral leaks, the default of laryngeal closure, and the impaired pharyngeal peristaltism. Discussion The very high prevalence of swallowing disorders with inhalation and the lack of protective reflexes are the main findings. This emphasizes the need of high caution with bedside screening in these patients with severely injured lungs.",

The question of the intensive care unit availabilities has been critical due to the possible occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 8-29% of patients [1] . In the 5% most severe cases, respiratory support could include mechanical ventilation [1] through oro-tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Post-extubation dysphagia is reported in more than 40% of patients in intensive care units independently from their pathology [2] . In COVID-19 patients where the lungs are severely injured, it is especially critical to identify dysphagic patients [3] . At the same time, several recommendations on the dysphagia assessment have been published to reduce the exposition and contamination of the healthcare workers. All recommendations proposed to post-pone pharyngo-laryngeal fiberscopy [4] , and thus fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing [5] . The videofluoroscopy of swallowing appeared as a safer process with less exposure to virus, and presents a high reliability in the detection of aspiration [5] .",

This is a retrospective study, consistent with the current ethical laws in Belgium, of the clinical procedure adopted in the COVID-19 context. Videofluoroscopy: all patients were examined in seated position. After blank X-rays, the procedure included fluoroscopy registrations (less irradiating) in face and profile incidences. The profile incidence was used to assess the swallowing function. The swallowing tests include swallowing of barium with several levels of thicknesses [6] : IDDSI 2 first for the analysis of the mechanisms of swallowing, IDDSI 0 to increase the sensibility to aspiration, and IDDSI 5 (soft cake in barium) to increase the sensibility to stases. All VFS were analyzed by a laryngologist specialized in swallowing disorders and a radiologist specialized in VFS, the results provided were a consensus between them. If some impairment is highlighted with a bolus, it is considered as impaired. The penetration-aspiration scale (PAS score) [7] , and qualitative assessment of stases location, and of the mechanisms of swallowing were performed.",

On the contrary, all the patients were fed with a nasogastric tube, with the risk of gastroesophageal reflux. The history of extubation failure with re-intubation and the duration of oro-tracheal intubation are significantly associated with dysphagia [11] and this duration was very high in our population. It is likely that the ventral position also increased the oropharyngeal and laryngeal trauma. The high duration of sedation also increased the risk of neuromuscular weakness with impaired lingual and/or pharyngeal propulsion of the bolus and stases. The sensibility of the upper respiratory tract was probably reduced, explaining the most frequent findings of VFS with both delayed pharyngeal phase of swallowing and lack of protective reflexes, despite the delay from extubation > 7 days. This may be due to direct neurological pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV2, but it is hypothetic and this study does not allow to ascertain it. The virus is known to be neurotropic and some authors hypothesized that it could retrogradely travel from the vagus endpoints in the infected organs to the solitary tract in the brainstem, which is very important for the sensibility of the pharynx and the larynx [12] . Some others emphasized that all the swallowing network including cortical, subcortical and brainstem structures as well as peripheral nerves and muscles may be targeted by the virus [13] .",

The first one is that it is descriptive and based on a retrospective design as the VFS was performed in the clinical management of the patients and not in a prospective way. Nevertheless, facing to the emerging pathology, we decided to prospectively collect the data when the VFS was performed. Due to this method, there may be some bias in the recruitment of the patients. The number of patient is not very high but the profiles of the patients are quite homogeneous and so are the VFS findings. The other weakness is the lack of control group which prevent to consider COVID-19 patients as different from patient with as long ICU stay with oro-tracheal intubation, but the constitution of this group may be problematic: other patient undergo tracheostomy earlier, and their own pathology may importantly impact the swallowing function.",

Due to their reduced lung function, aspiration can worsen their clinical situation. It is necessary to be very cautious with the bedside dysphagia screening, keeping in mind that its sensibility to silent aspiration is limited and that its quality is decreased by the protective measures in epidemic context. It seems better to delay the screening and to propose VFS when the patient is able to undergo it.",
