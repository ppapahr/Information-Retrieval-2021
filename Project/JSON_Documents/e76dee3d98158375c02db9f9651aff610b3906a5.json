Recent guidelines have delineated how best to diagnose and manage patients with PE. However, the unique aspects of this virus confound both the diagnosis and treatment of PE, and thus require modification of established algorithms. 1-6 Important considerations include adjustment of diagnostic modalities, incorporation of the pro-thrombotic contribution of COVID-19, management of two critical cardio-respiratory illnesses in the same patient, and protecting patients and health care workers while providing optimal care. The benefits of a team-based approach for decision-making and coordination of care, such as that offered by pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT), has become more evident in this crisis. The importance of careful followup care also is underscored for patients with these two diseases with long-term effects.

Clinical assessment of stability is critical and should be based on objective measures including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen requirements, assessment of RV function over time, and overall clinical trajectory, so as to avoid unnecessary resource utilization and to minimize unnecessary exposures. Furthermore, systemic anticoagulation, in the context of worsening right ventricular dysfunction, may be an acceptable lone therapy if either a patient declines an additional procedural intervention or contraindications are present for which a procedural intervention carries more risk than benefit.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWhen an intervention is deemed necessary, rapid mobilization of resources, as can often be performed by PERTs, is essential. Sequential patient assessments should be performed in patients with known or suspected PE, to identify early signs of deterioration.Precautions should be in place to balance the need for intervention with concerns for safety of the patient and health care personnel. Given that \"rushing\" a patient to theinvasive laboratory or operating room may result in viral containment, planning ahead to avoid such a scenario is important. The therapeutic benefit and risk of both thrombolytic therapy and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in extreme circumstances of cardiopulmonary collapse. Thrombolytic therapy offers a potential expedited therapeutic benefit. Consideration of using ECMO should take into account its' supportive role, inherent need for additional personnel, use of resources and lack of extensive data regarging outcomes and survival. When possible, placement of cannulae and initiation of the ECMO circuit at the bedside is preferred, given the complexity of transport of COVID-19 patients, particularly in urgent situations. For patients with COVID-19 and confirmed PE who have imminent or ongoing hemodynamic collapse, immediate administration of systemic thrombolytic therapy is recommended (with consideration of contraindications", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": ", there is no data to support the use of therapeutic anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy based on these findings alone even in the context of patients who develop refractory respiratory failure.

Follow up appointments, when possible, should be performed virtually via telephone or telemedicine to avoid additional exposure of patients and providers. Follow up appointments should address etiology of the PE, discussion of state associated with COVID-19 and the resultant increased thrombin generation is unequivocably one of the etiologic factors responsible for PE in these patients. However, other possible contributing factors must be addressed as well. During follow up, the clinician should inquire into other conditions that may have played a role in thrombosis. Compliance with ageappropriate cancer screening should be ensured. Thrombophilia evaluation should only be considered if the results are going to change medical management of the patient or impact family members. Discussion regarding anticoagulation medications is another important aspect of followup. During hospitalization, COVID-19 PE patients are typically treated with LMWH and often discharged home on a DOAC. At follow up, the type and specific choice of agent, recommended duration of therapy, and potential side effects should be reviewed. The importance of compliance should be emphasized. Follow up is also an opportunity to address any abnormal results from tests performed during hospitalization. Specifically, many COVID-19 patients may have had abnormal coagulation tests, and these should be re-evaluted and potentially repeated. Furthermore, if a patient had an abnormal echocardiogram, evidence of right ventricular dysfunction, elevated pulmonary artery pressures, or cardiomyopathy, the follow up appointment will ensure this can be repeated to assess for recovery. For patients who underwent placement of an inferior vena cava filter (IVCF), device removal should be planned during the follow up appointment. It should also be appreciated that PE can be associated with profound emotional distress; followup provides an opportunity to evaluate and manage the psychological well-being of these patients. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, followup visits enable providers to assess patients for any new symptoms. In the months to years following a PE, there is a spectrum of morbidity that may occur, ranging from persistent fatigue, dyspnea and reduction in exercise tolerance which are characteristic of post-PE syndrome, to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The follow up appointment allows providers to assess for these conditions in each patient and if present, to promptly evaluate and if available, treat.

However, the presence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude concurrent PE and may, indeed, be an independent risk factor for PE on the basis of poor cardiac output.Risk stratification must take into account the relative contribution of COVID-19 lower respiratory tract infection, versus that of PE, as the cause of respiratory failure. The respiratory and hemodynamic compromise from both the viral pneumonia and the PE need to be investigated fully in order to determine which of these disorders is having the greatest impact and to determine optimal treatment. Consultation with the multi-disciplinary PERT, if available, is recommended to assist with stratification and challenging diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. Studies prior to COVID have demonstrated that having a PERT decreases time to PE diagnosis, time to therapeutic anticoagulation, length of stay During this pandemic, a central challenge to a PERT consultation is the awareness of the communicable nature of COVID-19 for those exposed to patients in the ICU, Cath lab or operating room. If not already performed, recommendation of a COVID-19 test should be done simultaneously with determination of hemodynamic stability. If the patient requires emergent procedural intervention, all preventive measures must be taken for the patient and providers to, from and in the cath lab or operating room. However, if the patient is stable enough to allow for testing to be completed, procedural intervention should be delayed pending results.While COVID-19 testing is pending, medical therapy with appropriate anticoagulation iscarried out with recommendations by the PERT to the primary team. It is imperative for the PERT to remain aware of the patient's status throughout this period. If the patient becomes unstable, intervention may be necessary before COVID-19 test results are available. An open line of communication with the treating ICU staff can keep the PERT up to date on the patients status and any changes that occur.Once COVID-19 testing is complete, an interim patient status assessment should be performed. In general, patient stability supports continuation of ongoing treatment, regardless of COVID-19 status.

In patients with clinical and imaging findings not entirely explained by COVID-19, evaluation for PE should be strongly considered. Elevated D-dimer, in and of itself, should not be used to diagnose suspected PE.If the decision is to monitor at home, the safety and availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should enable carefully selected patients to be treated as outpatients.

If persistent symptoms or concern for RV failure exist, long term follow-up visits may be best evaluated inperson. Monitoring and collection of data obtained during followup visits will help the medical community understand the unique impact of concurrent COVID-19 and PE.Facilities caring for COVID-19 and PE patients are encouraged to join the complimentary PERT Consortium COVID-19/PE Registry, which will provide clinicians with important data on presentation, assessment and management of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary embolism and help shape real-time decision making and patient-level care as this pandemic unfolds.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fDecision-making in PE patients with COVID-19Evaluation of patients with PE and confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should be thorough, while acknowledging that certain testing may not be available, due to concerns about viral transmission or in extremely ill patients who cannot be moved. Assimilation of all available data is of paramount importance. The uniquely complex nature of concurrent COVID-19 and PE underscores the benefits of a multi-disciplinary team based approach such as a PERT to facilitate prompt decision-making. Whenever available, use of an approved electronic platform enables real-time visualization of all available data (e.g. physical examination, images, lab values) with all members of the care team, without necessitating patient contact which reduces not only exposure but also the use of PPE.The benefits of using these tools include the ability to exchange information, to display images and pertinent lab values, and to discuss management options in real time.Furthermore, electronically-mediated connection of members of the PERT and/or others involved enables the \"rapid-response\" and prompt decision-making that is often required for these acutely ill patients. When deciding upon recommendations, the input of experts from different disciplines can be critical for these complex patients; however, only thoseconsultants involved in actually providing intervention should see and examine the patient in person, thereby reducing exposure and the use of PPE. Interventional or surgical consultants should evaluate the patient with the minimum personal contact that is necessary to achieve a thorough understanding of the case, although patient care should never suffer from avoidance of first-hand patient evaluation. Ongoing open lines of communication to share patient data that is inherent in PERTs reduces the need for repeated personal patient evaluation. Adherence to these principles requires careful caseby-case assessment of each COVID-19 patient with PE. In all care of COVID-19 infected patients, exposure should be limited, without compromising the medical information necessary to make critical evidence-based management decisions.
