Although the near-19 field transmission and the infectious spread within individual rooms are well studied, the impact of 20 aerosolized spread of SARS-CoV-2 via air handling systems within buildings remains unexplored. This 21 study evaluates the concentrations and probabilities of infection for both building interior and exterior 22 exposure sources using a well-mixed model in a multi-room building served by a central air handling 23 system (without packaged terminal air conditioning). In particular, we compare the influence of filtration, 24 air change rates, and the fraction of outdoor air. When the air supplied to the rooms comprises both 25 outdoor air and recirculated air, we find filtration lowers the concentration and probability of infection the 26 most in both source and connected rooms. We find that increasing the air change rate removes virus from 27 the source room faster but also increases the rate of exposure in connected rooms. Therefore, slower air 28 change rates reduce infectivity in connected rooms at shorter durations. We further find that increasing 29 the fraction of virus-free outdoor air is helpful, unless outdoor air is infective in which case pathogen 30 exposure inside persists for hours after a short-term release. Increasing the outdoor air to 33% or the filter 31 to MERV-13 decreases the infectivity in the connected rooms by 19% or 93% respectively, relative to a 32 MERV-8 filter with 9% outdoor air based on 100 quanta/h of 5 \u00b5m droplets, a breathing rate of 0.48 m 3 /h, 33 and the building dimensions and air handling system considered. 34 35",

            "text": "reviewed study by de Man, et al., (2020) found that 81% of residents and 50% of health care workers 50 (using surgical masks) became infected in one ward in contrast to the other six wards in the same facility 51 that had no COVID-19 cases. The authors attributed the spread in the ward with infections to the 52 ventilation system, which had recently been remodeled with carbon dioxide sensors that added outdoor air 53 only when the levels were elevated (>1000 ppm) to save energy in contrast to the other wards that had 54 older HVAC systems that supplied a regular rate of outdoor air through the supply ducts. These findings, 55 coupled with widespread evidence of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Lu, et al., 2020; Ho, 2020 of COVID-19, primarily focused on single room analyses similar to a prior review of bio-aerosol spread 67 by Qian and Zheng (2018) . Their primary multiroom recommendation, without a quantitative argument, 68 was that air recirculation should be avoided, which is ideal from an infectivity perspective but not always 69 possible (e.g., HVAC system are not designed and most cannot sustain introduction of 100% outdoor air 70 during particularly hot/humid or cold outdoor conditions). In general, models of aerosolized pathogen 71 spread throughout buildings divide into those that account for local concentration gradients, typically 72 using computational fluid dynamics codes (e.g., Shao, et al., 2020 , for recirculation flows within elevators, 73 classrooms, and supermarkets using a single room formulation inclusive of obstacles), and those that 74 neglect concentration gradients and use well-mixed models (Firrantello, et al., 2007) . Thus far, most 75 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f common plenum, and an air handling system that receives the external source. The air handling system 102 mixes outdoor air with air from the return plenum and delivers that air through a minimum efficiency 103 reporting value (MERV) rated filter to the individual rooms. A well-mixed approximation (although not 104 appropriate for some buildings and room configurations not considered here) is used where the 105 concentration within each room may be assumed to be spatially uniform (gradients in concentration 106 remain negligible or vanish much faster than the concentrations with the rooms).

They are 479 not a worst-case scenario (higher infectivity doses are possible), and infective doses likely vary 480 significantly across individuals and as a function of disease progression. Whether these probabilities of 481 infection are large or small depends on personal and community risk tolerances. For example, an 482 individual may determine that some risk is acceptable as they balance competing individual health, social, 483 and economic needs, or, alternatively, only fully minimized risk may be acceptable to protect a vulnerable 484 person. Furthermore, a community may accept risk by balancing viral spread against access to health care 485 (\"flattening the curve\") while maintaining some economic activity in the process, or, alternatively, a 486 community may seek to eradicate viral spread in the spirit of a cordon sanitaire. Each of these involves 487 different risk tolerances, the balancing of which across a population remains outside the scope of this 488 quantitative analysis. Similarly, each of these scenarios and cases has distinct implications for building 489 energy usage, occupants' comfort, and HVAC equipment maintenance. For example, higher air filtration 490 (i.e., higher MERV rating) uses more fan energy and may impede HVAC system performance if the fan 491 does not have power to overcome resistance or too much pressure is built up. More outdoor air intake 492 increases energy use during the heating or cooling seasons. If the HVAC systems are not sized to handle 493 a high percentage of outdoor air, occupants' thermal comfort will have to be compromised when the 494 temperature setpoints cannot be met.

Are higher air change rates inherently more protective of 60 spaces connected by air handling systems? Does increasing the outdoor air always reduce the probability 61 of infection? Without adequate knowledge of the relative effectiveness of these building interventions in 62 reducing aerosol transmission, building managers and operators are facing a difficult choice of how to 63 maintain a safe, comfortable, and efficient building. 64 Several studies have explored the aerosol spread of SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory diseases 65 within buildings.

            "text": "(a) and (c) shows that in the absence of 308 filtration, the concentration in the source room rises sharply and then gradually decreases as the air 309 containing the virus encapsulating particles mixes with the virus-free air in the remainder of the spaces 310 (e.g., connected rooms, plenum, and AHU), outdoor air exchange continues, particles land on floors, and 311 viral decay reduces concentrations further. In the connected rooms, the concentration is initially zero but 312 rises as infective particles enter via the air handling unit. With filtration, the peak concentration in the 313 connected rooms and the duration of that exposure decrease substantially. For example, a MERV-8 filter 314 decreases the peak virus concentration in connected rooms by a factor of five, and for a MERV-13 filter 315 the decrease is over an order of magnitude. The shape of the curve does not vary significantly as the 316 MERV rating increases, but reducing the peak reduces the time for potentially meaningful concentrations317 to be present. Similarly shaped curves were observed by Emmerich, et al., (2013), who predicted the 318 spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health care facility bathrooms. Because filters do not remove 319 100% of the particles, some of the virus returns back into the source room, especially when the MERV 320 rating is lower. This modestly extends the time it takes for the concentration to drop below preferred 321 levels. (b) and (d) translates these curves into cumulative probabilities of infection by 323 integrating the exposures over time, multiplying by a breathing rate, and exponentiating the product per 324 an assumed Poisson distribution of Wells-Riley. The cumulative probability starts at time zero and only 325 increases over time. In contrast to the concentration curves which, because they are normalized, may 326 represent any suitable concentration units (e.g., particles/volume, moles/volume, mass/volume, 327 droplets/volume, virions/volume, or even quanta or infectious dose), infectivity here is based only on dose 328 measured as quanta. Figure 2 (b) and (d) shows that, in the absence of effective filtration, the probability 329 of infection rises sharply in the source room with a somewhat lower probability of infection in the 330 connected rooms. With filtration, the probability of infection in the source room is attenuated by a 331 percent or two. In the connected rooms, filtration with a MERV-8 filter lowers the risk by almost an 332 order of magnitude and a MERV-13 filter further lowers the risk of infection by another order of 333 magnitude. Even so, there is still a risk of only one in ~7,300 with a MERV-13 filter in the connected 334 room, the lowest probability of infection for any of the cases considered here. Concentrations scaled on the total virus concentration, C total , shed (a and c) and cumulative 339 probabilities of infection (b and d) versus time for the source (a and b) and connected (c and d) rooms 340 across the four conditions of no filter and MERV-8, MERV-11, and MERV-13 filters ((a) and (c) evaluates the influence of the air change rate on the temporal evolution of the 345 virus containing particle concentration. Figure 3 shows that higher air change rates substantially decrease 346 the concentration in the source room. If that room has single occupancy, then this is a relatively 347 unimportant effect because the virus shedding individual does not infect others in the source room. If the 348 room has an occupancy level greater than one (consider multiple occupants in an office) then increasing 349 the ACH would be an important means of minimizing exposure (in the absence of an enhanced near-field 350 concentration (e.g., the downstream exposure in Guangzhou restaurant; Lu, et al., 2020; Ho, 2020), not 351 addressed by a well-mixed model). These results are unsurprising given the multiple reports of this effect 352 in the literature for a single room (Yang and Marr, 2011). However, this is not the end of the story in 353 connected multiroom buildings. As the virus containing particles are removed from the source room they 354proceed through the plenum and the AHU to the connected rooms. As the ACH increases, the peak 355 concentration in the connected rooms rises because more of the flow from the source room transports into 356 the connected rooms, but this concentration persists in these connected rooms for shorter time periods. 357",

This scenario is important because outdoor air 404 is not always virus-free and outdoor spread from building to building has been tied to SARS-CoV-1 405 spread (Yu, et al., 2004; Wu, et al., 2018). Indeed, the exhaust from most buildings is not filtered and 406 virus from a neighboring building's exhaust and relief vents, open windows, or from sewer gasses may be 407 drawn into the AHU. Schuit, et al., (2020) show that high-intensity simulated sunlight, typical of a 408 summer day, drives rapid decay of SARS-CoV-2, decreasing this risk. During the other seasons, the light 409 intensity and heat are lower permitting the virus to persist longer outdoors. In this second scenario all 410rooms are identical and connected. The exposure lasts for 5 minutes as before (short compared to hours 411 of impact), after which the outdoor air is again assumed to be virus-free.
