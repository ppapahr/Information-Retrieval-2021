As of 15th June 2020, there have been more than 7.9 million confirmed cases with over 434,793 deaths worldwide [1]. Co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, obesity, and hypertension are associated with severe illness, morbidity, and mortality [2] . In clinical practice, there have been reports of patients with COVID-19 presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) in those with previously well-controlled DM [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, the evidence is still emerging regarding hyperglycemic emergencies in patients with COVID-19.",

It is currently proposed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may play a role in the pathophysiology of glucose dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 [12] . We now understand that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a ligand to bind to its target cells [13] . ACE2 is also expressed on the pancreas as well as other vital organs like lungs and small intestine [14] . SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic cells can potentially cause direct beta-cell damage [15] . ACE2 expression has been shown to be downregulated once SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell [16] . This could lead to dysregulation of insulin secretion [17] . Another proposed mechanism is an exaggerated response of pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6) [3] .",
