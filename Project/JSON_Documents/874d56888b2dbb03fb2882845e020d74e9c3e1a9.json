We conducted an online survey comprising items on demographic data; two self-designed questionnaires (children's behavioral problems/psychological demand of parents during COVID-19); and four standardized questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire, Perceived Social Support, Parenting Stress Index, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory. The results showed that there were significant differences among parents of children with different challenges. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents whose children had an intellectual disability or a visual or hearing impairment. Behavioral problems of children and psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent-child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, having a difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with having children with an intellectual disability. It is necessary to pay attention to the parents' mental health, provide more social and family support, and reduce parenting pressures.",

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Faced with such a critical situation, the Chinese government issued nationwide emergency policies in a short time, including shutting down schools and working places, home quarantine, and other public requirements to limit population mobility. Although these policies could effectively cut off the spread of the virus, these measures are associated with mental health problems, such as anxiety, self-reported stress, and disturbed sleep [1, 2] . Many studies have reported the mental health status of medical staff and the general public; however, few have focused on more vulnerable groups such as children with disabilities (i.e., special needs children) and their parents.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide home quarantine that caused school and rehabilitation training institution closure required millions of children with disabilities to stay at home for months [4] . Some children with disabilities might experience behavioral regression and extensive problems because of their inability to access daily school education, rehabilitation training, personalized intervention, and treatments. Instead, parents have to undertake multiple tasks, including parenting, education, rehabilitation, and training, which could increase their parenting stress and cause mental health problems.",

The anxiety and depression scores of parents of special needs children were significantly higher than those of typically developing children [9] , whereas the rating of anxiety and depression were always moderately in agreement across parents and children [10, 11] . Studies also suggested that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder almost always experience more mental health problems than the other forms of handicaps, such as intellectual disabilities [10, 12] .",

In general, parents of special needs children have to continually seek for more special treatment, medical equipment and other educational services, which more likely to lead to higher economic burden [21] . In the meantime, one of the parents should always be a main caregiver for the special needs child which may cause an overall decline in the family's ability to work and reduce family income [22] . Therefore, parents of special needs children were always experience poverty because of lower economic and social status or unemployment as compared to their counterparts [9] , which exacerbates mental health problems [22] . In addition, the serious behavioral and emotional problems of special needs children, and the pressure to raise such children were main challenge for parents [17, 18, 23] . Compared to typically developing children, special needs children are more likely to exhibit externalized behaviors, such as difficulties communicating, poor social relationships, and oppositional defiant disorder [24] . The range of serious behavioral problems continually strengthen the parental stress and trigger parents into a poor mental health cycle. Even the frequent regulatory problems of children, such as sleep problems, are also associated with worse mental health condition among parents [25] . It is noted that children's behavior problems and parenting stress always occur together to predict the mental health of parents. Furthermore, other studies have reported that social support was an important factor for reducing parenting stress and promoting their ability to cope with mental health problems [19, 20] . Unfortunately, parents of special needs children are often excluded from society and public concern, even though positive attitudes of raising special needs children among parents is always related to more social support [20] . These risk factors strengthen mental health problems among parents of special needs children.",

In this study, the three groups of special needs children had regulatory problems (such as an unwillingness to wear masks and unwillingness to wash hands) and externalized problems (such as asking to go out and mood swings).

Among the behavioral problems of autism disorders, the core issues include communication impairments and interference with restrictive behaviors [17] . In this study, we reported six behavioral problems in children, such as unwillingness to wear masks, unwillingness to wash hands, asking to go out, sleep problems, eating problems, and mood swings. These may be important manifestations of restrictive behaviors in children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. In normal times, children with autism may also experience tantrums, impatience, and anxiety because they cannot go outside or are not used to obeying the new rules (such as wearing a mask). However, at the same time, children with autism spectrum disorder are not good at communicating with parents and solving problems independently [39] . Consequently, parents have to exert more time and resources, which may increase more parenting stress. From this perspective, children's behavioral problems are closely related to parenting pressure, and jointly predict mental health among parents. Furthermore, behavioral problems in children with autism are also associated with parent-child dysfunctional interactions among parents. Studies have shown that there is a two-way connection between parent-child relationships and behavioral problems in children [40] . This means that children's behavioral problems could predict the tendency or change in the emotional quality of parent-child relationships. In other words, parents have to work harder during these parent-child interactions [41] . When repeated and restrictive behavioral problems are difficult to solve, parents tend to be more directive and control by employing verbal or corporal punishments, which decrease closeness and increase parent-child dysfunction [42] . Over time, this not only strengthens behavioral problems in children, but also results in increased mental health problems of parents.",

Such children need more sustained, long-term, and repeated training, which could gradually improve their daily behavior. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, policies not only interrupted children from receiving rehabilitation treatment, but also increased their externalized problems in the absence of social activities, increased loneliness, and insufficient information [4] . Furthermore, frequent regulatory problems (such as sleep problems) are also common behavioral problems in children with intellectual disabilities, which usually affect parents' mental health [44] .
