This sector is responsible for approximately 36% of CO 2 emissions and 40% of the final energy demands [1, 2] . In Portugal, the Building sector is responsible for around 30% of the final energy consumption and Ara\u00fajo et al. [3] reported that 50% of this consumption can be reduced by using energy efficiency measures corresponding to 400 million tons of saved CO 2 emissions. Therefore, buildings may provide an important opportunity to reduce energy consumption and thus to minimize the negative impacts on global warming. Consequently, great challenges to achieve the decarbonization agenda of the EU and make this sector energy efficient are occurring in the building sector.",

Computer simulation tools are an effective method to analyze different systems such as manufacturing procedures, construction processes, and energy analysis [5, 6] . Building dynamic simulations play an important role in determining the optimal design variables since the building's response to these new features can be highly sensitive to local climate factors. The major tools in the building energy field are whole-building energy simulation programs that consider key performance indicators such as energy demand and costs [7] . De Boeck et al. [8] provide a recent literature review on improving the energy performance of residential buildings by the following topics: area of application and design variables, objectives and performance measures, type of analysis, solution methodology, software tools, case study location and type of building. There is a recent trend in more papers leading to energy objectives. However, the author recommended some important future research opportunities, based on imperfections of past studies, such as the specific trade-off between winter and summer energy consumptions that should be considered to find suitable energy efficiency solutions. Furthermore, the author highlighted the most applied tools in the literature and EnergyPlus is one of them.",

For instance, \u00d8sterg\u00e5rd et al. [9] reviewed the recent developments in both academia and in the commercial software industry that target challenges in building energy simulation. Based on this review, the authors proposed a simulation framework that facilitates proactive, intelligent and experience-based building simulation. Lopes et al. [10] recently provided an important literature review concerning energy efficiency policies and regulations for buildings, highlighting how the Brazilian labeling program can be improved compared to the Portugal and United States programs. Previously, in 2009, P\u00e9rez-Lombard et al. [11] analyzed the origin and the historic development of energy certification schemes in buildings along with the definition, scope and critical aspects of a building energy certificate. Other interesting works in this area are the works developed by Ara\u00fajo et al. [3] , Abela et al. [12] and Li et al. [13] . The first author analyzed the Portuguese thermal regulation for residential buildings and studied the influence of some parameters considered as important to the energy efficiency of buildings on energy performance and the energy certification rate. Abela et al. [12] , in its turn, investigated if the current calculation methodologies in utilization for the generation of energy performance certification processes in the Mediterranean countries are appropriated. The authors analyzed different national methodologies from Cyprus, Italy, Malta, and Spain on four test case study dwellings. Finally, Li et al. [13] provided a review of the current energy performance certificate situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements.",

However, the profiles of the variables that characterize the use of the different thermal zones were defined, such as occupation, use of electrical equipment, lighting, ventilation, thermostats, metabolic rate, fans, among others, since they have different working periods. Correct determination of a profile requires defining its typical behavior on a day, defining the corresponding period (weekly, monthly, or yearly), as well as including possible constraints (holidays). The different periods were all defined individually in both energy programs. The process of schedules definition in Revit is much more restrictive, compared to OpenStudio. While in OpenStudio it is possible to define an opening time for different periods of the week, month and year, in Revit it is only possible to define a time which is constant throughout the year.
