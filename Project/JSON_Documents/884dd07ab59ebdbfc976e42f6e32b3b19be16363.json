However, procedures applicable to and knowledge acquired from studies related to domestic animal and human health can be on partly extrapolated to wildlife. This article identifies requirements and challenges inherent in wildlife health investigations, reviews important definitions and novel health investigation methods, and proposes tools and strategies for effective wildlife health surveillance programs. Impediments to wildlife health investigations are largely related to zoological, behavioral and ecological characteristics of wildlife populations and to limited access to investigation materials. These concerns should not be viewed as insurmountable but it is imperative that they are considered in study design, data analysis and result interpretation. It is particularly crucial to remember that health surveillance does not begin in the laboratory but in the fields. In this context, participatory approaches and mutual respect are essential. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity and open minds are necessary because a wide range of tools and knowledge from different fields need to be integrated in wildlife health surveillance and research. The identification of factors contributing to disease emergence requires the comparison of health and ecological data over time and among geographical regions. Finally, there is a need for the development and validation of diagnostic tests for wildlife species and for data on free-ranging population densities. Training of health professionals in wildlife diseases should also be improved. Overall, the article particularly emphasizes five needs of wildlife health investigations: communication and collaboration; use of synergies and triangulation approaches; investments for the long term; systematic collection of metadata; and harmonization of definitions and methods.",

It requires a new set of definitions, methods and procedures, taking into account the unique conditions under which wildlife health surveillance is carried out [5] . Laboratories still tend to rely on domestic animal surveillance approaches in their investigations into wildlife pathogens. It is important to stress that although the growing interest in wildlife health is definitely a positive trend, this reliance bears a substantial risk of error at various levels ranging from initial study design all the way up to result interpretation. This article reviews the factors to consider when investigating the health of free-ranging wildlife, including the challenges and constraints inherent in such investigations, with a particular focus on surveillance. The aims are to provide: (1) revised definitions of old concepts; (2) an update on the importance of influencing factors on wildlife health investigations; (3) an overview of tools available to wildlife health investigators.",

In veterinary medicine, health has been defined as \"a state of physical and psychological well-being and of productivity, including reproduction\" and \"health indices\" refer to easily observed parameters that can be used as a guide to the animal's or group's state of health (e.g., food intake, fecal output, body weight) [7] . It has recently been proposed to redefine health as \"the ability to adapt and to self-manage\" [8, 9] , i.e., an organism is healthy if it is capable of maintaining physiological homeostasis through changing circumstances. If it is unable to mount a protective response, reducing the potential for harm and restoring an (adapted) equilibrium, damage remains and may result in illness [9] . Accordingly, measuring health is challenging and requires tools for assessing an individual's capacity to cope and to adapt. It is also important to differentiate between the health status of individuals and that of populations [9] .",

Population health is concerned with the definition and measurement of health outcomes (the dependent variables) and the roles of determinants (the independent variables). The term \"health outcome\" is preferred over \"health status\", because the latter refers to health at a point in time rather than to health over a period of years [10] . A hallmark of the field of population health is significant attention to the multiple determinants of health outcomes and their interactions, i.e., examining: systematic differences in outcomes across populations; the complexity of interactions among determinants; the biological pathways linking determinants to population health outcomes; the influence of different determinants over time and throughout the life cycle. While specific investigations into a single determinant, outcome measure, or policy intervention are relevant and may even be critical in some cases, they must be recognized as being only part of a more complex picture [10] .",

Virulence and pathogenicity both refer to the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. However, while virulence is a continuous variable defined by the amount of damage that is caused, pathogenicity refers to the quality of disease induction and is a discontinuous variable (yes or no) referring to the capacity of a microbe to cause damage in a (susceptible) host [14] . It is not possible to draw a clear and unequivocal distinction between pathogens and non-pathogens. Properties conferring pathogenicity depend as much on the host as they do on the microorganism. They may be influenced by multiple factors such as environmental stress, pollutants and other microorganisms [15] [16] [17] . Such alterations can create conditions in which the host becomes vulnerable to microbes which were previously non-pathogenic. When the immune response of the host to a microbe is insufficient, microbial factors can cause damage; when microbial factors fail to stimulate the immune system, the microbe can disseminate and cause disease; and when the immune response to a microbe is too exuberant, it can be the immune response itself that is responsible for the pathology. In other words, pathogenicity can be due to the immune response to the pathogen rather than to the pathogen itself [14] . Consequently, attempts to classify micro-or macroparasites as pathogens, non-pathogens, opportunists, commensals and so forth are misguided because they attribute a property to the parasite that is instead a function of the host, the parasite and their interaction [14] .",

Its purpose is to support effective decisionmaking, including policy and priority setting, response to outbreaks and approval of trade movements. The outputs generated by wildlife surveillance systems can include the detection of new disease events, the demonstration of freedom from specific diseases or infections, or identification of the level and distribution of diseases endemically present in a population [18, 19] . The first integral activities of disease surveillance are detection of disease or pathogens. Further activities include information management, i.e. analysis of the collected data and use of the surveillance information for decision-making and policy formulation [20] . For these two last aspects, it is essential to record and store data, e.g., to continuously conduct a database and to communicate important results such as disease emergence to the competent managers and authorities. Indeed, a key aspect of health surveillance is the early detection of outbreaks or what we call early warning systems.",

It usually corresponds to clinical surveillance aimed at detecting dead or visibly sick animals (followed by diagnosis or precise disease identification), i.e., identifying disease events in which wild animals are the victims [4, 20] . Scanning surveillance is typically performed by investigation of animal carcasses or tissues from dead animals. The accurate identification of a mortality event requires a thorough pathological examination carried out by a wildlife specialist following standardized procedures and complemented by further laboratory analyses [5] . However, in the case of important pathogens such as zoonotic agents or those with economic importance for which wildlife hosts may act as healthy carriers, surveillance cannot be based on the collection of clinical data such as morbidity or mortality [5] .",

These investigations may focus on populations of apparently healthy animals [4, 20] . Traditionally, targeted surveillance of wildlife has relied on a crosssectional study design because this only requires a point sample (single capture or sample collection). Collected data most often relate to the identification of risk factors associated with disease, pathogen, or antibody prevalence. It is therefore essential to aim at a sample size that can provide reliable prevalence estimates and statistical comparison and to incorporate relevant biological, spatial and temporal variables [21] .",

Appropriate diagnostics (such as standardized health screening, ancillary diagnostic tests and thorough postmortem examinations) on diseased wild animals submitted to wildlife rehabilitation centers can enhance surveillance efforts [21, [25] [26] [27] . Clinical examinations can be performed within the context of wildlife captures [28, 29] and are an essential component of translocation programs due to the substantial health risks involved [30] . Phototrapping can deliver valuable information about diseases with typical external lesions such as sarcoptic mange [31] ( Figure 1 ). Infrared thermal imaging has been tested as a potential tool for the tele-diagnosis of sarcoptic mange in the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) [32] . Non-invasive samples, such as feces, hair and feathers may be suitable for the detection of pathogens or toxic compounds. For example, in a study on endoparasites in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex), the number of feces samples collected from captured animals was insufficient for a comprehensive study and was substantially increased by collecting feces from the ground [29] . Finally, questionnaire surveys and interviews with wildlife managers, hunters and others working in the field can provide valuable information on disease occurrence.",

Investigations into the efficacy of using different information sources for detecting disease occurrence showed that analysis of indicator animals (i.e., animals found dead or presenting disease signs) is more efficient than analysis of animals expected to be healthy (such as hunted animals). This observation led to the recommendation of focusing surveillance efforts on indicator animals when a disease of concern appears to be absent in a wildlife population. Enhanced surveillance efforts, including systematic sampling of apparently healthy animals for prevalence estimation, should only be implemented when cases have been detected. Towards the end of an outbreak, the aim of disease surveillance should shift back to case detection [44] . This approach has been applied for rabies in Switzerland, where surveillance efforts progressively evolved towards clinical surveillance after rabies was eradicated [45] .",

It is important to define which parameters to target (e.g., lesion, pathogen, antibody). Selection will depend on factors such as the host species, expected sample size, logistic constraints, cost of laboratory analyses and specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests [46] . A pathological examination is required to determine the cause of death or disease of an animal. This examination identifies tissue lesions and paves the way for appropriate additional investigations, such as bacteriological or parasitological examination. Also, the presence of lesions must be demonstrably associated with a given pathogen to prove that an etiological link exists between pathogen and death. Detection of exposure to pathogens is generally achieved by laboratory analyses such as agent isolation, PCR testing or serology [5] . To spare costs, it may be advisable to pool samples for analysis [37, 46, 47] . Non-infectious diseases may require toxicologic or genetic investigations. Toxicology is a discipline of major importance in wildlife, as both intentional poisoning and accidental intoxications frequently occur [48] . Illegal killing of wildlife is a widespread problem worldwide, and forensic approaches may be necessary when determining the cause of death in wild animals.",

In the case of infectious keratoconjunctivitis caused by Mycoplasma conjunctivae in Alpine ruminants, molecular studies revealed the simultaneous occurrence of the same strain of M. conjunctivae in different hosts of the same region, supporting the hypothesis of interspecific transmission [49] . Strains of M. conjunctivae identical to each other were also identified both in healthy and diseased hosts, suggesting that factors other than the strain of mycoplasma determine the outcome of an infection [50, 51] . In contrast, comparison of Brucella suis from wild boar (Sus scrofa) and domestic pigs from the same geographical area presented differences that did not support the assumption that wild boar were the source of the outbreak in pigs [24, 52] .",

The probability of contacts and risk of epidemic spread is therefore higher for social or gregarious animals than for solitary species. For example, while sarcoptic mange and distemper rapidly spread among red fox populations, cases in more solitary species like the Eurasian lynx remain isolated [28, 64] . Gregarious lifestyle and inter-group movements have been shown to contribute to tuberculosis maintenance in some species despite low overall prevalence in the population [43] . Disease spread may also vary among sexes depending on the social organization of the species. In an epidemic of infectious keratoconjunctivitis in Alpine chamois in the Swiss Alps, numerous females and juveniles died while solitary adult males remained largely unaffected; after the mating season, the number of affected males dramatically increased [65] . Finally, interspecific interactions need to be considered when assessing the epidemiological role of a host species. Among other things, it is necessary to assess the real status of livestock to determine the epidemiological role of a wild species in domestic animal disease [11, 46] . For example, investigations on bluetongue, bovine viral diarrhea virus and other abortive agents in wild ruminants from Switzerland suggest that wildlife is not a reservoir but rather an occasional spillover host for these pathogens, as infections of wild ruminants is only sporadic while domestic ruminants display significantly higher prevalences of infection [37, 47, 66] . Interspecific interactions can also influence disease dynamics in other ways. Thus, marked advances of the epidemic front of sarcoptic mange in Sweden were associated with new vole cycles, possibly because years with high vole numbers (i.e., high prey numbers for foxes) result in high reproduction and juvenile fox survival rates and thus in enhanced fox dispersal [67] .",

Time is a quantitative scale against which all other aspects of disease can and should be measured [69] . The season of sampling should be considered whenever assessing the risk of infection by pathogens [70] or using wildlife as an accumulative bioindicator of environmental pollution [11] . Pathogen transmission is affected by climatic conditions (survival of the pathogen in the environment, activity of arthropod vectors, geographical distribution of host species) [18] as well as by intraspecific contacts (e.g., mating season) [65] and interspecific interactions (e.g., presence of livestock on alpine pastures during the summer grazing season) [49, 71] . Severe weather events can affect host immunity and nutrition if they interrupt forage availability and feeding patterns [18, 70] , as well as the abundance of arthropod vectors [13] . Seasonal changes in hormonal activities may also influence host susceptibility [72] . Because seasonal changes can be related either to climatic conditions or to physiological and behavioral patterns, it has been proposed that seasons be specified both as calendar seasons and as species-specific biologic periods [51, 73] . An example of climate-related seasonal disease pattern is the observed increased prevalence of sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) in the Sierra Nevada in winter and spring months, probably because low temperature and high relative humidity are favorable to mange mites [74] .",

Migratory behavior is strongly linked to seasonal changes and typically allows for contacts with other hosts and thus for pathogen spread and acquisition. For example, vertical short-distance migration in red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) in the Swiss Alps and food shortage in winter enhances the risk of contacts between red deer and cattle during the cold season. When red deer move to lower altitudes and share food resources with domestic livestock, a situation known as a risk factor for pathogen transmission arises [37] . Prevalence of low pathogenic avian influenza virus in ducks in the northern hemisphere is highest during late summer and early fall (pre-migration staging) and declines during winter [68] . More importantly, horizontal long-distance bird migration has most likely played a major role in the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Europe [75] . Finally, biological dispersal (animal movement away from an existing population or from the parent organisms) is known to contribute to pathogen spread. For example, red fox dispersal is believed to favor the propagation of sarcoptic mange [67] .",

Spatial epidemiology also enables to investigate relationships between the environment and the presence of disease, and to predict disease spread [76] . Natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ranges can temporarily block disease spread, as has been observed for infectious keratoconjunctivitis in Alpine chamois and for rabies in red fox in Switzerland [65, 77] . Spatial representation of pathogen exposure in different species can also contribute to the understanding of epidemiological roles. Thus, investigations in Switzerland suggest that infections of wild ruminants with bluetongue virus are associated with foci of infection in domestic ruminants [47] . Similarly, exposure of wild ruminants to the viral bovine diarrhea virus seems to be related to their presence on summer Alpine pastures where interactions with cattle regularly occur [37] . Differences in human population density have been shown to be associated with significantly different exposure to Toxoplasma gondii and Orthopoxvirus in Swedish Eurasian lynx. This could relate to the concomitant presence of domestic cats in the area [61, 73] .",

For example, sarcoptic mange has had a stronger impact on red fox populations in boreal forests than in mixed agriculture-forest areas of Sweden. This is presumably because groups of foxes are larger and live in smaller territories in highly productive regions, and because the more patchy distribution of food and shelters favor disease spread [78] . Environmental characteristics such as temperature and humidity can impact pathogen survival. Thus, foxes are more often infected with Echinococcus multilocularis in humid than dry environments [79] . Pathogen and disease distribution can also vary with altitude (due to variations in the distribution of susceptible hosts and in the occurrence of arthropod vectors) and with sun exposure (influencing climatic conditions and thus pathogen persistence in the environment) [18] . The results of recent investigations on infectious keratoconjunctivitis in wild Caprinae have suggested a role of altitude (or associated environmental conditions such as UV-light, temperature, humidity) in pathogenesis of eye lesions due to Mycoplasma conjunctivae [80] . Also, soil composition, vegetation and stagnating water can influence the occurrence of pathogens and their vectors or the presence of toxic compounds [18] . Overall, natural and anthropogenic barriers and spatial distribution of wild and domestic hosts need to be taken into consideration when defining epidemiological or sampling units [37, 50, 66, 81] .",

Controlled experiments allow for a better understanding of pathogenesis, contribute to the development and validation of diagnostic methods and to targeted management recommendations [21, 56] . Experimental studies should ideally combine lab experiments (e.g., experimental infections) with field experiments (e.g., testing hypotheses regarding the effect of host aggregation and density on disease prevalence or pathogen persistence). Furthermore, mathematical modeling may help to identify knowledge gaps and design experimental research [56] . Models can also contribute to the understanding of disease dynamics and the impact of diseases on populations [84, 85] .

In contrast, the human dimension of wildlife investigations is rarely addressed. This is rather surprising as the collaboration with field professionals, local managers and the general public, is usually essential to accessing information on wildlife health. Nevertheless, there has been a recent recommendation for taking the country's historical and cultural context into account in the frame of wildlife sampling [4] . The increasing interest in participatory epidemiology also underlines the need for a customeroriented approach. Pro-active work in the field and the delivery of surveillance outputs that are meaningful to stakeholders are required, because motivation to carry out effective disease surveillance will decrease in the absence of adequate feedback [19] . Participatory approaches, translated into the field of wildlife disease investigation, mean improved communication between hunters or wildlife managers and animal health services. Presence of researchers in the field (e.g. participation in sample collection, courses) combined with providing regular feedback to field partners positively influences the access to general information on disease occurrence and facilitates sample collection [89] .",

However, the difficulties inherent in wildlife health investigations (see below), the need for baseline data, the complete lack of reports in certain regions of the world or on secretive species, may render anecdotal information or negative results valuable for surveillance purposes. Also, it is important to keep in mind that publication is a means of communication for sharing experience and information, and not primarily a vehicle for prestige and recognition. Negative data are greatly underrepresented in the literature despite the fact that they can be extremely important to our understanding of diseases [21] . Among others, the absence of pathogen exposure detection provides necessary baseline data in the surveillance of emerging diseases. Similarly, the value of publishing failed experiments is underestimated. It is important that we benefit from each other mistakes and not continue to reinvent the wheel [94] .",

Scanning surveillance requires the observation of clinically diseased or dead animals, reporting these observations, and the submission of carcasses or samples by the public and field professionals for analysis. Overall, only a very small portion of dead wildlife is both found and examined. Wild animals may inhabit remote areas and are often difficult to approach and examine; clinical expression may be brief [5] and survival behaviors often mask clinical signs of disease in wildlife [86] ; capture and containment of moribund animals may not be feasible and represents additional steps to be surmounted in the submission chain [21] . Predation, scavenging and carcass decomposition may obscure the observation of dead animals and usually complicate the diagnostic process when carcasses are found [21, 86] . Detection biases can arise from the cause of death. For example, a study on Eurasian lynx showed that infectious diseases are underrepresented in animals found by chance while mortality resulting from anthropogenic activities is overrepresented [95] . The use of dogs has been shown to be an efficient method for increasing detection of diseased or dead animals, including medium-sized to small mammals particularly difficult to detect, and thus of decreasing bias in the recovered study material [96, 97] .",

The perceived value of individual species (e.g., game vs. non-game) or perceived need for a submission (mass mortality vs. single case, awareness of pathogen spread) will largely influence the decision of whether or not to submit a carcass for pathological investigation [21] . Thus, after the first cases of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza were discovered in Switzerland in 2006, a significant rise of bird carcass submission was noticed at the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health (FIWI) in Bern although all potential influenza cases were sent to the reference laboratory at Zurich University ( Figure 2) . Similarly, the number of submitted red foxes and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) dramatically increased during an epidemic of distemper in wild carnivores [64] , including cases that had died of other diseases (FIWI archives, unpublished data). However, despite the listed impediments, scanning surveillance retains considerable potential value. It provides an ideal setting for disease discovery, in particular of emerging diseases of wildlife, as has been the case for [101] and the recrudescence of cases in 2010 was partly due to an epidemic of salmonellosis in passerine birds [99] . chronic wasting disease and bovine tuberculosis in the United States [21] , for babesiosis in Alpine chamois and salmonellosis in passerine birds in Switzerland [98, 99] or for avian pox in British tit species [100] .",

To guarantee a certain level of detection and accuracy, the number of samples needed is a function of the population size combined with the expected number of positive animals. When an expected prevalence is not known, sampling intensity should focus on finding at least one positive animal assuming a very low prevalence, which often requires a very large sample size [68] . This approach has been successfully used in studies on bluetongue virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus infections in wild ruminants in Switzerland [37, 47] . Ideally, samples originate from sources that do not compromise animal health. However, capture options are often limited. Wildlife trapping requires a considerable knowhow, is extremely demanding in both time and financial resources and may result in very low sample sizes [21, 94] . For example, in Switzerland in the winter of 2011/2012, six months of \"capture duty\" with three different capture systems [102] and the contributions of numerous biologists, veterinarians, hunters and professional game wardens, resulted in the capture of four Eurasian lynx. Similarly, three capture seasons of 2-3 months each involving full-time presence of a capture team in the fields on a single study site resulted in samples from 39 ibex [29] , while blood samples from 520 hunted ibex were obtained during the corresponding hunting seasons [66] . Additionally, legal constraints may prevent systematic sampling of a wild animal population [94] .",

This method is also limited to specific periods of the year and geographical areas. Hunted animals are often selected based on nonrandom criteria such as antler development or on hunting plans and may not be representative of either the age or gender structure of the population. In addition, capture or killing of animals for specimen collection may result in the rapid dispersal of contagious animals [86] . Consequently, plans for general surveillance are often limited to opportunistic sampling of animals using whatever means are available to collect specimens for necropsy and laboratory tests [4] . Even in the frame of targeted investigations, sampling largely results in convenience sampling despite strong efforts towards representativity and stratification. Overall, sample collection of free ranging wildlife usually represents a compromise due to availability [21] .",

Filter papers seem to be a promising tool for antibody surveys, as they are an inexpensive sample media well suited for harsh environmental conditions [103] . Similarly, FTA technology (fast technology for analysis of nucleic acids, i.e., a paper-based system designed to fix and store nucleic acids directly from fresh tissues) represents an alternative method when field conditions limit the ability to properly store or ship traditional sample materials. Among others, the cards can inactivate infectious agents, which reduces the risk and restrictions associated with transporting samples [105] . When samples like blood or body fluids are not obtainable from carcasses, the use of fluids obtained from organ samples such as lung extract [106] or meat juice [107] may be considered.",

In a susceptible animal, exposure may lead to inapparent (or silent/subclinical) infection or to clinical infection with disease signs of variable severity and resulting in different outcomes including chronic illness, recovery, or death. Despite the absence of clinical signs, infected animals may shed the pathogen either continuously or intermittently. Such a carrier status may occur in inapparent infections (healthy carriers), during incubation (incubatory carriers), or during recovery (convalescent carriers) [114] . Considerable misunderstanding has arisen from using serosurveys for wildlife disease surveillance because the distinction between infection (past or current) and disease is not always recognized. This leads to the misconception that infectious diseases are widespread in free-ranging wild populations. When an infectious agent is endemic and the host has evolved in this given environment, disease is the exception, not the rule [13] . For example, the hemoparasite Cytauxzoon felis is widespread in healthy bobcats (Lynx rufus) and only rarely associated with clinical signs, but it generally causes fatal acute disease in domestic cats [115] .",

Horn growth delivers accurate information in bovids while antler size in cervids is useless. Tooth wear provides inaccurate data of limited reliability in case of a sole macroscopic examination. Counting horn cementum annuli of tooth roots allows exact determination of age in many animals and is often applied on carnivores [73, 118] but it is very expensive.

First, reports of unusual health events and the submission of carcasses largely depend on disease awareness, personal interests and the good will of the public and of field professionals. Second, targeted studies dealing with infectious pathogens generally require an effective collaboration with hunters, as the carcasses of hunted animals are an irreplaceable source of samples. In this context, direct human contacts are essential for a sustainable surveillance system. Close interactions with field partners and regular feedback should be an integral part of any project requiring wildlife samples. Sharing knowledge is a bilateral process in which all involved partners give and receive. However, as new technologies are developed, as software systems allow better data storage and as electronics facilitate rapid communication, the human dimension of wildlife health investigations tends to be neglected. Along similar lines, Nature recently quoted an epidemiologist as warning against the \"mirage of technology\" in surveillance; he emphasized that \"the labs' top priority should be building teams of local staff who are familiar with the region, its language and practices, such local knowledge being crucial to interpreting data\" [119] . Nevertheless, when non-professional field partners are recruited for sampling campaigns, it is essential to provide them with adequate equipment and information to ensure personal safety.",

Also, the number of published articles in scientific journals is exponentially increasing. Unfortunately, publications are partly promoted for prestige purposes.

Similarly, for targeted investigations a triangulation approach, such as the combination of antibody or pathogen surveys with pathological investigations, or of laboratory or field investigations with questionnaire enquiries, may be useful to access a satisfying amount of data and increase result reliability. Different methods may also act in synergy: presence in the fields for targeted sampling usually increases disease awareness in hunters and game wardens, who may subsequently submit more cases for scanning surveillance; feedback from the laboratory to the fields in the form of reports on investigated carcasses will encourage field partners to participate in future sampling campaigns; teaching efforts also contribute to the success of surveillance by increasing the interest of field partners for health issues; conversely, data arising from surveillance are useful for teaching purposes.
