Based on this information, we suggest that more preventive initiatives are taken during the pandemic, specifically, in reaching out with interventions addressed directly to active online child sexual offenders.",

Recently, activity has increased across perpetrator forums on onion sites, sometimes called the darknet. The socalled onion sites apply onion services' protocol for extra security, with the tradeoff that the users, in order to access them, need a specialized web browser such as Tor. Onion sites maintain a high degree of anonymity, hence making it difficult to connect an identity with one's online activity. On the one hand, this allows individuals to speak freely and have more control over their privacy. On the other hand, this also makes it easier to evade law enforcement and commit illegal actions, such as the ability to download and spread CSAM with fewer ties to their identity.",

It contains weekly module content, assignments between modules, and weekly individual therapist feedback over eight weeks. It is hypothesized that CBT is more effective than an active placebo in reducing the primary outcome, which is self-reported time viewing CSAM. Secondary outcome measures include offline offending behavior, severity of CSAM, and quality of life. We believe internetassisted psychotherapy can be effective for this patient group, as it has been shown to be as effective as in-person therapy for many other psychiatric ailments (Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, & Hedman, 2014) . The study is preregistered (http://www.isrct n.com/), is approved by the Swedish Ethics Appeal Review Board (Reference No.: Dnr \u00d6 1-2019), and its design is outlined in Fig. 1 .",

We have noticed the following changes in the forums: Firstly, an increased number of chatters have been seen in the forums. This has seemingly not impacted the pace of recruitment, but it is difficult to draw conclusions. In the largest forum, there are normally 100-150 active persons at one time, but after the lockdown the numbers increased to 300-400 on average. This change in activity was also seen in smaller forums. Over the last year of recruitment for \"Prevent It,\" there has been some variation in the patterns of posting times and activity of users noticed, and there has been a distinct change. Based on conversations of the individuals in the chat rooms, the impression is that the increase is a combination of current users having more time to spend online, new users taking the step to explore onion sites to find more extreme material, as well as users who have tried to quit but have now returned. Secondly, there has been an increase in aggressive messages, both toward other CSAM users and \"Prevent It\" recruiting staff. Thirdly, a change was noted in direct comments about the pandemic. Many users discussed the opportunities that could come with the changes, with comments about home schooling and babysitting during the lockdowns. Some also expressed an increased boredom and preoccupation of sexual thoughts. Lastly, a change was seen in the type of content individuals posted. There has been an increase in posts pertaining to instructions on how to get access to children to produce and share more material. These observed changes have also been confirmed with Swedish Police authority (L. Larsson, personal email communication, April 24, 2020).",

With the current work and study from home directives, it is possible these numbers have increased. While there is a greater risk for sexual offending, there is also an increased opportunity for online intervention because individuals now have more time to dedicate toward treatment if they have the motivation.",
