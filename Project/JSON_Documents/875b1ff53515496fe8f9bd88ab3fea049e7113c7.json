COVID-19 is characterized by sustained cytokines production and hyper-inflammation, can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with a fatality rate around 2-5%. There are currently no prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment agents available recommended for COVID-19. The management of COVID-19 patients remains largely symptomatic and supportive therapy for severe patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. During the last decade, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. MSCs have already secured conditional approved for the treatment of children with graft-versus-host disease for its inflammation suppressing previlege. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model and clinical trial. In previous study, the safety and primary efficacy of MSC have been evaluated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the underlying mechanisms have been studied in some pre-clinical settings. It seems that MSC-based treatments principally contributed to inhibit the uncontrolled immune inflammatory response, benefit the recovery of lung function, and were conductive to delay the progress of lung fibrosis. Accordingly, these findings raise the hypothesis that use of MSCs transfusion could be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. As a first step in testing safety, we did a phase 1, open-label trial in 20 patients with severe COVID-19, using a dose of 3\u00d710 7 umbilical cord-MSCs(UC-MSCs) at 3-day intervals by intravenous reinfusion that may contribute to alleviate hyper-inflammation response. Infusions were well tolerated. Given the in-vitro and in-vivo benefit of MSCs and the acceptable tolerance and safety in humans, we developed this trial with the objective of evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous UC-MSCs in adults with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.",
