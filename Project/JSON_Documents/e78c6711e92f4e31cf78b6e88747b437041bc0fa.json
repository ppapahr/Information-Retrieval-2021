However, a fundamental algorithmic question underlying such mechanisms is hardly understood: how to verify whether a given network reroutes flows along feasible paths, without violating capacity constraints, for up to k link failures? We chart the algorithmic complexity landscape of resilient routing under link failures, considering shortest path routing based on link weights as e.g. deployed in the ECMP protocol. We study two models: a pessimistic model where flows interfere in a worst-case manner along equal-cost shortest paths, and an optimistic model where flows are routed in a best-case manner, and we present a complete picture of the algorithmic complexities.We further propose a strategic search algorithm that checks only the critical failure scenarios while still providing correctness guarantees.

            "text": "Routing and traffic engineering are most fundamental tasks in a communication network. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) today use several sophisticated strategies to efficiently provision their backbone network to serve intra-domain traffic. This is challenging as in addition to simply providing reachability, routing protocols should also account for capacity constraints: to meet quality-ofservice guarantees, congestion must be avoided. Intra-domain routing protocols are usually based on shortest paths, and in particular the Equal-Cost-MultiPath (ECMP) protocol [24] . Flows are split at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to the destination, based on per-flow static hashing [7, 30] . In addition to default routing, most modern communication networks also provide support for resilient routing: upon the detection of a link failure, the network nodes quickly and collaboratively recompute the new shortest paths [21] .",

            "text": "However, today, we still do not have a good understanding of the algorithmic complexity of shortest path routing subject to capacity constraints, especially under failures. In particular, in this paper we are interested in the basic question: \"Given a capacitated network based on shortest path routing (defined by link weights), can the network tolerate up to k link failures without violating capacity constraints?\" Surprisingly only little is known about the complexity aspects. Our Contributions. We provide a complete characterization of the algorithmic complexity landscape of resilient routing and introduce two basic models of how traffic is distributed across the multiple shortest paths. A pessimistic (P) one where flows add up in a worst-case manner; if a network is resilient in the pessimistic model, it is guaranteed that routing succeeds along any shortest path without overloading links. In the optimistic (O) model flows add up in a bestcase manner; if a network is resilient in the optimistic model, it may be that the specific routing does not overload the links. The two models hence cover the two extremes in the spectrum and alternative routing schemes, e.g., (pseudo)random routing hence lies in between. Figure 1 illustrates the situations that can arise in a network: depending on the scenario, pessimistic (P) or optimistic (O), and whether the routing feasibility test is positive or negative, we can distinguish between three regimes. (1) If routing is feasible even in the pessimistic case, then flows can be safely forwarded by any routing policy without violating any capacity constraints. (2) If the pessimistic test is negative but positive in the optimistic case, then further considerations are required to ensure that flows use the feasible paths (e.g., a clever routing algorithm to find the suitable paths is needed). (3) If even the optimistic test is negative then no feasible routing solution exists; to be able to successfully route flows in this case, we need to change the network characteristics, e.g., to increase the link capacities. We further distinguish between splittable (S) and nonsplittable (N) flows, and refer to the four possible problems by PS, PN, ON, and OS. Our main complexity results are summarized in Figure 2 . We can see that without link failures (Figure 2a ), the problems are solvable in polynomial time, except for the ON problem that becomes NP-complete. Moreover, the pessimistic variants of the problem can be solved even in nondeterministic logarithmic space, implying that they allow for efficient parallelization [33] . On the other hand, the optimistic splittable problem is hard for the class P. For the problems with link failures ( Figure 2b ) the complexity increases and the problems become co-NPcomplete, apart from the ON problem that becomes more difficult to solve and is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy [33] .",

We present an efficient strategic search algorithm implementing these ideas, formally prove its correctness, and demonstrate the practical applicability of strategic search on a benchmark of Internet and datacenter topologies. In particular, we find that our algorithm achieves up to several orders of magnitude runtime savings compared to the brute-force search.",

Efficient traffic routing has received much attention in the literature, and there also exist empirical studies on the efficiency of ECMP deployments, e.g., in Internet Service Provider Networks [17] or in datacenters [22] . A systematic algorithmic study of routing with ECMP is conducted by Chiesa et al. in [10] . The authors show that in the splittable-flow model [16] , even approximating the optimal link-weight configuration for ECMP within any constant factor is computationally intractable. Before their work, it was only known that minimizing congestion is NP-hard (even to just provide \"satisfactory\" quality [2] and also under path cardinality constraints [5] ) and cannot be approximated within a factor of 3/2 [19] . For specific topologies the authors further show that traffic engineering with ECMP remains suboptimal and computationally hard for hypercube networks. We significantly extend these insights into the algorithmic complexity of traffic engineering and introduce the concept of pessimistic and optimistic variants of routing feasibility and provide a complete characterization of the complexity of routing subject to capacity constraints, also in scenarios with failures. Accounting for failures is an important aspect in practice [13, 31] but has not been studied rigorously in the literature before; to the best of our knowledge, so far there only exist heuristic solutions [18] with some notable exceptions such as Lancet [8] (which however does not account for congestion). We propose to distinguish between optimistic and pessimistic flow splitting; existing literature typically revolves around the optimistic scenario.",

For a given quantified formula, we shall construct an instance of the ON problem such that the formula is valid if and only if the ON problem with up to m link failures (where m is the number of y-variables) has a positive answer. The reduction uses the construction from Theorem 8 where we described a reduction from the validity of the formula \u2203x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x k . \u03d5. The construction is further enhanced by introducing new nodes y j , y j , e j and new edges of capacity 2n (where n is the number of clauses) such that C(y j , y j ) = C(y j , e j ) = 2n, for all i, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Now for every clause c i we add the so-called m-unbreakable edge of capacity n from c s i to y j and from e j to c e i for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Moreover, whenever the literal y j appears in the clause c i , we also add an m-unbreakable edge from y j to c e i and whenever the literal y j appears in the clause c i , we add m-unbreakable edge from c s i to y j . The construction of m-unbreakable edges (denoted by double arrows) is given in Figure 4c where the capacity of each link is set to n. Finally, for each j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, we add the unbreakable edges from s 1 to y j and from e j to s k . The flow demands in the newly constructed network are identical to those from the proof of Theorem 8 and the weights of all newly added edges are set to 1 and we set the weight of the two links s 0 to x 1 and s 0 to x 1 to 6. The reduction can be clearly done in polynomial time. Figure 4b demonstrates an extension of the construction from Figure 4a with additional nodes and links that complete the reduction. Observe, that even in case of m link failures, the unbreakable links that consist of m + 1 edge disjoint paths are still capable of carrying all the necessary flow traffic.",

The opposite direction where the formula is not valid means that there is a truth assignment to the y-variables so that irrelevant of the assignment for x-variables there is at least one clause that is not satisfied.

To demonstrate this, we present a novel strategic search algorithm for verifying the feasibility of shortest path routing under failures. At the heart of our algorithm lies the idea to reduce the number of explored failure scenarios by skipping the \"uninteresting\" ones. Let us fix an NCD N = (V, C, D) with the weight assignment W .

Hence for the pessimistic scenario, the idea of strategic search is to ignore failure scenarios that remove only some of the shortest paths but preserve at least one of such shortest paths. For the optimistic scenario, we on the other hand explore only the maximal failure scenarios where removing one additional link causes the removal of all shortest paths for at least one source and destination.",

There can be several incomparable minimum cuts (with the same number of edges) and by mincut size(spg s,t F , s, t) we denote the number of edges in each the minimum cuts from the set min cuts(spg s,t F , s, t). Algorithm 3 now presents our fast search strategy, called strategic search. The input to the algorithm is the same as for the brute-force search. The algorithm initializes the pending set of failure scenarios to be explored to the empty failure scenario and it remembers the set of passed failure scenarios that were already verified. In the main while loop, a failure scenario F is removed from the pending set and depending on the type \u03c4 of the problem, we either directly verify the scenario F in the case of the pessimistic problems, or we call the function MaxFailureCheck (F ) that instead verifies all maximal failure scenarios F such that F \u227a F .

To model demands, for each topology, we consider certain nodes to serve as core nodes which have significant pairwise demands.

In our evaluation, we filter out the trivial instances where the runtime is less than 0.1 second for both the brute-force and strategic search (as some of the instances e.g. contain a disconnected flow demand already without any failed links). The benchmark contains a mixture of both positive and negative instances for each problem for increasing number k of failed links.

For more difficult instances, the difference in runtime continues to grow exponentially, and becomes several orders of magnitude. For datacenter networks (right), the difference is even larger. The latter can be explained by the fact that datacenters provide a higher path diversity and multiple shortest paths between source and target nodes and hence more opportunities for a clever skipping of \"uninteresting instances\".

While our paper charts the complete landscape, there remain several interesting avenues for future research like further scalability improvements and a parallelization of the algorithm.",
