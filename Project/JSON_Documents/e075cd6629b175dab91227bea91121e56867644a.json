            "text": "Intuitionistic fuzzy distance measurement is an effective method to study multi-attribute emergency decision-making (MAEDM) problems. Unfortunately, the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance measurement method cannot accurately reflect the difference between membership and non-membership data, where it is easy to cause information confusion. Therefore, from the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), this paper constructs a decision-making model based on intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy and a comprehensive grey correlation analysis algorithm. For the MAEDM problems of completely unknown and partially known attribute weights, this method establishes a grey correlation analysis algorithm based on the objective evaluation value and subjective preference value of decision makers (DMs), which makes up for the shortcomings of traditional model information loss and greatly improves the accuracy of MAEDM. Finally, taking the Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12th 2008 as a case study, this paper constructs and solves the ranking problem of shelters. Through the sensitivity comparison analysis, when the grey resolution coefficient increases from 0.4 to 1.0, the ranking result of building shelters remains stable. Compared to the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance, this method is shown to be more reliable.",

            "text": "At present, earthquakes, fires, novel coronavirus infections, and other frequent disasters have caused great loss to human beings. Owing to the uncertainty and fuzziness of such emergency problems, it is difficult for decision makers (DMs) to determine alternatives with real numbers to make quick decisions. The accurate processing of information has become an unavoidable problem in the development of the emergency decision [1] [2] [3] field. Under this urgent demand, fuzzy set theory, which can deal well with the uncertainty of decision-making problems, came into being [4] . Fuzzy sets [5, 6] use membership as a single scale to reflect the support and opposition of DMs to objective things. However, with the development of decision theory, it is difficult to accurately describe the uncertainty of objective things by fuzzy sets alone. Based on this, Atanassov, a Bulgarian professor, put forward the concept of the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) in the 1980s [7, 8] . He used membership degree and non-membership degree to express the support, opposition, and hesitation of decision information. Compared to the fuzzy set, the IFS can describe the natural attributes of objective things more accurately [9] [10] [11] .",

In recent years, scholars have made great progress in the research of intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (IFMADM). The similarity measure is one of the most important decision-making methods in IFMADM. Xu et al. [15] systematically analyzed the similarity measurement formula based on geometric distance, set theory, and intuitionistic fuzzy matching degree. In order to improve the measurement accuracy of the similarity of the IFS, Park et al. [16] and Hu et al. [17] used the similarity measurement formula based on intuitionistic fuzzy entropy for the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) and interval IFN, respectively, and optimized the alternatives. The IFS can represent the uncertainty of decision information well, but there are some difficulties in data comparison. Score function and precise function are effective means for data comparison and ranking in IFMADM. Chen et al. [18] were the first experts to study the score function of the IFN. They used the difference between membership and non-membership in the IFN to construct a function to compare the size relationship of the IFN, which is the basis of IFMADM. On the basis of score function, Hong et al. [19] proposed an intuitionistic fuzzy precise function, which greatly improved the efficiency of decision-making. The classical multi-attribute method has a wide range of development and application in the field of intuitionistic fuzzy. Table 1 summarizes some main methods of IFMADM. Table 1 .

[28] Regret theory Unfortunately, natural disasters, such as fires and floods, often lead to unexpected and disastrous consequences. A large number of emergency decision-making problems have evolved into MADM. Up to now, domestic and foreign scholars have conducted in-depth research in this field. Xu et al. [29] proposed a two-stage method to support the consensus-building process of large-scale MADMand applied it to earthquake shelter selection. Taking a fire and explosion accident as the study, Xu et al. [30] defined a generalized asymmetric language D number and proposed the corresponding MADM fusion algorithm, which verified the effectiveness of the method. Li et al. [31] proposed a risk decision analysis method based on the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and MADM) method to solve the emergency evacuation problem of tourist attractions, in which the attribute value and the probability of state occurrence are in the interval number format. This method solves this kind of emergency decision-making problem well, which shows that it is more effective than the traditional method. Based on an example of ship collision, Xiong et al. [32] used two intelligent algorithms, multi-attribute differential evolution algorithm and non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm, to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model. From the prediction model of the triple exponential smoothing method, Wang et al. [33] proposed an MADM additive weighting method, weighted product method, and elimination selection transformation reality method to sort the recycled electric vehicles, which provided an effective solution for managers and researchers in the electric vehicle industry and improved the efficiency of the electric vehicle industry. For the multi-attribute group decision-making problem of community sustainable development emergency response, Wu et al. [34] proposed a method based on subjective imprecise estimation of the reliability of binary language vocabulary, which greatly improved the efficiency of MADM. Karimi et al. [35] introduced the best and worst algorithm to solve the MADM problem in the fuzzy environment and applied this method to the evaluation of hospital maintenance, which proves the satisfactory performance of this method. Based on the above analysis, the MADM method is widely used in the field of emergency decision-making, which can solve the uncertainty well in the case of emergency.

First, the average information entropy of intuitionistic fuzzy is defined, and the measurement method of cross-entropy distance of intuitionistic fuzzy is given. On this basis, considering the unknown and known attribute weights, an optimization model with the subjective preference of the DMs is established and solved. Secondly, the intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix is obtained according to the objective attribute evaluation of DMs. The intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy distance matrix is constructed by combining the objective evaluation value and subjective preference value of alternatives. Then, the attribute weight is determined according to the adjusted intuitionistic fuzzy average information entropy. By using the method of grey correlation analysis, the comprehensive grey relation coefficient of each alternative is obtained, and the order of alternatives is generated. Therefore, a new method is proposed to solve the MAEDM problem by using intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy and grey correlation analysis. The important contributions of this paper are mainly reflected in six aspects. (1) The intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy distance is defined. (2) A multi-attribute emergency decision with subjective preference is considered. (3) The uncertainty of attribute weight is discussed and solved by intuitionistic fuzzy information entropy. (4) The grey correlation analysis method is applied to MAEDM, which makes full use of decision-making information such as membership, non-membership, and hesitation. (5) According to the grey resolution coefficient, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to verify the reliability and stability of the decision results. (6) Compared to the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance, this method is shown to be more stable.",
