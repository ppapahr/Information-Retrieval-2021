Within days, a cluster of over 90 linked cases emerged as family members, friends, and neighbors of the index case (Patient Zero) as well as healthcare workers that treated the patient tested positive (Goldstein & Salcedo 2020) . From March 16 th -July 22 nd , the total number of cases in New York exceeded any other state (data.cdc.gov) despite voluntary quarantine measures enacted shortly after the index case tested positive, bans on large gatherings (March 12 th ; Cuomo 2020a), restaurant, bar (March 16 th ; Cuomo 2020b), and school (March 18 th ; Cuomo 2020c) closures, and the shuttering of all non-essential businesses (March 22 nd ; Cuomo 2020d). However, daily case counts dropped dramatically by late April and from early June through November, New York sustained a percent positivity rate that hovered around 1% (despite increased testing). This was largely attributable to March 22 nd on-pause measures and widespread adherence to face-mask and social distancing policies although the positivity rate has risen subsequently to the writing of this manuscript.",

Here, we attempt to clarify the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics across New York State with additional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples from almost every county of New York. We identified regional variation and a shift over time in SARS-CoV-2 community composition with the Westchester outbreak contributing to the dominance of the B.1 lineage. The data suggest that after the initial surge of cases in early spring, the strict on-pause measures implemented were largely effective at curbing widespread transmission into early Autumn.",

TreeCluster attempts to incorporate evolutionary distances and tree topology into defining transmission clusters with the threshold-free approach identifying a distance that maximizes the number of clusters with more than one member (Balaban et al. 2019) . We tested other TreeCluster algorithms, but the threshold-free approach was the most conservative -yielding more clusters with fewer individuals (i.e. less diversity within a cluster). Although this approach showed evidence of breaking known larger transmission chains into multiple clusters (such as cases associated with the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Westchester County), we chose to be conservative because we lacked associated epidemiological information for most of our samples. As a comparison, we also included the results of the single-linkage min-cut partitioning strategy, which finds the closest leaf outside a subtree and only cuts the pair of nodes if their distance does not exceed a user-specified threshold (0.00068) (Balaban et al. 2019) . This algorithm led to larger clusters with more diversity and fewer sequences that lacked a cluster association, capturing deeper relationships within the tree as opposed to the tips. We also chose to include smaller transmission chains (fewer than five individuals) because they often showed inter-regional membership. Trees and annotations were visualized in Llama v.0.1 (https://cov-lineages.org/llama.html) placed all New York sequences generated by the Wadsworth Center within a global phylogeny of >70,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated by Dr. Rob Lanfear (downloaded on 7/27/2020, https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/). Llama incorporates query sequences into the global phylogeny and returns a subtree of closely related sequences. These contextual sequences assisted us in determining whether transmission clusters were seeded locally or via non-New York sources and were employed downstream in phylogeographic analyses.",

The mean pairwise distance (mpd) and mean nearest taxon distance (mntd) functions determined the presence of phylogenetic structuring within each region (more or less divergence than expected by chance). Both functions calculate average distances among taxa within a community (all pairwise distances or the shortest distances) and compare the expected amount of phylogenetic relatedness against a null distribution (Webb et al. 2008 ) generated from 1000 community randomizations. Mpd is believed to capture community structure more deeply within the tree while the mntd identifies structure closer to the tips .

These methods rely on a phylogenetic tree to measure evolutionary divergence between communities with the weighted method incorporating abundance information as well. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac tests can be employed to understand different aspects driving community structure (Lozupone et al. 2007 ). The weighted UniFrac test detects shifts in relative abundances between communities while the unweighted test is suited to identifying founding populations (Lozupone et al. 2007 ). Whether regions display significantly different viral communities is evaluated by randomizing the communities on the tree and recalculating UniFrac distances to determine the proportion of trees with a distance greater than or equal to the observed data. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing by the false discovery rate (FDR) with the p.adjust function in R.",

Included in the first two analyses were the earliest sequences from the Westchester outbreak (from individuals known to be directly associated with the index), representatives from a subset of New York B.1.X transmission clusters (as defined by the threshold-free approach in TreeCluster), a subset of \"contextual\" sequences obtained from Nextstrain builds (including the earliest B.1 genomes identified in Europe and the United States), and genomes identified by Llama as putatively derived from out-of-state transmission. Two independent runs were performed with representatives from 116/303 or 94/303 B.1.X transmission clusters that spanned the diversity of B.1.X lineages in New York. The third analysis included the earliest representatives from each B.1.X threshold-free transmission cluster that appeared between March and July (n=259, excluding some that were consistently identified as out-of-state introductions by the first two analyses), the index genome and those with an epidemiological link, and a subset of genomes from the United States and Europe. Non-New York B.1.X genomes were randomly selected between February to July from GISAID, with the number of genomes sampled each month approximately equal to those of New York for a total of 596 sequences (more genomes were randomly sampled from the United States as reduced transmission between countries after nationwide lockdowns made international importations less likely (Magalis et al. 2020)). All analyses were run under an HKY nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distribution and four rate categories. The clock rate was fixed at 8x10 -04 substitutions per site per year (Nie et al. 2020; Rambaut, Andrew 2020 ) under a normal prior with standard deviation set to 1x10 -05 . Runs were monitored for convergence in Tracer v.1.7.1 (Rambaut et al. 2018) and stopped when effective sample sizes were \u00b3 200 for all parameters. Maximum clade credibility trees were generated by TreeAnnotator v.2.6.2 (Bouckaert et al. 2019; Heled & Bouckaert 2013) with a 10% burn-in and node heights equal to the common ancestor (in order to avoid negative branch lengths). BALTIC (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic) identified all New York sequences that descended from a non-New York node. Hamming distances, the number of substitutions between pairs of sequences excluding ambiguous positions and gaps, were calculated with snpdists v. 0.7.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists) to determine the median number of differences between genomes putatively linked to the Westchester outbreak and those independently introduced to New York State.",

The B.1 lineage was geographically and temporally ubiquitous while others displayed a more checkered appearance ( Figure 2 ). For example, the B.1.2 lineage was significantly associated with the North Country (c 2 test p-value < 2.2x10 -16 ), which harbored more than half of the B.1.2 genomes but contributed to less than 3% of the total dataset (Supplementary Table 2 ). Similarly, there was a significant association between Western New York and the B.1.1 lineage (c 2 test, p-value < 2.2x10 -16 ). SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Western New York comprised only 4.5% of the dataset (supplementary Table 2 ) but 30% of B.1.1 genomes derived from this region. The observed regional associations of some lineages could be due to biased and limited sampling. However, the North Country represents the most robustly sampled region in the dataset with four percent of the positive cases sequenced (Supplementary Table 2 ). Although four B.1.2 genomes were linked to a senior living facility, several genomes appeared to be sampled from the greater community. Less than one percent of the positive cases from Western New York were sequenced (Supplementary Table 2 ), but the wide distribution of sample ages suggests B.1.1 might have been the dominant lineage circulating in the general population. Thus, despite sampling limitations, some regions appear to be characterized by SARS-CoV-2 lineages that were less representative of the entire state, implicating localized viral transmission as a greater influence on SARS-CoV-2 composition than inter-regional spread.",

This is particularly apparent by June-September, where sequence diversity is solely concentrated in the B.1.X portion of the tree (Figure 2 ). This does not take into account the more limited sequencing that occurred during later months, which might hinder the ability to detect variants circulating at low frequency. In fact, three regions with the greatest number of lineages in March (New York City, Mid-Hudson, and Long Island) had no data available for various later months (as of the time of writing). The number of lineages detected per month was significantly correlated with the number of samples sequenced (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r=0.74, p-value=3.9x10 -08 ) and randomly down-sampling earlier months (March and April) to the size of May and June datasets revealed significant decreases in the number of lineages identified (one-sample t-test p-values < 2.2x10 -16 ). However, rarefaction analyses demonstrated that while lineages continued to be identified as more regions were sampled for March and April, lineage richness remained essentially flat or unchanged for May and June-September (Supplementary Figure 1) , which suggests that sampling bias did not substantially influence the underlying loss of diversity observed.",

Genomes from the outbreak in Westchester County were assigned to the B.1 lineage and the Nextstrain 20C clade based upon sequences from the index case and those with direct affiliation to Patient Zero. The genome of the index case and those of the 20C clade deviate from the Wuhan-1 reference by six mutations: C241T, C3037T, C14408T, A23403G, C1059T, and G25563T. The first four mutations characterize the B.1 lineage while G25563T was present in the 20C parent lineage circulating in Europe by January and February 2020. The C1059T mutation is present in only one other genome collected in the United States prior to March, making It possible that most genomes with this signature mutation are derived from the initial Westchester outbreak. However, the threshold-free approach separated SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Westchester outbreak into at least four clusters (based on the phylogenetic position of the index and epidemiologically linked genomes) that contained a total of 251 sequences, spanned 20 counties (12 upstate), and lasted from March 2 until early May 2020 (Figure3). The index genome fell within a clade of 181 identical sequences, which deviated from the genomes in the other three clusters by 1 SNP (excluding ambiguous positions led to identical sequences among the two largest clusters). The SARS-CoV-2 genome from a known epidemiologically linked case to the index was part of a separate transmission cluster and deviated from that of the index by a single SNP not detected in any other New York genome examined. This raises the possibility that there are other genomes related to the outbreak that were not included in our estimate.",

The Westchester outbreak as defined by the single-linkage algorithm and the placement of the index genome contained 877 sequences, spanned 43 counties (32 upstate) and lasted 92 days ( Figure 3 ). There was a median Hamming distance of two between genomes of this cluster, consistent with results for linked genomes in previous analyses (Dearlove et al. 2020) . This suggests that the initial community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Westchester County was responsible for at least 13.5% to 47% of the cases represented in our dataset and 30-60% of all cases affiliated with a transmission cluster, with widespread distribution across the state.

These results appear to capture the dynamics of the Westchester outbreak as well as upstate SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Sequences from upstate could be found interspersed throughout the New York State phylogeny -in predominantly downstate clades, such as the Westchester outbreak and in regionally specific clades -leading to larger distances among SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these communities ( Figure 4 ). While outbreaks downstate (such as the one in Westchester County) contributed to seeding upstate transmission chains, the effects of upstate transmission to downstate appear minimal. The sparse sampling of New York City, Long Island, and the Mid-Hudson after May might also contribute to the pattern observed and prevents us from evaluating the full extent of SARS-CoV-2 exchange between the two areas. Sequences from upstate regions span all months considered and therefore encompass a greater proportion of the evolution that has occurred along the New York phylogeny ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, the diversity detected downstate is largely confined to the early months of the pandemic in New York State (Figure 4 ).",

Stratifying by month uncovered a more complicated pattern, where viral communities became generally more distinct as a function of time ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 5 ). This could be due to limited travel within New York and between New York and other states after March, which restricted SARS-CoV-2 transmission to more regional or even county-level scales. Results could also be influenced by differences in sampling strategies between months, with broader surveillance efforts in earlier months and an increased focus on outbreaks after May. However, transmission dynamics had also changed by May, with the number of infections declining drastically and localized outbreaks comprising a larger proportion of positive cases. For example, the percentage of transmission clusters composed of genomes from more than one region declined from 29% in March to 4% in May. By June, no clusters contained genomes from more than one region, suggesting on-pause measures were largely effective, although the New York City metropolitan area was severely under-sampled. Regardless, this trend is similar to the dynamics identified at the global level, which showed a decline in the number and size of transmission clusters as well as the number of multi-country clusters after the implementation of national lockdowns and travel restrictions (Magalis et al. 2020).",

Given these results and the fact that 94% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in New York State were of B.1 ancestry, the epidemic appeared to be fueled largely by within-state viral transmission after various initial introductions.

A total of 258 clusters, representing 981 genomes were represented, of which 69 clusters representing 429 genomes or 44% of all New York sequences in the analysis were related to the Westchester outbreak (not including two possible re-importation events). At a minimum, this would indicate that approximately 23% of all genomes in the entire New York dataset (429/1859) were linked to the Westchester outbreak. There was a median Hamming distance of one substitution between members of Westchester-affiliated clusters (n=429) and a median distance of four substitutions between these genomes and the rest of the dataset (n=981). We then calculated Hamming distances for 100 random samples of B.1.X sequences from Europe, the United States, and the Westchester outbreak (n=200 genomes) between March and May. The median Hamming distance between Westchester-related genomes and global representatives was also four (Supplementary Figure 5) . These distances are fairly consistent with previous analyses, which found a median Hamming distance of 2 between epidemiologically linked samples and five substitutions between all globally sampled genomes (n=12814) through May with a D614G mutation (Dearlove et al. 2020).",

The least conservative estimates (Supplementary Figure 4) are similar to the proportion of genomes associated with a superspreading event in Massachusetts (Lemieux et al. 2020) . Even less conservatively, the Westchester outbreak would be responsible for over >76% of New York SARS-CoV-2 infections if we consider the founding of the 20C clade in the state to be a single event synonymous with the Westchester outbreak based on the defining C1059T mutation and the lack of other genomes with this signature in the United States prior to March (except one). However, our conclusions are tempered by several factors. As the number of clusters and non-New York samples increased, the number of cases associated with the Westchester outbreak decreased, highlighting the sensitivity of phylogeographic analyses to sampling strategy, particularly in the face of limited genetic diversity (Lemey et al. 2020; Frost et al. 2015) . While the number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and the clusters associated with importation events were generally consistent among the three analyses, fluctuations were observed. For example, the ancestral locations associated with B.1.2 transmission clusters changed from New York to America/USA as more closely related sequences and earlier sampled cases from other states were added (Supplementary Figure 4) . Further, the phylogenetic positions of key genomes might be relatively uninformative as the small internal branch lengths and subsequent low posterior probabilities for splits within the 20C clade essentially transform it into a star phylogeny. While this could be interpreted as the rapid expansion of the Westchester outbreak it might also reflect the rapid global dissemination .

The analysis shows the widespread distribution of the B.1 lineage and its increase in relative abundance through time, recapitulating the global trend (Korber et al. 2020; van Dorp et al. 2020 ). Both community structure and phylogeographic analyses suggest that a large proportion of B.1.X transmission clusters were due to within-state transmission and were related to the initial Westchester outbreak in March. From there, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to other downstate regions (New York City, Long Island, and other Mid-Hudson counties) and various counties of upstate New York. Indeed, the only counties that showed little relation to the initial outbreak were in the Western region of the state, but there are certainly many unsampled transmission chains. Results from phylogeographic and community structure analyses also showed downstate as a potential transmission hub. The index case associated with the Westchester outbreak had attended large religious gatherings before being confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Although around 1,000 people affiliated with the index patient were asked to self-quarantine (Jones & Maxouris 2020) and additional measures were implemented thereafter, the geographic and temporal breadth as well as the high membership of the Westchester outbreak -defined by threshold-free, single-linkage or phylogeographic strategies -underscore the consequences of even small delays in containment efforts and the disproportionate contribution large congregate settings can have in spreading the virus. However, the limited divergence of the virus combined with rapid transmission rates and under-sampling may obscure underlying sources of transmission ascribed to a single outbreak event (Worobey et al. 2020). While quantifying the number of cases related to the Westchester outbreak may not be truly possible, our application of multiple strategies to assess its impact demonstrates the importance of rapidly implementing containment measures.",

Regions that did not have significantly different SARS-CoV-2 communities (as determined by unweighted UniFrac tests), are connected by a line. Green lines are connections between downstate regions and those of upstate. Blue lines signify connections between upstate regions. While all downstate regions have at least one connection to upstate regions (except Western New York), the SARS-CoV-2 communities of many upstate regions do not appear similar. b) Dendrogram generated from Jaccard distances of shared transmission clusters among New York counties. Only counties with five sequences in one or more transmission cluster were considered. The dendrogram highlights the cohesive group formed by downstate counties. Several counties from upstate group by region but there are also outliers, suggesting transmission chains are less extensive in these areas than in the interconnected New York City metropolitan area (The five boroughs of New York City and surrounding counties).
