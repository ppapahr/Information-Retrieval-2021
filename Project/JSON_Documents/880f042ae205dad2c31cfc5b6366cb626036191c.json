These transgenic animals can therefore now be used to study several critical aspects of the physiological regulation of insulin gene expression, including the mechanisms controlling serum insulin and total f3-cell insulin levels. Because at least one additional insulin gene is being expressed in the transgenic mice and total insulin RNA and protein levels are approximately the same as in control mice, the question of dosage compensation can be investigated. Moreover, our tolbutamide results indicate that drugs thought to affect human insulin metabolism can now be tested in an in vivo animal system.

            "text": "Genetic recombination of DNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the evolution of DNA-based organisms and results in their diversity and adaptability. The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses l -4, it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive-and negative-strand virusesS--9 and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus lO and coronavirus ll \u2022 However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3' end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants.",

            "text": "Genetic recombination of DNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the evolution of DNA-based organisms and results in their diversity and adaptability. The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses l -4, it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive-and negative-strand virusesS--9 and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus lO and coronavirus ll \u2022 However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3' end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants. 1 Schematic representation of the postulated conformation of the tRNA-like structure at the 3' end of BMV RNA3 (after Rietveld et al. '4) . The open box indicates the location of the 20-nucleotide deletion (deletion m4) so that the entire D arm is absent from the resulting structure. This deletion, located between nucleotides 81 and 100, was originally introduced into a cDNA clone comprising the last 200 bases of BMV RNA3 as described in ref. 19 and subsequently transferred into the full-length cDNA clone of BMV RNA3 as described in ref. 21 .",

As with animal RNA viruses, the mechanism of recombination between the BMV sequences is unknown. Two diverse mechanisms have been suggested for RNA genomes: (1) Enzymatic cutting and re-ligation. (2) A 'copy-choice', during replication, between adventitiously proximal templates. The latter mechanism has been favoured for recombination in picornaviruses 24 , negativestrand viruses 5 ,10 and alpha viruses 7 . The recent discoveries of remarkable sequence similarities among encoded proteins of diverse plant RNA viruses 25 ,26 suggest that recombination may be a common phenomenon during synthesis of plant viruses. Like other processes of natural mutagenesis, recombination between plant viruses may render the progeny more adaptable to new environments or hosts. Conversely, RNA recombination between plant viral RNAs may be important for the preservation and stabilization of crucial functional sequences of multipartite genome viruses. Because it facilitates the association of unrelated genes, recombination also represents an attractive candidate for the mechanism of origin of viruses and for the insertion of new genes into existing viruses.

Mutant A was obtained from plant I; mutants B-E were identified in plants II and III. The figure shows the 3' region of RNA3 for the five mutants downstream to the coat protein open reading frames (ORFs). The open regions adjacent to the ORFs represent wild-type BMY RNA3 sequences. The cross-hatching indicates regions identical to wild-type RNAI or RNA2, possessing the stem-and-Ioop region of arm D, and also differing from wild-type RNA3 at the following base positions: RNAI has distinctive bases at positions 101,44 and 43 while RNA2 has distinctive bases at positions 101 and 44 and has a point deletion corresponding to base 74 ofRNA3(refs 13,20). The boxes enclose regions in which the recombination event occurred, assuming a recombination mechanism involving a single event. Sequences of wild-type RNAs 1, 2 and 3 are identical in these regions. Methods. Mutant A RNA3 was sequenced directly by a chaintemination (dideoxy) technique with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase 30 \u2022 Briefly, 2 I-lg of RNA3, obtained after fractionation on a sucrose gradiene l , was hybridized with 1 I-lg of either the IS-mer d( GAGA ITITCTCTGGT), complementary to nucleotide positIOns 1-15, or the IS-mer d(TCTCACAGATCCTCG), complementary to nucleotides 129-143, and these primers were extended with 10 units of reverse transcriptase (Life Science) in the presence of dideoxy nucleoside triphosphates. RNA3 preparations obtained from plants II and III (mutants B-E) were sequenced as cDNA clones in an M13mpl9 vector by a chain-termination (dideoxy) technique with a synthetic 17-mer primer (BioLabs) and DNA polymerase large fragment (Klenow)32.33. Two cDNA libraries were created for BMY RNA3 preparations obtained either from primary infection in plant II or after a second passage of the virus in plant III. The first cDNA strand was synthesized with reverse transcriptase as described elsewhere 34 , using the d(TAGAGAITITCTCTGGT) primer complementary to the last 17 nucleotides of BMY RNA3. After purification on a 1 x 20 cm Sepharose CL2B column, the second strand was obtained by means of a replacement reaction with RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase and E. coli DNA ligase 35 . After treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (blunt-ending), the resulting double-stranded cDNA preparation was cloned into a SmaI restriction site of M13ampl9 vector and the sequence of the corresponding single-stranded M13 DNA templates was determined by a chain-termination procedure using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase and a synthetic 17-mer (BioLabs) as primer.",

These proteins accumulate in the intercellular leaf space 1 ,2. The appearance of pathogenesisrelated (PR) proteins is closely associated with the phenomenon of 'systemic acquired resistance' and it has been suggested that such proteins have an antiviral function 3 ,4. Previously, we cloned complementary DNAs to the messenger RNAs for the three smallest PR proteins, PR-la, -lb and -Ie, and these clones were used to show that there is an increase of more than 100-fold in the concentration of PR-l mRNAs following TMV infection of tobaccos,6. Here, we describe the cDNA cloning of another mRNA whose synthesis is induced by TMV infection. Sequencing of the cDNA showed that the encoded protein is highly homologous to thaumatin, the intensely sweet-tasting protein from the fruits of the monocot Thaumatococcus daniellii Benth, a West African rainforest shrub. The conservation of a gene encoding a thaumatinlike protein in tobacco suggests that the encoded protein may have a more general function than that of being sweet-tasting.Poly(A)-containing RNA from TMV-infected Samsun NN tobacco was used as a template to construct a cDNA library; 1,400 transformants were screened by a differential hybridization procedure, using 32P-Iabelled DNA complementary to poly(A) RNA from healthy or TMV-infected tobacco as probes. Forty transformants were found to correspond to TMV-induced mRNAs and an analysis of their inserts showed that they could be divided into six clusters, with cross-hybridization occurring within but not between the clusters. Details of the cloning and selection procedure will be given elsewhere (R.A.M.H. et ai., in preparation).",
