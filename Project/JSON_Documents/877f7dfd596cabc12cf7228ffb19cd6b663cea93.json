The incubation period is 1 to 14 days (mean: 5-6 days) in most cases, but can be 92 as long as 24 days. 1 The most commonly seen characteristics of COVID-19 are fever, cough and 93 abnormal chest computed tomography (CT). 2, 3 At present, the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is 94 thought to be the origin of SARS-CoV-2 based on sequence homology of 96% between 95 SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13. 4 , 5 The pangolin has been proposed as an intermediate host, 96 but this has not been confirmed. 6, 7 Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs 97 mainly via respiratory droplets, 1 direct contact, 1 asymptomatic transmission, 8, 9 and intrafamilial Managing the spread of the epidemic 128 The most important strategy to combat a pandemic is to prevent it from even happening. This shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), which was mitigated by using reserve 210 supplies, acquiring donations, and production increases (Appendix 1 and Figure S1 ). Wuhan is shown in Figure 2 . Table S1 . 240 Emergency staffing was arranged as needed within a half hour. do not require supplemental oxygen, and hyperoxemia may induce further respiratory 306 injury and even higher mortality. 29 The indications for supplemental oxygen should be Pharmacologic agents 345 We summarize the treatment of 327 pooled cases of severe cases with COVID-19 ( (Table 3) . 10, 36 365 interferon-\u03b12b inhalation, 17 (28%) patients received arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir, and 8 (13%) 369 received interferon-\u03b12b by inhalation. 37 Chen et al reported that 75 of 99 confirmed patients in 370 Wuhan received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, and lopinavir and 371 ritonavir. 38 The duration of antiviral treatment was 3-14 days. 38 15 Zhou et al proposed that hydroxychloroquine could serve as a better therapeutic agent than 400 chloroquine due to reduced toxicity, fewer side effects, lower cost and relative safety in 401 pregnancy. 47 Yao et al used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models and found 402 that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 403 They recommended hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 404 mg twice daily for 4 days to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. 48 The efficacy and safety data of 405 chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed. A retrospective study found that low-to-moderate dose glucocorticoid therapy had no effect 419 on the time to viral clearance in patients with COVID-19. Glucocorticoids are not recommended 420 in mild cases because there was no improvement in the rate of radiographic recovery. 52 However, 421 a single-center in Wuhan shared that early, low-dose and short-term (1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days) 422 corticosteroids was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of 423 focal lung lesions in severe cases of COVID-19. 53 Another study analyzed 15 critical cases and 424 suggested that a low dose and short duration of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone <1 mg/kg, 425 less than 7 days) may be beneficial for critically ill patients with COVID-19. 54 Vaccine development 489 The development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has been accelerated as a priority project. improve sample collection and the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection. 77 The 513 patients' position should be assessed and changed regularly to avoid decubitus skin injury. Due to the fact that cardiac insufficiency can lead to a coagulation disorder and that severe 533 COVID-19 patients were reported to have increased level of D-dimer, low molecular weight 534 heparin was recommended to treat COVID-19 patients in the early phase of disease. 81 As in 535 SARS-CoV, ACE2 has similarly been identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. 82 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 167, "text": "91", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 286, "end": 287, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 404, "end": 406, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 407, "end": 408, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 572, "end": 573, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 576, "end": 577, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 634, "end": 636, "text": "96", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 670, "end": 672, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 673, "end": 674, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 807, "end": 809, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 810, "end": 811, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 866, "end": 869, "text": "128", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1180, "text": "240", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1366, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1441, "text": "345", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1536, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1539, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1688, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1748, "text": "370", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1856, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1910, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1913, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2117, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2294, "text": "403", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2448, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2854, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3114, "end": 3116, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3343, "end": 3345, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3366, "end": 3369, "text": "489", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3539, "end": 3541, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 3915, "end": 3917, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 4020, "end": 4022, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1124, "end": 1133, "text": "Figure S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF46"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1163, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF47"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1174, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1530, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "89"}, {"text": "The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may not be of any benefit because 537 it does not bind to the ACE2 receptor.

It should be emphasized that the lockdown in Wuhan was a complete lockdown, other 598 than bringing in necessary medical personnel, ventilators and PPE, as well as everyday goods 599 and supplies. The difference between this type of lockdown and the shelter in place 600 recommendations that have been put forward in many Western countries is that the lockdown in 601 Wuhan was strictly enforced. Laws in Wuhan limited grocery shopping to one person per 602 household, once every 2 days, with identity checks when leaving and returning. This type of 603 enforced lockdown was later extended to the rest of the country, so that even in cities of over 7 604 million and only 200 cases, the population experienced the same restrictions(Table 4). The entire 605 country stayed on lockdown for over two months. When lockdown measures were eased over the 606 past few weeks, temperature checks were still being performed and one had to show electronic 607 medical data on one's electronic device.
