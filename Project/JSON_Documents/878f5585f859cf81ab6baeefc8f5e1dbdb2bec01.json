            "text": "Since its recognition in February 2003, SARS has drawn enormous attention and triggered fears worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region. SARS is a new and probably previously unencountered severe and highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia, caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV. 1, 2 Since February 2003, SARS has spread to 28 countries and has affected 8202 individuals resulting in 725 deaths worldwide. 3 Most of these cases occurred in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore, which totalled 1726, 5316, 585 and 206 cases, respectively. 3 Other regions in the Asia Pacific are also affected, although the numbers remain low in Malaysia (five cases) and Thailand (eight cases). 3 Although Canada has had the only major outbreak outside Asia (148 cases), and currently has largely contained SARS, there are still sporadic cases at the time of writing. The economic impact to Hong Kong has been devastating although the morale of medical and other healthcare workers remains high. Despite the declining incidence of SARS worldwide, the possible emergence of future 'super-spreaders' should remind healthcare professionals and health authorities to stay vigilant, as only one or two of these index patients could trigger another major outbreak. [4] [5] [6] [7] Despite the original optimism of a low mortality for SARS, it is now believed that the mortality of SARS is in the region of 10-15%. 5, [7] [8] [9] While there is still gross deficiency in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnostic, management and prognostic aspects of SARS, altogether 647 articles have been published since February 2003, as listed in PubMed to date. The initial hopes of a speedy delivery of a rapid and reliable diagnostic test for SARS have failed to materialize. Consequently, SARS requires a clinical diagnosis, at least in the initial but often critical stages of the illness. [10] [11] [12] Treatment for SARS is also controversial and prognosis for these patients is still unclear. This article attempts to summarize some of the recent developments in this newly recognized condition.",

Although SARS-CoV is likely to be predominantly transmitted by droplets, it is also likely to infect others via contaminated items, particularly as SARS-CoV can live outside the body for several days. 4, 14 A recent outbreak in Amoy Gardens, a densely populated residential estate in Hong Kong, also demonstrated that infected stools could transmit SARS-CoV via defective sewage systems.",

The prohibitory high infection risk to bronchoscopists also barred more widespread efforts at performing transbronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages on SARS patients. Nevertheless, an electronically published article describing the autopsy results on six SARS patients described diffuse alveolar damage, macrophage infiltration and epithelial cell proliferation as the predominant features. 15 The earlier histological changes, performed on a ventilated patient by using video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy on day 5 of the illness, also revealed mild to moderate diffuse alveolar damage, manifesting as patchy hyaline membrane changes lining the alveolar ducts and some air spaces, and alveolar septal infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells. 4 There is therefore no diagnostic histological feature, other than identification of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, which would provide a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless, efforts should still be made, with strictest safety precautions in mind, to obtain histological or cytological samples from the lower respiratory tract of these patients, not only to exclude other mimicking conditions, but also to advance our understanding of this new disease.",

Collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate, however, has led to infection of nursing staff, and thus in some centres has been replaced by nasopharyngeal swabs. Sputum culture is often nondiagnostic, but should be performed to ensure adequate screening for infection by mycobacteria, fungi and Burkholderia pseudomallei , especially in the presence of rapidly deteriorating pneumonia in the Asia Pacific region. In suspected patients, especially in the presence of severe lymphopenia and rapidly deteriorating community acquired pneumonia (CAP), HIV infection has to be excluded. Serological testing for acute and convalescence antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , and Legionella pneumophilia is routinely performed in our centre.",

As administration of nebulized b 2 -agonist to a SARS patient was attributed to be the cause of a major hospital outbreak, such a mode for delivery of hypertonic saline to induce sputum production should be avoided. 7 Radiological assessment is probably one of the most important investigations for suspected and confirmed SARS patients. 4, 7 Daily CXR are performed for all suspected and probable SARS patients in most Crackles and bronchial breath sound Dyspnoea (60-80%) Diarrhoea (20-70%) Symptoms of respiratory failure (78%) 'Less usual' symptoms Rhinorrhoea or sneezing (probably < 5%) Sore throat (23-30%) Sputum production (10-29%) centres in Hong Kong. The most common early pattern is the presence of lower zone ground glass appearance and consolidation, which could rapidly progress to other lobes of the lung within 24 h (Fig. 1a,b) . Some patients also present initially with bilateral and fairly extensive consolidation, despite clinically being not markedly dyspnoeic. A very small proportion of patients display bilateral ground glass pattern on initial presentation, and more rarely, might even have nodular shadows over the 'background' ground glass patterns (Fig. 1c) . Up to 10% of our cases develop spontaneous pneumomediastinum, and this is often associated with the presence of fairly extensive disease and clinical deterioration (Fig. 2) . While there is no definite pattern, most SARS patients would show deterioration of CXR and unremitting fever despite antibiotic therapy.

[10] [11] [12] It is of note that only suspected and probable, but not confirmed, SARS are defined by the WHO and CDC. The latter stipulates the presence of severe clinical respiratory illness and epidemiological contact as 'probable' SARS, and moderate clinical respiratory illness and epidemiological contact as 'suspected' SARS. 11 The diagnosis of probable or suspected SARS therefore requires the presence of fever and respiratory symptoms, with or without radiographic evidence of consolidation. The other important prerequisite is the presence of contact or travel history, usually within the previous 10 days with a SARS patient or to an area with known local transmission within the visit period. 11 None of these guidelines actually requires the presence of a positive identification of SARS-CoV, and thus the diagnosis of SARS is ultimately based on clinical grounds. These guidelines are also rather loose in defining the conditions, and the clinical, investigative and radiological features described above should also be considered before making a diagnosis. Several groups have reported the successful application of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of SARS-CoV, 1, 6, 18, 20 although clinical application of this technique still remains to be validated. While serology of anti-SARS-CoV IgG appears to be specific and sensitive, this only provides a retrospective diagnosis. There is a delay in this seroconversion, possibly secondary to the administration of high dose corticosteroid therapy, High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of a 31-year-old woman with early SARS who presented 3 days after the onset of fever and chills showing bilateral lower lobe and peripheral ground glass appearances, especially in the posterior aspects of the lower lobes.

Potential SARS patients must be strictly isolated, and considerable infection control measures such as the use of appropriate protective devices (e.g. N95 masks, eye shields and gowns) and stringent infection control measures (e.g. negative pressure rooms) have to be deployed. In the absence of a reliable rapid diagnostic test, adoption of these measures could rapidly paralyze the daily running of many, if not most, busy general hospitals in this region. On the other hand, if strict infection control and stringent isolation measures are not taken, healthcare workers and fellow patients would be cross-infected. This would result in community out-breaks of SARS, as exemplified by the recent experience in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. [5] [6] [7] 9 MANAGEMENT The management consists of three parts. These include strict isolation policy and preventive measures to minimize cross infection. Patients with fever and CAP generally do not have SARS, and therefore should be treated with potent antibiotics and other measures to maximize their chances of rapid recovery. Specific anti-SARS therapy should only be commenced in cases that display typical and persistent haematological, biochemical, and radiological features of SARS, who do not respond to antibiotics, and with an epidemiological link.

The organization and logistics are as shown in Fig. 3 . Our policy is to rapidly isolate and closely observe these patients for radiographic changes as well as their clinical responses, while waiting for the RT-PCR results of nasopharyngeal swab and stool specimens. Most non-SARS patients tend to become apyrexial after antibiotic therapy (e.g. combination of a third generation cephalosporin and a macrolide). As different areas within the Asia Pacific region have very different aetiological microbes for CAP, it is imperative that local experience and data are used properly to provide adequate antimicrobial cover. SARS is a very emotionally taxing condition, both for the healthcare workers, the patient and the patient's family. Every effort must be made to communicate frequently and effectively with the patient and the patient's family, especially as we do not permit visitation throughout the entire hospitalization period. The wards have security officers outside to ensure strict adherence to isolation policy. We have a special phone set up for patients on each of the isolation wards, but the Hong Kong patients generally prefer to use their personal mobile phone to communicate with the outside world. All patients discharged from the isolation wards will still be managed with the same vigilance and are not permitted to have visitors. With regular and empathetic communication, and frequent contact with senior physicians, our patients appear to understand their responsibility to help contain SARS, and we seldom encounter cases who are not willing to cooperate.",

When these high-risk procedures have to be performed on SARS patients, very stringent personal protective equipment should be used. For intubation of patients, which carries an extremely high risk to the operator, we use even more stringent measures. Standard protection for this procedure should at least consist of two full body (neck to ankle length) gowns (outer waterproof and inner cotton surgical gown), two surgical gloves, N95 or N100 masks, full face shield, goggles, two surgical hats, and surgical theatre boots.

Naturally, the use of such therapy stirs anxiety in clinicians who face an overwhelming infection. Respiratory physicians in Hong Kong have amassed experience in the recent outbreak and generally concur that the use of high-dose corticosteroids is beneficial in SARS patients who show radiographic deterioration. Needless to say, repeated use of such therapy in the later stages of the disease could be associated with severe secondary sepsis, notably fungal pneumonias (N. S. Zhong, pers. comm., 2003). A number of regimens have been used in Hong Kong. These include: (i) hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg q.i.d. or 4 mg/kg t.i.d. i.v. followed by low-dose oral prednisolone; (ii) methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg q.i.d. or 4 mg/ kg t.i.d. i.v. followed by oral prednisolone, and (iii) pulse methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg b.i.d. reducing to 20-30 mg daily on day 21. 4,7,26 A very small proportion of patients, despite suffering from probable SARS and displaying virological evidence of acute SARS-CoV infection, appear to have an indolent course of illness.
