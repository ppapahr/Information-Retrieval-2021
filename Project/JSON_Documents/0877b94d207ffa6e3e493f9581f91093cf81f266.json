Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. However, the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30% to 60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f alternative diagnostic approach. A reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) method was established and evaluated. To explore the feasibility of RT-dPCR in diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2, a total of 196 clinical pharyngeal swab samples from 103 suspected patients, 77 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents were analyzed by RT-qPCR and then measured by the proposed RT-dPCR. For the 103 fever suspected patients, 19 (19/25) negative and 42 (42/49) equivocal tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For 29 close contacts (confirmed by additional sample and clinical follow up), 16 (16/17) equivocal and 1 negative tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR, which is implying that the RT-qPCR is missing a lot of asymptomatic patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 91%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. RT-dPCR is highly accurate method and suitable for detection of pharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 suspected patients and patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms. quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR); Sensitivity J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights Establishment of accurate and sensitive diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription digital PCR",

For the equivocal results it is necessary to conduct a retest and this would improve the positive rate of RT-qPCR. However, in the clinical practice under the current situation, it is impossible to do a same day retest due to the daily burden of thousands of incoming samples. The testing laboratory should initially report a result based on a single test, while secondary sampling for a later retest does not need to be sent to the same laboratory.

This would decrease the false negative rate by applying multiple methods. However, nucleic acid testing is still considered the gold standard as this is the most direct way to detect the presence of the virus. Thus, digital PCR method could be a powerful method because it can significantly improve the sensitivity for pharyngeal swab samples of the suspect patients. The overall sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-qPCR in our study were 36% and 52% (Table S8) Disease Information System (NIDIS).

The relevant information, RT-qPCR result and copy number determined by the proposed RT-dPCR assay is listed inTable S4. Among the 103 specimens, 81 (P1 to P81) were tested at KXR with the H&R RT-qPCR kit, 7 (P82-88) were tested at WHCDC by the Daan qPCR kit, and 15 samples (from P89-P103) were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tested at BJCDC with BioGerm RT-qPCR kit and the Chinese CDC assays.Firstly, the criteria claimed by the H&R kit manufacturer are: Ct value\u226435 are positive, Ct value >39.2 are negative, and 35<Ct<39.2 are equivocal. The criteria of the Daan qPCR kit are: Ct>40, negative, Ct \u226440, positive, and equivocal if only one gene with Ct\u226440 and no amplification for another gene. According to such criteria, 14 positive, 25 negative and 49 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported by qPCR (P1 to P88). For RT-dPCR, three targets are tested in parallel in the same laboratory and the determination of a positive result should meet the following criteria: quantification of any one of the three gene targets is \u22652 copies/ reaction. If no positive droplet was detected in FAM channel but positive droplets were detected in VIC indicating RNAseP positive for human reference control 15 , the sample can be judged negative. If 0<result<2, it should be attributed to equivocal and needs further verification. According to such criteria, 44 out of 49 equivocal and 17 out of 25 negatives were corrected to be positive by RT-dPCR and the positive rate significantly increased. No positive droplet was detected for the 6 negatives and copy numbers were quantified under the established LoD for 7 equivocal, due to either no virus sampled or ultra-low virus load in these specimens. For the 15 samples tested at Beijing CDC (P89 to P103), Ct values were not available and only negative or positive information were reported. Single gene target positive was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 positive based on parallel test with a commercial kit and the Chinese CDC assays. Therefore, these 15 samples were reported positive by BJCDC. 8 RT-qPCR negatives for ORF1ab were positive tested by RT-dPCR, showing high sensitivity for ORF1ab by RT-dPCR. Only 3 negatives for ORF1ab which can be complemented by E gene targets. Among the 103 specimens, 29 positive, 25 negative and 49 equivocal were reported by RT-qPCR. However, 61 samples including 19 negative and 42 equivocal tested by RT-qPCR were confirmed to be positive by RT-dPCR, thus 90 patients in total could be reported SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive and diagnosed with COVID-19. According to a follow-up survey, all the 103 patients were clinically J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection through later test of re-sampling by RT-qPCR and clinical symptoms. Thus, the true positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection was",

According to RT-qPCR result, 12 positive, one negative and 16 equivocal were reported. It is very difficult to detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids due the low virus load at the early stage for the close contacts. However, 15 out of 16 equivocal and one negative were positive by RT-dPCR. The equivocal rate was significantly decreased from 21% down to 1% according to the detection of RT-dPCR. Subsequently, the 16 RT-dPCR positive were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infected patients by both re-sampling test and a clinical follow up. This indicates that RT-qPCR can miss asymptomatic patients at first time. 16 samples (1 negative or 15 equivocal tested by RT-qPCR but positive by RT-dPCR) were reported with averaged viral load 66, 0.6 and 13 copies/reaction for ORF1ab, N and E, respectively, by RT-dPCR. Those 12 positive samples by RT-qPCR showed a relatively high viral load with an average of 666, 807 and 773 copies/reaction for ORF1ab, N and E, respectively. Furthermore, among the 16 specimens corrected by RT-dPCR, 6 persons (P14,18-21and P23 in supplemental information: Table S7) were directed for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f secondary testing following an initial negative test 2 to 10 days before. Based on RT-qPCR results, further isolation and observation was still needed to be conducted as the testing result is equivocal or negative and no clinical symptoms were observed for them. However, if based on RT-dPCR, all the six patients can be diagnosed with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 and treatment could be conducted earlier. This",
