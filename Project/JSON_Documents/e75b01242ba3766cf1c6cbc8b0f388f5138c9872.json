When looked at with the help of an electron microscope, there appears to be a unique corona around it. This family of viruses mainly cause respiratory diseases in humans, in the forms of common cold or pneumonia as well as respiratory infections. These viruses can infect animals as well (1, 2) . Up until the year 2003, coronavirus (CoV) had attracted limited interest from researchers. However, after the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV, the coronavirus was looked at with renewed interest (3, 4) . This also happened to be the first epidemic of the 21st century originating in the Guangdong province of China. Almost 10 years later, there was a MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2012, which was caused by the MERS-CoV (5, 6) . Both SARS and MERS have a zoonotic origin and originated from bats. A unique feature of these viruses is the ability to mutate rapidly and adapt to a new host. The zoonotic origin of these viruses allows them to jump from host to host. Coronaviruses are known to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor or the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) protein to gain entry into cells for replication (7) (8) (9) (10) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 389, "end": 391, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 634, "end": 636, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 881, "end": 883, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1297, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1301, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1305, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In December 2019, almost seven years after the MERS 2012 outbreak, a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) surfaced in Wuhan in the Hubei region of China.

The virus was suspected to have begun its spread in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the Wuhan region. It is possible that an animal that was carrying the virus was brought into or sold in the market, causing the spread of the virus in the crowded marketplace. One of the first claims made was in an article published in the Journal of Medical Virology (14) , which identified snakes as the possible host. A second possibility was that pangolins could be the wild host of SARS-CoV-2 (15) , though the most likely possibility is that the virus originated from bats (13, (16) (17) (18) (19) .

In the case of MERS, the dromedary camel is an intermediate host (5, 10) . Bats have been known to harbor coronaviruses for quite some time now. Just as in the case of avian flu, SARS, MERS, and possibly even HIV, with increasing selection and ecological pressure due to human activities, the virus made the jump from animal to man. Humans have been encroaching increasingly into forests, and this is true over much of China, as in Africa. Combined with additional ecological pressure due to climate change, such zoonotic spillovers are now more common than ever. It is likely that the next disease X will also have such an origin (25) . We have learned the importance of identification of the source organism due to the Ebola virus pandemic. Viruses are unstable organisms genetically, constantly mutating by genetic shift or drift. It is not possible to predict when a cross-species jump may occur and when a seemingly harmless variant form of the virus may turn into a deadly strain. Such an incident occurred in Reston, USA, with the Reston virus (26) , an alarming reminder of this possibility. The identification of the original host helps us to contain future spreads as well as to learn about the mechanism of transmission of viruses. Until the virus is isolated from a wild animal host, in this case, mostly bats, the zoonotic origin will remain hypothetical, though likely. It should further be noted that the virus has acquired several mutations, as noted by a group in China, indicating that there are more than two strains of the virus, which may have had an impact on its pathogenicity. However, this claim remains unproven, and many experts have argued otherwise; data proving this are not yet available (27) . A similar finding was reported from Italy and India independently, where they found two strains (28, 29) . These findings need to be further cross-verified by similar analyses globally. If true, this finding could effectively explain why some nations are more affected than others.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 700, "end": 704, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1792, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1895, "text": "(28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1899, "text": "29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ORIGIN"}, {"text": "When the spread of COVID-19 began (Figure 1) , the virus appeared to be contained within China and the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess, \" which formed the major clusters of the virus. However, as of April 2020, over 210 countries and territories are affected by the virus, with Europe, the USA, and Iran forming the new cluster of the virus. The USA (Figure 2 ) has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas India and China, despite being among the most populationdense countries in the world, have managed to constrain the infection rate by the implementation of a complete lockdown with arrangements in place to manage the confirmed cases. Similarly, the UK has also managed to maintain a low curve of the graph by implementing similar measures, though it was not strictly enforced. Reports have indicated that the presence of different strains or strands of the virus may have had an effect on the management of the infection rate of the virus (27) (28) (29) . The disease is spread by droplet transmission. As of April 2020, the total number of infected individuals stands at around 3 million, with \u223c200,000 deaths and more than 1 million recoveries globally (30, 34) . The virus thus has a fatality rate of around 2% and an R 0 of 3 based on current data. However, a more recent report from the CDC, Atlanta, USA, claims that the R 0 could be as high as 5.7 (35) . It has also been observed from data available from China and India that individuals likely to be infected by the virus from both these countries belong to the age groups of 20-50 years (36, 37) . In both of these countries, the working class mostly belongs to this age group, making exposure more likely. Germany and Singapore are great examples of countries with a high number of cases but low fatalities as compared to their immediate neighbors. Singapore is one of the few countries that had developed a detailed plan of action after the previous SARS outbreak to deal with a similar situation in the future, and this worked in their favor during this outbreak. Both countries took swift action after the outbreak began, with Singapore banning Chinese travelers and implementing screening and quarantine measures at a time when the WHO recommended none. They ordered the elderly and the vulnerable to strictly stay at home, and they ensured that lifesaving equipment and large-scale testing facilities were available immediately (38, 39) . Germany took similar measures by ramping up testing capacity quite early and by ensuring that all individuals had equal opportunity to get tested. This meant that young, old, and at-risk people all got tested, thus ensuring positive results early during disease progression and that most cases were mild like in Singapore, thus maintaining a lower death percentage (40) . It allowed infected individuals to be identified and quarantined before they even had symptoms. Testing was carried out at multiple labs, reducing the load and providing massive scale, something which countries such as the USA did quite late and India restricted to select government and private labs. The German government also banned large gatherings and advocated social distancing to further reduce the spread, though unlike India and the USA, this was done quite late. South Korea is another example of how a nation has managed to contain the spread and transmission of the infection. South Korea and the USA both reported their first COVID-19 cases on the same day; however, the US administration downplayed the risks of the disease, unlike South Korean officials, who constantly informed their citizens about the developments of the disease using the media and a centralized messaging system. They also employed the Trace, Test, and Treat protocol to identify and isolate patients fast, whereas the USA restricted this to patients with severe infection and only later broadened this criterion, like many European countries as well as India. Unlike the USA, South Korea also has universal healthcare, ensuring free diagnostic testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 969, "end": 973, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "(30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "text": "34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1571, "text": "(36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1575, "text": "37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2418, "text": "(38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2419, "end": 2422, "text": "39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2794, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 34, "end": 44, "text": "(Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 348, "end": 357, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "TRANSMISSION"}, {"text": "The main mode of transmission of 2019-nCoV is human to human.

Since current resources are directed towards understanding the hospitalized individuals showing symptoms, there is still a vast amount of information about asymptomatic individuals that has yet to be studied. For example, some questions that need to be answered include: Do asymptomatic individuals develop the disease at any point in time at all? Do they eventually develop antibodies?

The uncoated RNA is then translated, and viral proteins are synthesized. With the help of RNAdependant RNA polymerase, new RNA is produced for the new virions.

The virus has an incubation time of 2-14 days, which is the reason why most patients suspected to have the illness or contact with an individual having the illness remain in quarantine for the said amount of time. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe pneumonia, intermittent fever, and cough (50, 51) . Symptoms of rhinorrhoea, pharyngitis, and sneezing have been less commonly seen. Patients often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome within 2 days of hospital admission, requiring ventilatory support. It has been observed that during this phase, the mortality tends to be high. Chest CT will show indicators of pneumonia and ground-glass opacity, a feature that has helped to improve the preliminary diagnosis (51) . The primary method of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 is with the help of PCR. For the PCR testing, the US CDC recommends testing for the N gene, whereas the Chinese CDC recommends the use of ORF lab and N gene of the viral genome for testing. Some also rely on the radiological findings for preliminary screening (52) . Additionally, immunodiagnostic tests based on the presence of antibodies can also play a role in testing. While the WHO recommends the use of these tests for research use, many countries have pre-emptively deployed the use of these tests in the hope of ramping up the rate and speed of testing (52) (53) (54) . Later, they noticed variations among the results, causing them to stop the use of such kits; there was also debate among the experts about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. For immunological tests, it is beneficial to test for antibodies against the virus produced by the body rather than to test for the presence of the viral proteins, since the antibodies can be present in larger titers for a longer span of time. However, the cross-reactivity of these tests with other coronavirus antibodies is something that needs verification. Biochemical parameters such as D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and variations in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are some other parameters that can be used to make a preliminary diagnosis; however, these parameters vary in a number of diseases and thus cannot be relied upon conclusively (51) . Patients with pre-existing diseases such as asthma or similar lung disorder are at higher risk, requiring life support, as are those with other diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or obesity. Those above the age of 60 have displayed the highest mortality rate in China, a finding that is mirrored in other nations as well (Figure 3 ) (55). If we cross-verify these findings with the population share that is above the age of 70, we find that Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the USA have one of the highest elderly populations as compared to countries such as India and China (Figure 4) , and this also reflects the case fatality rates accordingly ( Figure 5 ) (33) . This is a clear indicator that aside from comorbidities, age is also an independent risk factor for death in those infected by COVID-19. Also, in the US, it was seen that the rates of African American deaths were higher. This is probably due to the fact that the prevalence of hypertension and obesity in this community is higher than in Caucasians (56, 57) . In late April 2020, there are also claims in the US media that young patients in the US with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of stroke; however, this is yet to be proven. We know that coagulopathy is a feature of COVID-19, and thus stroke is likely in this condition (58, 59) . The main cause of death in COVID-19 patients was acute respiratory distress due to the inflammation in the linings of the lungs caused by the cytokine storm, which is seen in all non-survival cases and in respiratory failure. The resultant inflammation in the lungs, served as an entry point of further infection, associated with coagulopathy end-organ failure, septic shock, and secondary infections leading to death (60-63).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 379, "text": "(50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 380, "end": 383, "text": "51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 803, "end": 807, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1422, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1427, "text": "(53)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1432, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2271, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2950, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3302, "end": 3306, "text": "(56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3310, "text": "57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 3582, "end": 3586, "text": "(58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3587, "end": 3590, "text": "59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2601, "end": 2610, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2871, "text": "(Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2935, "end": 2943, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "CLINICAL PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "For COVID-19, there is no specific treatment available.

This agent was originally developed for Ebola Virus Disease (77) . A study was conducted with rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 (78) . In that study, after 12 h of infection, the monkeys were treated with either Remdesivir or vehicle. The drug showed good distribution in the lungs, and the animals treated with the drug showed a better clinical score than the vehicle group. The radiological findings of the study also indicated that the animals treated with Remdesivir have less lung damage. There was a reduction in viral replication but not in virus shedding. Furthermore, there were no mutations found in the RNA polymerase sequences. A randomized clinical control study that became available in late April 2020 (79) , having 158 on the Remdesivir arm and 79 on the placebo arm, found that Remdesivir reduced the time to recovery in the Remdesivir-treated arm to 11 days, while the placebo-arm recovery time was 15 days. Though this was not found to be statistically significant, the agent provided a basis for further studies. The 28-days mortality was found to be similar for both groups. This has now provided us with a basis on which to develop future molecules. The study has been supported by the National Institute of Health, USA. The authors of the study advocated for more clinical trials with Remdesivir with a larger population. Such larger studies are already in progress, and their results are awaited. Remdesivir is currently one of the drugs that hold most promise against COVID-19. An early trial in China with Lopinavir and Ritonavir showed no benefit compared with standard clinical care (80) .

Global experts have a pessimistic outlook on the outcome of this outbreak (98) . The fear of COVID-19 disease, lack of proper understanding of the dangers of the virus, and the misinformation spread on the social media (99) have caused a breakdown of the economic flow globally (100) . An example of this is Indonesia, where a great amount of fear was expressed in responses to a survey when the nation was still free of COVID-19 (101) . The pandemic has resulted in over 2.6 billion people being put under lockdown. This lockdown and the cancellation of the lunar year celebration has affected business at the local level. Hundreds of flights have been canceled, and tourism globally has been affected. Japan and Indonesia are estimated to lose over 2.44 billion dollars due to this (102, 103) . Workers are not able to work in factories, transportation in all forms is restricted, and goods are not produced or moved. The transport of finished products and raw materials out of China is low. The Economist has published US stock market details indicating that companies in the US that have Chinese roots fell, on average, 5 points on the stock market as compared to the S&P 500 index (104) . Companies such as Starbucks have had to close over 4,000 outlets due to the outbreak as a precaution.

In contrast, the ratings of US President Donald Trump have dropped due to the manner in which the COVID-19 pandemic was handled. These minor impacts may be of temporary significance, and the worst and direct impact will be on China itself (107) (108) (109) , as the looming trade war with the USA had a negative impact on the Chinese and Asian markets.
