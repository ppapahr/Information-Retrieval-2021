We show that the shorter cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre-and post lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.",

            "text": "what the impact of measures that came in on March 23 will be\". The measures that Professor McLean referred to were the widespread UK social distancing and lockdown interventions made in the face of the COVID-19 threat. At the time of writing, few countries have experienced in excess of 70 days of COVID-19 cases and most only have around 50 days. Professor McLean is correct in that many scientific inferences require longer time series than those currently available. However, we show that there are considerable and useful similarities in the underlying cyclic (spectral) behaviours of the numbers of new daily COVID-19 cases for a range of different countries (see Extended Data figures). We use recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods [3] (regspec) to pool spectral information across countries, which provides significantly more accurate estimates of cyclic behaviour than provided by a typical spectral analysis of a single country alone. The Bayesian principles underlying our fusion method handle mean that uncertainty is treated coherently, producing rational uncertainy assessment for our cycle (spectral) estimates. Our methods produce cycle estimates using the equivalent of over nine hundred daily observations, compared to the fifty or so that a typical standard spectral analysis might use. Using data [2] from all of the countries we considered, our results show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases have three underlying cycles: one operating at a wavelength of 2.7 days, a second at 4.1 days and a third at 6.7 days, which we take to be a weekly effect. We conducted separate analyses for the UK and groups of countries with similar spectra and note some variation in those cycles.",

For example, different countries might use different definitions of the number of daily cases and they record cases through different national structures and this is even the case for countries with political, geographical or cultural similarities. However, as long as the method of recording cases is broadly unchanged over the period in question for a particular country, the spectral properties across countries are comparable. The transformed cases' spectrum quantifies the internal oscillatory structure within the series and is largely unaffected by the overall level of cases, the different start times of epidemics in different countries (phase) and country-specific internal delays due to reporting requirements (also phase). In addition, the demonstration of the presence three consistent cycles across all countries, with some variation, provides supporting evidence for the suitability of the transformed new daily cases as a target of analysis, and comparisons between and across countries,",

We consider this question for the group consisting of the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. The number of days (with cases) be-fore lockdown is, on average, 22 for this group of countries, and, after lockdown, is 26 (except the UK, which started its lockdown later). The averages just quoted include allowance for a seven day incubation period. Our analysis compares the spectral properties before and after lockdown. A spectrum based on about 25 days worth of data would provide a very poor and highly uncertain estimate. However, our spectral fusion methods [3] permit effective sample sizes for the group of 192 days worth of data prior to the lockdown, and 196 after, resulting in highly accurate spectral estimates for these periods. We learn that, after lockdown, the weekly cycle remains strong, but the cycles operating around 2.7 and 4.1 days become suppressed. This indicates that the weekly cycle is due, at least in part, to administrative recording effects, which are not effected by the lockdown, whereas the 2.7 and 4.1 day cycles might be related to virus dynamics, which is certainly affected by lockdown.",

Such information would be of great interest, e.g., to those planning health provision over a short timescale. Knowledge of the three cycles is helpful and we have had moderate success in forecasting daily cases. However, with individual country series, with smaller number of days, it is unrealistic to expect too much and, in particular, the transformed cycles experience both a degree of time-modulation and possible frequency changes. More useful perhaps, are not daily forecasts, but the knowledge that the number of cases will increase and decrease over a period of three/four days. This means that if one observes a decrease in the number of daily COVID-19 cases after lockdown, that does not necessarily mean the peak has been reached, but is simply a manifestation of the 3/4 day cycles. Hence, one might believe a lockdown strategy has been successful after a sustained decrease of at least four days.",

            "text": "Spectral analysis [1, 5] of epidemics is not new, but most work has been carried out on epidemics observed over long time periods (seasons and years) using lengthy time series [6, 7, 8] . Recent work [9] on COVID-19 has applied popular autoregressive integrated moving average process [10, 1] models to a single prevalence time series with a sample size of n = 22. However, conclusions derived from such analyses on a single series with such small sample sizes [11] are questionable. For example, an autoregressive process of order one with parameter 0.9, normally considered to be a strong signal, is only distinguishable from white noise [12] approximately 20% of the time with sample size of n = 22; basic simulation studies show the large number of possible different models that can fit such short series apparently well. This indicates that it is virtually impossible to tie down the correct model with such a small sample size. Phenomenological sub-epidemic models [13, 14] show much more promise and have been applied with some success to short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. These improve performance by using bootstrap methods on short case time series, but are still ultimately based on a parametric model of single series. Our work is very different as it provides exceptionally accurate spectral estimates for a novel live epidemic that is still in its early days on short series, but reliably so by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion techniques. [3] . The nonparametric nature of our analysis also permits us to split case time series at a boundary (e.g. lockdown or other intervention) and analyse the two halves separately, still with very short series in each. This is perhaps harder to do with classical parametric models and to maintain consistency between the two halves. On the other hand, our method relies on good quality case series from different regions, which is again not always the case for all epidemics.",

            "text": "We transformed the number of new daily COVID-19 cases by applying a signed log transform to the first differences of the new case time series (see Methods). The transformed number of new daily cases for 16 countries are shown in Figure 1 each showing a distorted noisy, but characteristic sinusoidal trace. The estimated log-spectrum for the UK transformed new daily cases is shown in Figure 2 and for all other countries we analysed in the Extended Data figures. Spectral estimates are commonly displayed on a logarithmic scale [16] . Spectral peaks can be observed at wavelengths of 6.7, 3.2 and 2.3 days, respectively. Although the peaks are visible, the credible intervals indicate that there is a fairly large degree of uncertainty, because this time series contains 52 observations. A frequentist analysis, e.g. using the spectrum function in R [16] , produces a similar result, but with even wider confidence bands. Similar spectral analyses for each country indicate three similar spectral peaks, although not always as well-defined nor in precisely the same location. Figure 3 shows an estimate that is the result of coherently fusing spectra from 18 countries, giving an an effective sample size of 916 days. Here, the clear spectral peaks have narrow credible intervals, due to the large effective number of days afforded by using 18 countries together. The spectral peaks are located at wavelengths of 6.7, 4.1 and 2.7 days. The peak around 6.7 days is observed in the spectral plots for individual countries and we interpret it to be a weekly effect. Such a weekly effect could be produced by reporting artefacts (e.g. paperwork being delayed until Monday, or carried out differently at the weekend) or due to the behaviour differences of people at weekends. All countries analysed have a 5+2 working week/weekend pattern, although not necessarily the same days of the week (the actual days for a weekend are a phase effect, which does not effect the spectrum). Clustering spectra and groups of countries with similar spectra We next clustered our 18 countries based on their spectrum, by calculating a dissimilarity between the spectra for each pair of countries, and then performing both a hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling on the dissimilarity matrix. The scaling solution indicated that only two dimensions were required to encapsulate 72% of variation in the data. Figure 4 shows the resultant twodimensional solution. Attaching a meaning to the scaling axes in Figure 4 is not easy. We hypothesise that Axis 1 might indicate how badly a country has been perceived to have been affected by the virus with Australia, New Zealand and Sweden less so and those on the left of the plot considerably more so. However, Germany is the obvious anomaly to this interpretation as, currently, it has perhaps been perceived to have handled the crisis well so far. Table 1 : Spectral peaks for the three country groups in units of days. The peaks in the second and third rows have been arbitrarily labelled as peak a. and b. Figure 5 show the spectral estimates for the three groups of countries identified in Figure 4 , using the clustering techniques mentioned in Methods. The peak frequencies for each of these groups is listed in Table 1 , which shows differences between them. However, each group possesses a possible weekly peak and higherfrequency peaks labelled a., of around three to four days, and b., around 2.6 days.",

For model evaluation we put more weight on getting later observations correct and use a residual weight vector w t = (t/n) 2 where t = 1, . . . , n and n is the number of cases. For short term forecasting, we fit m(t) to the transformed daily cases by weighted least-squares using standard R [16] optimisation functions and then extrapolate m(t), using recent weighted residuals to estimate the forecasting error.",
