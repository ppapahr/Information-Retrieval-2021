Abnormal coagulation parameters are a key feature of COVID-19 especially in critically ill patients. One study showed that 78% of non-survivors fulfilled the laboratory criteria of DIC [3] .

Two patients were overweight with a BMI of 28 and 30, respectively. All patients initially complained of cough and fever and some felt weak or had throat pain as well. Three patients were initially managed as outpatients in home isolation and did not receive any anticoagulation or further medication. Initial symptoms completely resolved in these patients but they developed new onset of dyspnea and/or thoracic pain at days 14 to 26 and had to be admitted to the Kaiser-Franz-Josef hospital. One patient (patient 3) had to be admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 and received prophylactic anticoagulation (Nadroparin 0.6 ml s.c. once daily) for 7 days during his admission. He was discharged with complete resolution of symptoms but developed new onset of dyspnea the following day which lead to re-admission. Inflammation markers were only slightly elevated in 3 of 4 patients on the day of PE diagnosis. No abnormalities in common coagulation tests were observed. Two of the 4 patients were already SARS-CoV-2 negative in nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of PE diagnosis. In 3 of the 4 patients, ECG showed sinus tachycardia (112-125 bpm), one patient had a right axis deviation. CT scans revealed large bilateral PE in two patients and smaller unilateral PE in the other two patients. D-Dimer levels varied between 1.06 and 16.96 mg/L and where higher in patients with bilateral PE. None of the patients had signs nor history of deep vein thrombosis. After diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established, patients were started on anticoagulation therapy with LWMH and direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) and recovered.

            "text": "Immobilization, dehydration, inflammation-induced hypercoagulability, and genetic thrombophilia are established risk factors for thrombosis associated with many bacterial and viral infections. Our patients did not have any history of prior deep vein thrombosis, PE, or any other clotting disease. Common clotting tests did not show any abnormalities beside elevated D-Dimer levels. A Chinese study found elevated D-Dimer and decreased antithrombin levels even in non-severely ill patients [5] . The prevalence of DVT in a small study of 81 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a median age of 60 years and 54% females who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation was 25% [6] . This unusual high rate of coagulopathies associated with COVID-19 suggest additional causes and warrants further investigation. BMI body mass index, PE pulmonary embolism, PT prothrombin time, aPPT activated partial thromboplastin time, ECG electro cardiogram, bpm beats per minute, LWMH low weight molecular heparin, ()normal ranges SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells via the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which may lead to a depletion of ACE2 with the consequence of increased Angiotensin II (AT II) levels [7] . Studies showed that AT II stimulates tissue-factor (TF) expression in vascular endothelial cells [8] and release of plasminogen activator inihibor-1 (PAI-1) from adipocytes which leads to increased coagulation and impaired fibrinolysis [9] . Recently, a small Chinese study showed an association between AT II levels, viral load, and severity of lung injury [10] . This effect may be even more pronounced in overweight patients. PE was more severe in our overweight patients. Furthermore, hypoxia is a common feature of COVID-19 and might contribute to increased risk of thrombosis via hypoxemia-induced vasoconstriction which is a physiological reaction in the lung [11] . None of our patient received oxygen supplementation before the onset of PE, and oxygen requirement was not monitored during their home isolation. Therefore, we cannot rule out hypoxic states during this time. All patients showed a disease trajectory characterised by two peaks. This should raise suspicion of PE even in patients who received prophylactic anticoagulation as shown by patient 3. He received 7 days of LWMH and did not show any clinical signs of DVT nor PE during hospitalisation but developed PE one day after discharge. A subclinical PE may have been unrecognised in patient 3 during his hospital stay but is unlikely because he did not require any oxygen and felt completely well at the time of discharge.",
