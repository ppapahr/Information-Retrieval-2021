Their responses were investigated by monitoring the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band shift. As the external pH was gradually changed from neutral pH to pH ~2 the peak of the SPR band showed a significant red-shift, with a sigmoidal feature implying the formation of the gold-protein aggregates. The coating of S protein changed the surface property of the gold enough to extract the coverage fraction of protein over nano particles, \u0398, which did not exhibit clear nano-size dependence. The geometrical simulation to explain \u0398 showed the average axial length to be a = 7. 25 nm and b = 8.00 nm when the S-protein was hypothesized as a prolate shape with spiking-out orientation. As the pH value externally hopped between pH~3 and pH~10, a behavior of reversible protein folding was observed for particles with diameters >30 nm. It was concluded that S protein adsorption conformation was impacted by the size (diameter, d) of a core nano-gold, where head-to-head dimerized S protein J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 was estimated for d \uf0a3 80 nm and a parallel in opposite directions formation for d = 100 nm.",

            "text": "A critical initial stage of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Reparatory Syndrome Corona Virus 2) is attributed to receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 to the human ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Extensive studies identified that S protein consists of an S1 region (mainly RBD) and S2 region (a mechanical thruster for the cell fusion process). [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] A priming of the S protein by a protease [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] promotes a drastic conformational change in S2 segment of the S protein into a hair-pin intermediate accessing the target cell surface at the pre-fusion process, 23, 34-36 a sequential protein folding enables the virus to conduct cell fusion and launch the RNA embedded in SARS-CoV-2 [37] [38] [39] into the cell and initiating the virus replications. Tremendous effort and clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the inhibition or inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. [40] [41] [42] As one of major approaches in the vaccine development, preventing the cell-fusion process by deactivating s protein could be considered as one of effective approaches. Because of nano-size dimension of SARS-CoV-2, several efforts of decorating S protein over the nano-particle (i.e., nano-particles functionalized with S protein) have been providing information on an interaction of S protein by taking advantage of spectroscopic signals originating from nano-particles. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] For example, Gorshkov and et. al. , probed a binding of S protein to ACE2 by utilizing fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) functionalized with S proteins. 44 A model system of the S protein can be potentially used as an in vitro tool for drug screening. 23 Our prior studies revealed that a relatively wider range of pH value can prepare critical conformation for a protein networking as it is adsorbed over the gold surface. Especially, the acidic condition creates the unfolded conformation leading to the aggregation of the gold colloids through an interaction between the adsorbed proteins. The basic condition, on the other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hand, forms folded protein conformation avoiding the protein-protein networking and preventing the aggregates. As an advantage of utilizing the gold colloid, the formation or deformation of gold colloid aggregates are sensitively reflected by the peak position of the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) band. Above pH 7, the absorption peak around 525 nm corresponding to the dispersed gold colloids is exhibited. On the other hand, below pH 4, the formation of the gold colloid aggregates shows a red-shift (i.e., peak around 630 nm). The SPR band peak shift as a function of the pH was best explained by a sigmoidal feature, and our group established a method to use the parameters from the fit to transform the coverage ratio of the protein over the gold colloidal surface. 53 In order to reproduce the coverage ratio, it required to involve a geometrical information of the protein adsorption. As of now, our spectroscopic study utilizing the pH induced conformational change is the only successful approach explains the most plausible adsorption orientation. 54 As another reasons to require us to cover the wider pH range, it should be noted that the highly acidic condition (i.e., around pH 4) is speculated to prepares the up conformation in one of three protomers of the RBD side of an S protein before initiating the binding to the ACE2 and also is considered to model the pH condition after endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 to achieve a cell fusion process. 8, 22, 35, 55, 56 ",

            "text": "The extracted \uf051 values were reproduced by conducting the geometric simulation reported previously. 53, 54 The simplification of the S protein structure was treated by assuming it to the prolate top as shown in Fig. 3 . While S protein possesses the shape of blot head with stem (mushroom like shape ( Fig. 3 (i) ), the justification of prolate shape approximation is because \uf051 can be determined by the projected area onto the sphere. The area dominates to occupying the sphere can be replaced by transposing the same dimension onto the equatorial region of the prolate ( Fig. 3 (ii) and 3(iii)). Based on the reported geometrical structure from crystal structure reported by Wrapp and et. al. the initial values for the simulation were set as a = 5.3 nm and b = 8.9 nm with a \"spiking-out\" orientation of the protein from the particle surface. 59 The axial lengths were optimized to match with extracted \uf051 for each gold colloid of diameter d (conventional size) and reported diameter size d was used for the fit as shown in Fig. 4 . It failed to reproduce the drastically low \uf051 observed for d = 40 nm and d = 60 nm, and an empirical factor (\uf067) was employed in order to indicate that the adsorbed S proteins did not impact \uf044pH o (\uf067 ~ 5 %). In Fig. 4 , the average \uf051 of S protein, \u0398 \u0305 (S protein), showed the lowest compared to the \u0398 \u0305 's of three amyloidogenic peptides (amyloid beta 1-40 (A\uf062 1-40 ), alpha synuclein (\uf061-syn), and beta 2 microglobulin (\uf0622m)), where \u0398 \u0305 (\uf0622m) > \u0398 \u0305 (A\uf062 1-40 ) > \u0398 \u0305 (\uf061-syn) > \u0398 \u0305 (S-protein). Another unique point in S protein was that a low contribution of the secondary layer was observed (i.e., ~100% first layer), except for the gold colloid with 100 nm diameter, where 40% of the coverage J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was contributed from the second layer ( Table 1) . The average contribution of the second layer in amyloidogenic peptides coated gold colloids was ~40%. 60 Under the pH hopping scheme, the undulation of \uf06c \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 was observed for the S protein gold colloid with d > 30 nm. The representative examples for S protein coated 40 nm and 80 nm gold colloids are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b . Here, the pH value at the n (operation number) = 1 is an initial pH and it was around pH 7. Then, the pH at an even operation number indicates around pH ~ 3 and pH ~ 10 for any odd operation numbers \uf0b3 2. The analytical formula was applied to explain this behavior and was concluded that there was a reversible aggregation/disaggregation of gold nano-colloid mediated by S protein at the interface. 57 A reversible process was interpreted to be the stage of gold nano particle dispersed and aggregated. The aggregation of the gold colloid was presumed to be due to the mediation of the S protein over the gold colloid surface. The obvious reversible process was observed for the gold colloid over diameter of 30 nm. 57 In reversible undulation feature, there was two patterns which contained a discontinuity in amplitude as well as damping factor as represented in d = 40 nm gold colloid (see Fig. 5a ). On the other hand, we observed one single amplitude and damping factor for the reversible undulation in d = 80 nm and 100 nm (See Fig. 5b) . The discontinuity of the undulation amplitude (and damping factor) was observed for d = 40 nm, 50 nm, and 60 nm. The undulation feature was explained by Eqn. (1) 57",

The recent computational simulation led by Rommie Amaro's group pointed out the importance of glycan shielding over the S protein playing the key role to form the up conformation, 34 suggesting that it requires further investigation if external pH change to the acidic is a real trigger to form up conformation.",

As for d = 40 and 50 nm, the damping feature was the same before and after the discontinuity with a drastic decrease in amplitude. On the other hand, for d = 60 nm, the damping feature reversed to become amplifying after the discontinuity with approximately the same amplitude. Therefore, there may be two different path of aggregation formation depending on the core nano-particle size. However, no further detailed information was extracted from the current observations. The possible rational would be that the kinetic factor may be involved. In pH hopping process, we maintained the interval time between each operation number to be roughly the same, i.e., 5 minutes. It is conceivable that after initial acidic condition was achieved at the operation number n = 2, it may take 39 \uf0b1 3 minutes to reach to the other reversible channel. The current study was designed to be insensitive to the kinetic factor and the interval times of each spectrum collection was not J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f precisely consistent.

By simplifying the S protein as a prolate shape, the adsorption orientation was concluded to be \"spiking-out\" orientation. These data suggest that the gold colloids could successfully reproduce the orientation of the S protein as that seen in SARS -CoV-2. However, the current study did not extract the direction of the RBD of the S protein. Although beyond the scope of the present work, one way to confirm if the RBD side is facing toward the outside can be to interact the S protein coated gold colloid with ACE2. The binding of the ACE2 to RBD is expected to cause a cleavage of the RBD followed by the formation of pre-hairpin by an extension of protomers of fusion proteins. 7, 9, 11, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] On the other hand, no further conformational change of S protein in response to ACE2 would be observed, if the RBD side is used for anchoring on the gold surface. Two limitations of the current spectroscopic approach is that it is unable to determine if the RBD side is facing inward or outward and would not be able to probe the conformational change of the S protein induced by the ACE2 binding. However, based on this study into S protein adsorption onto gold we can now use the gold protein system to probe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 and the corresponding conformational change of an S protein using more complex spectroscopic techniques.",

In both schemes each spectrum was processed with component of the band expressed by a Gaussian profile by Peak Fit function of OriginPro 2018b (Origin Lab), and the spectrum area weight average peak position of the spectrum in the region between 400 nm and 850 nm was extracted.57",

For example, having characterized the S protein system's behavior during pH changes, compounds could now be screened based on their ability to alter the S protein's pH response using this SPR technique described above. As the future project, investigation of the cell fusion kinetics of the S protein as it is interacted with ACE2 is expected to provide a prototypeapproach of mimicking viral cell fusion process. There are a number of pathogenic viruses, which possesses same type of viral structure as SARS-CoV-2, such as Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), Influenza virus, Zaire Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These viruses are protected by a viral membrane requiring the viral capsid to fuse with a cell as an initial step in the infection process. 25, 67 Thus, by utilizing corresponding glycoprotein coated nano gold colloid, the general rule of fusion process involving glycoproteins can be investigated.",
