This guidance, among others, is much needed to reduce infection and potential spread of COVID-19. Within this guidance, several factors are identified as increasing a person's vulnerability of severe illness, and as a result, efforts to maintain social distancing is to be more stringent for these groups.",

Although it is recognised that a higher BMI has been associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, all of which are predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19, 3 to date, no available data show adverse COVID-19 outcomes specifically in people with a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher. This absence of data might explain why, unlike with other factors identified as reasons for a higher-risk status, there is a paucity of information to explain the reason why people with a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher, as an independent risk factor, are included as a high-risk group. In comparison, information about the reasons that a person with diabetes is at an increased risk of severe illness have been shared widely between people living with diabetes, healthcare workers, and community support networks.",

Similarly, and of concern, is that the BMI cutoff (\u226540kg/m2) might give false safety for people with obesity at lower BMIs. Thus, there is a need for more evidence and information to raise awareness of why a BMI of 40kg/m2 or higher has been identified as a cutoff for increased risk of severe illness as a result of COVID-19, and also for health-care practitioners, organisations, and charities to inform and care for individuals seeking support.",
