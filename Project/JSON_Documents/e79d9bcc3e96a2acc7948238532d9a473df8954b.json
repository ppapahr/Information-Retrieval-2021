            "text": "Background: Complexity and functions of automated medical devices used to support life (eg, ventilators, dialysis machines, monitors, insulin pump with continuous blood glucose monitoring system, etc.) increase over time. Until recently, devices were partially automated by very simple feedback loops, with no or few software dependence (such as the simplest home thermostat). For the last two decades, devices have been increasingly driven by complex algorithms devoted to improve patient's treatment and monitoring as well as users experience. Methods: We report the unexpected and inappropriate operation of two recent ventilators, associated to potential harmful consequences. We provide both a description of the clinical situations (five ICU patients, archetypal situations) and a test bench analysis. Results: While set in volume mode, these ventilators activated an algorithm dedicated to limit airway pressure when an increase in airway resistance occurred. In such situations, a pressure-like mode was activated (with decelerating inspiratory flow and set pressure, with target of volume). The main consequences observed were that the tidal volume was no longer guaranteed or delivered and that the pressure limitation operated by the algorithm prevented the airway pressure from reaching the high-pressure alarm threshold. Conclusion: This led to the silent takeover of commands by the ventilator without clinicians or nurses being aware of it and without any warnings or alarms emission adapted to the severity of the event. Generally speaking, such an algorithm questions the place of automation and its limit when users are not aware of its presence as well as the need for regulation and additional tests before its implementation. Intensivists and respiratory care specialists should remain vigilant regarding the risk of rare but critical events related to unexpected functioning or insufficiently tested equipment during the pre-clinical development phases. They should not neglect misunderstood critical events without having performed sufficient investigations.",

Surprisingly, the intensivist noticed unexpected changes in the pressure and flow curves pattern displayed on the ventilator screen: the typical peak-plateau shape and the square inspiratory flow usually observed in volumecontrolled mode were replaced by pressure-support like curves with a constant pressure and a decelerating flow, respectively. Delivered Vt was consistent with Vte and both were constantly below 200 mL. The maximal V visualized on the flow curve was below 30 L/min. Setting FiO 2 to 100% did not improve SpO 2 . Simultaneously, a systematic endotracheal tube aspiration was performed and allowed the nurse to detect a tube bending in its external portion. Immediate correction of this anomaly instantaneously modified the pressure-flow curves, with a return to the expected curve shape usually observed in volume-controlled mode and to the expected respiratory parameters including Vt, V , and SpO 2 . Lowest SpO 2 was 50% and no adverse cardiac event occurred. The patient's head position was subsequently modified to avoid further tube bending. It turned out that small alternating movements produced by the automatic anti-bedsore mattress were responsible for head and endotracheal tube conformation changes and explained the bending of the endotracheal tube, already positioned in a non-optimal way in prone position.",

The increase in FiO 2 did not alleviate the patient's dyspnea but improved the SpO 2 value. The patient rapidly fell into a coma due to hypercapnia with decreasing respiratory drive, but he was still triggering each cycle. The increase of the upper limit of the airway pressure alarm to its maximal value did not change anything with the ventilator operation as pressure was limited during inspiration (a permanent flat line was displayed during inspiration). Inspiratory flow was decelerating and its value was below those prescribed. Once SpO 2 corrected, the ventilator was unplugged, the inner cannula of the tracheotomy replaced by a new one (and its obstruction by dried and clogged secretions confirmed). The patient was then reconnected to the same ventilator without any change in its settings. As soon as it was reconnected, the ventilator displayed the expected curves with peak and plateau pressures associated with a constant inspiratory flow, the values of which were those prescribed. Regarding the ventilator, its unexpected behavior was interpreted as a malfunction and it was sent for service. No dysfunction was found and this third incident was interpreted, with some black humor, as a curse.",

The major problems observed then were: a) due to the pressure limitation settled autonomously by the ventilator, the prescribed Vt was not delivered to the patient, but only a Vt <100 mL; b) nothing could be done by the intensivist to force the ventilator to correctly administer the set Vt and to continue a high-pressure ventilation. A low-severity alarm of partially delivered tidal volume appeared, followed by a high-severity alarm of low minute volume. The phenomenon was reproduced three times and the fiberoptic examination had to be discontinued to limit hypercapnia. The bronchoscopy was then continued using a transport ventilator (Oxylog 3000, Dr\u00e4ger) without incident. At this stage, discussion with colleagues of such unwanted behavior from a ventilator led to an acute understanding of what was formerly observed and described in the previous mentioned cases.

An Evita \u00ae Infinity \u00ae V500 ventilator was used in volume-controlled mode with standard settings (Vt 500 mL, RR 20/ min, V 60 L/min, Ti 0.8 sec, P high 50 mbar, PEEP 5 mbar with P max , ATC \u00ae , and AutoFlow \u00ae functions set to off).

High airway pressure alarm (red line) was set to 60 mbar (A) or 45 mbar (B). A complete (A) or incomplete (B) obstruction were simulated by a direct maneuver exerted on the tube, triggering the activation of the algorithm. This activation was associated with changes in pressure and flow curves shape, adopting from that moment the shape usually observed in pressure support mode (target of pressure and decelerating flow).

We also concede that such an answer cannot be binary as the complexity of each domain of application is highly pleiotropic, preventing any easy and straightforward conclusions. Clearly, automation (regarding basic actions but also analysis of complex signals) improve reliability and reactivity when applied to reproductive and invariable schemes. But when unexpected and imponderable situations emerge with signals not originally included in the analysis loops, an automated answer cannot be the best answer and the human intellect proves to be the best tool in these situations. 8, 9 The increasing involvement of algorithms and automation in medical devices, in addition to improving precision and complexity (ie, overall system performance), is not necessarily associated with greater reliability. As discussed by Bequette 10 in a commentary focusing on automated insulin delivery devices (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems), the presence \"in the loop\" of a human eye (or action) is critical when facing unusual situations or unexpected behavior of a system.",

The extremity of this tube was inserted air-tightly within a test balloon (2,3 L, silicone, ref. 2166062, Dr\u00e4ger). Absence of leak was checked (Vt=Vte). With this setting, peak pressure was 34 mbar, plateau pressure 25 mbar, and R 9 mbar/L/s. After the continuity of normal ventilation cycles (>2 minutes), we reproduced a caricatural situation of obstruction by suddenly bending the endotracheal tube in order to totally interrupt the air flow (see Supplementary Video S1 andFigure 1A).
