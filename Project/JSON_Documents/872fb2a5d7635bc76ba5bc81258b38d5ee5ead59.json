However, longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional studies investigating the role of lockdown restrictions on mental health are rare although such studies promise to be highly useful to identify persons at risk to develop increased anxiety and depression (Daly, Sutin, & Robinson, 2020; Debowska, Horeczy, Boduszek, & Dolinski, 2020) . This study aimed at examining whether symptoms of depression and anxiety were increased during v. before the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany, whether symptoms remained elevated after lockdown restrictions were eased, and whether the observed effects were predicted by sociodemographic variables.",

However, anxiety was increased during the easing v. peak of restrictions in younger v. older individuals, in men v. women, in students/ individuals in training v. employed individuals and in individuals without v. with children (see Table 1 ). Depression during easing v. peak of lockdown measures was higher in men v. women. The symptom difference in depression (with lower symptoms during easing v. peak of lockdown measures) was greater in individuals with v. without a history of mental disorders. The results suggest that implementation of lockdown restrictions is associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety that even persist during ease of lockdown in specific groups. Men and individuals without a history of mental disorders were particularly affected by lockdown restrictions. The results are consistent with previous longitudinal studies from the UK, which demonstrated that younger individuals experienced higher levels of distress due to lockdown measures (Daly et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020) . This study identifies vulnerable groups (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020; Benke et al., 2020; Jungmann & Witth\u00f6ft, 2020) , which might need tailored support to avoid exacerbation or the development of manifest psychological disorders.
