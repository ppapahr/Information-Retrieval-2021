Matava et al. 1 demonstrated the use of plastic drapes to limit droplet exposure during extubations. Another report described the clinical impact of an \"aerosol box\" to shield providers during intubation but also noted restricted arm movement along with the possible need for removal during a difficult intubation. 2 In contrast to the aerosol box ( fig. 1A ), we sought materials readily available in most operating rooms to take a pragmatic and economical approach to reducing exposure during aerosol-generating procedures. Our Mayo-draped containment setup consists of a clear plastic drape suspended over a patient by a Mayo stand ( fig. 1B) . In this report, we assess ease of intubation and evaluate droplet containment for both systems.",

This is placed over the Mayo stand and secured with clips to create a barrier covering the patient's head. A plastic disposal bag is secured to the stand legs, and the Mayo tray is omitted for visualization from multiple angles. Two vertical 6-inch slits, separated at least 12 inches apart, are cut in the plastic for hand placement ( fig. 1B ). After use, the plastic drapes are discarded by inward rolling of the contaminated surfaces.",

A significant difference was noted in the droplet distribution during the simulation of an extubation cough. The caudal opening of the aerosol box allowed considerable droplet spread, contaminating the bedside assistant ( fig. 2A ). With the Mayo-draped containment setup, the caudally directed droplets were contained within the drape ( fig. 2B) .",

With concerns for nosocomial COVID-19 infection, we find the simple design of the Mayo-draped containment setup to have clinical value in facilitating ease of intubation and limiting droplet spread compared to the aerosol box.",
