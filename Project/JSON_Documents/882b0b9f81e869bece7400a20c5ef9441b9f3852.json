            "text": "In the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), scripts orchestrate the collaborative learning (CL) process to achieve meaningful interactions among the students and so improve the learning outcomes. Nevertheless, the use of scripts may cause motivational problems over time. To deal with this issue, we propose the gamification of scripted CL sessions through an ontology that encodes knowledge from game design practices and theories of motivation and human behavior. This knowledge may be used by intelligent theory-aware systems to avoid the one-size-fits-all approach, providing support for the personalization of gamification. In this paper, we reported the results obtained in an empirical study to validate our ontology-based gamification of scripted CL sessions. Findings from this study indicate that intrinsic motivation, perceived choice, and effort/importance of students were significantly better when our ontology was used to support the gamification. The learning outcomes were significantly better in scripted CL sessions gamified through our approach, with positive correlations to the intrinsic motivation and perceived choice. Based on these results, we can state that the use of ontologies provides adequate support to carry out well-thought-out gamification of scripted sessions.",

Despite these benefits, motivational problems may occur when a scripted CL session has a high degree of coercion/imposition. For example, when there is an over-scripting [17] , the CL sessions limit the students' behaviors and actions, causing a lack of motivation because the students may feel forced to follow an unwilling sequence of interactions. To deal with this motivational problem, and others (such as the lack of interest in the contentdomain, and the learners' preference to work individually), Gamification \"as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts\" [16] has been pointed out as a novelty approach to engaging students in educational contexts [4] . However, gamification is too context-dependent [19, 29] , so that its benefits depend on how well the game elements are linked with the pedagogical objectives of CL sessions. Gamifying CL sessions is a non-trivial task, and when the game elements are not tailored using the one-size-fits-all approach, as was indicated in other contexts, may cause detrimental to students' motivation [2] , cheating [27] , embarrassment [28] , and lack of credibility [13] .",

Without a common representation of this knowledge in a manner that can be understood for computers, we can not build intelligent systems that support the interpretation of theories and practices related to gamification. These intelligent theory-aware systems are also responsible to guide the instructional designers in the personalization of gamification, where the theories and practices of gamification may be used to predict the effects of a gamification design in the students' motivation and engagement, and with this information, these systems can suggest the gameelements and their design that best fit for each student in a scripted CL session. Thus, employing a top-down ontology engineering approach and the model of roles proposed in [26] , we developed an ontology named OntoGaCLeS 1 (detailed in [8, 10] ) in which we defined structures to encode theories and practices that support the well-thought-out gamification of scripted CL sessions.",

We conducted this validation through an empirical study in which the first author mediated the interaction between the instructional designers and our ontology (simulating, thus, an intelligent system that supports the gamification process through ontologies). After to present the related work in Sect. 2, Sect. 3 delineates our ontology-based gamification of scripted CL sessions.

We previously conducted two empirical studies [6, 9] to explore the benefits of our proposed ontology-based gamification (Sect. 3). Finding in these studies showed that our approach significantly increases students' intrinsic motivation, interest/enjoyment and perceived choice when it is compared with non-gamified CL sessions. These studies also indicated that our approach reduces the students' pressure/tension, and that the dropping-out percentage of students per group is reduced through the gamification of CL sessions.",

The 1 st step is to set the player roles & game elements for each student of the CL session based on motivational theories and player type models. This step is performed by selecting a gamification design that best fits the individual motivational goals and game-player preferences of all the students. In the ontology, the gamification designs are encoded as \"Motivational strategy\" into ontological structures to represent gamified CL sessions, so that an algorithm may be used to search the ontological structures that have the same pattern of individual motivational goals of students. These goals are represented in these structures as \"I-mot goal (I)\" -an ontological concept encoded from motivational theories, and in which we represented the expected changes in the students' motivation at the end of the scripted CL session. Figure 1 exemplifies the ontology-based gamification of a scripted CL session inspired by the theory \"Cognitive Apprenticeship\" [11] , and delineated for two students L A and L B . For this example, the ontological structure \"Gamified Cognitive Apprenticeship for Yee Achiever/Yee Socializer\" was selected to gamify this session because the individual motivational goals of the student L A match with the structures \"I-mot goal (I)\" shown in the frame (a) of Fig. 1 . These structures represent the satisfaction of competence need and the internalization of motivation -both structures encoded from the SDT theory [14] that states that feeling challenged and being effective to do something cause the experience of control, making a person to be intrinsically motivated. Thus, as exemplified in Fig. 1 , an adequate gamification design for the student L A with the need of competence is encoded as the motivational strategy \"Gamifying by CMPT/CMPR\" (Gamifying a scripted CL session by providing an environment with competition and comparison with others).",

These effects may also consequence of the personalization of game-elements based on information from player models and the persuasive game design applied to these game-elements.

The perceived choice and effort/importance of students in ont-gamified were greater in ontgamified CL sessions than in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions. A possible explanation for this fact is that students in our ont-gamified CL sessions put more effort in their actions and behaviors to be properly rewarded by the game elements because the GMIF model provides an adequate balance between the current students' skill/knowledge and perceived challenge, a balance that was not established in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions.",

The tukey post-hoc comparisons show that the students' intrinsic motivation in ontgamified CL sessions (lsmean = 4.56, SE = 0.149) was significantly greater than in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 4.10, SE = 0.149) with a p-adj. value of p = 0.023 and Hedges' g = 0.63 medium effect size. The perceived choice in ont-gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 4.80, SE = 0.295) was significantly greater than in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 3.60, SE = 0.295) with p = 0.009 and g = 0.75 medium effect size. The effort/importance in ont-gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 5.32, SE = 0.246) was significantly greater than in onesize-fits-all gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 4.37, SE = 0.245) with p = 0.007 and g = 0.79 medium effect size.Learning Outcomes: According to the ANOVA tests, the effect on the students' skill/knowledge gain yielded F (1, 45) = 10.77 with p = 0.002 indicating a significant difference between one-size-fits-all gamification and ontologybased gamification of scripted CL sessions. The Tukey post-hoc comparisons indicate that the students' skill/knowledge gain in ont-gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 1.38, SE = 0.578) was greater than in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions (lsmean = \u22121.26, SE = 0.564) with p = 0.002 and g = 0.88 medium effect size. For Apprentice students, their skill/knowledge gain in ont-gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 2.50, SE = 0.638) was also greater than in one-size-fits-all gamified CL sessions (lsmean = 0.07, SE = 0.585) with p = 0.036 and g = 0.892 large effect size.",
