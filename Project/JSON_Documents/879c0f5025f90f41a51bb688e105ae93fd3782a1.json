Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. The ICU mortality rate among those who required non-invasive ventilation in one case series in China was 79% and among those who required invasive mechanical ventilation was 86% 15 . The fundamental pathophysiology of infection with COVID-19 potentially resulting in such critical outcomes is \"cytokine storm syndrome\" with ARDS and fulminate myocarditis 20 with multiorgan dysfunction 7 acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and pneumothorax 21 . A hyperinflammatory syndrome known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can also result from fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia 22 . Pulmonary involvement in patients with HLH/MAS revealed that dyspnea and cough were the most common symptoms at the onset of the disease, and radiographs revealed interstitial infiltrates with centrilobular nodules, ill-defined consolidation, or localized ground-glass opacities 23 . Similar radiological abnormalities are seen in patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, where initial lung findings on chest CT revealed small subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation up to two weeks after disease onset, eventually being absorbed resulting in extensive GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands 24 . Chest radiographs and imaging results of patients with MERS Cov also have also shown features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia, which are different however from SARS, which show more of a fibrocellular intra-alveolar organization with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like pattern 9 .",

These levels are substantially increased by therapy with intravenous NAC with measurable clinical responses to treatment regarding increased oxygen delivery, improved lung compliance and resolution of pulmonary edema 45 . The alveolar epithelial lining fluid of patients with ARDS has also been shown to be deficient in total GSH compared to normal subjects, where reactive oxygen species may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the acute lung injury with ARDS 46 . Since patients with ARDS are subjected to an increased burden of oxidants in the alveolar fluid, principally released by recruited neutrophils, this deficiency of GSH may predispose these patients to enhanced lung cell injury. Glutathione is one of the body's master antioxidants which has been shown to play an important role in antioxidant defense, nutrient metabolism, and regulation of cellular events, including cytokine production and immune response 47 . We therefore performed a trial of glutathione precursors, i.e. NAC, antioxidants (alpha lipoic acid, Vitamin C) along with 2-gram doses of PO and/or IV glutathione in 2 patients suffering from dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia who were previously on antibiotic treatment for COVID 19 pneumonia with mixed results.",

Other effects of Vitamin C include increased functioning of phagocytes, proliferation of T-lymphocytes and production of interferon, while decreasing the replication of viruses 67 . Alpha lipoic was administered simultaneously with Vitamin C, which apart from being an antioxidant and inhibiting airway inflammation 41 , increases GSH through release from oxidized glutathione, increasing GSH synthesis, while activating the transcription factor Nrf2, and lowering expression of NF-kappa B 68 . Finally, NAC, a precursor of glutathione, was given at PO doses ranging from 1200 to 2400 mg/day, as it has been shown to lower the inflammatory response in patients with community acquired pneumonia in a randomized controlled trial 69 while increasing intracellular GSH and improving acute respiratory distress syndrome 70 .",

It is therefore possible that by administering large doses of NAC and glutathione, along with zinc, Vitamin C and Nrf2 activators, we lowered oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, resulting in a rapid improvement in dyspnea and clinical symptomatology. A limitation of our study, apart from the small sample size however, is that we were unable to do laboratory testing in our patients, including checking oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxides) as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and LDH which might demonstrate a change post GSH administration 76 77 78 . A randomized, controlled trial of GSH, glutathione precursors with inflammatory/oxidative stress markers should be done in the future to fully elucidate the effects of blocking NF-kappaB, and to determine the effect of GSH and antioxidants on the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS.",

In preclinical models of sepsis and acute lung injury, associated with rapid and large increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, suppression of NF-\u03baB activation has been shown to result in improved survival 81 82 . NAC, alpha-lipoic acid and GSH all inhibit TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. Oral and IV glutathione as well as glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine, alpha-lipoic acid) may, therefore, represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing \"cytokine storm syndrome\" and respiratory distress in patients suffering with COVID 19 pneumonia. Zinc, vitamin C and NRF 2 activators may also be helpful in decreasing the inflammatory response and lowering cytokine production. Randomized controlled trials should be performed to evaluate the efficacy of these novel therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS.",

Both patients had a history of Lyme disease (LD) and associated tickborne co-infections. Patient 1 had a history of persistent LD symptoms with a history of coinfections (Anaplasma, Babesia) with positive autoimmune markers after a short course of treatment in prior years, consistent with an underlying chronic inflammatory response. The second patient had a history of LD and Bartonella henselae, with prior exposure to Rickettsia rickettsii, and Rickettsia typhi when she began treatment. Neither patient needed to be excluded from the prescribed combination therapy based on their medical history, as there was no allergy or intolerance to any medication or supplement, and no history of significant cardiac arrhythmias and/or QT prolongation on an electrocardiogram.Case StudiesCase history 1: The patient is a 53-year-old white male with a past medical history (PMH) significant for Lyme disease (positive IgM Western blot), Anaplasmosis, babesiosis, prior exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus, with a history of intestinal parasites. Exposure risk for tick-borne infections included frequent travel to highly Lyme endemic areas on Long Island. PMH also included frequently elevated mercury levels in the blood, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, adrenal fatigue, low testosterone, low vitamin D, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic insomnia. Significant autoimmune/inflammatory markers included a history of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) ranging between 1:40 and 1:320, positive rheumatoid factors (103, normal range less than 6) with a negative cyclic citrullinated peptide, and positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies. All other autoimmune markers were negative including negative single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, Sjogren's and Smith antibodies.After several months of treatment with antibiotics during the time period of 2011 to 2012, the patient remained in relatively good health. He was never completely symptom free from his tick-borne infections but was able to work at a high intensity job in the financial industry and did not require follow-up with our medical practice until 8 years later. Western blots showed old exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi with evidence of several Lyme specific bands.He was seen again in January 2020 when his old Lyme symptoms began to relapse with moderate fatigue, insomnia (only sleeping 6 to 7 hours per night), occasional migratory pain in the muscles and joints, including low back, shoulders, ankles and feet, along with mild tremors and mild cognitive dysfunction. The patient stated that he was feeling approximately 85% of his normal functioning and repeat labs were performed. His Lyme C6 Elisa was negative, IgM and IgG immunoblot were negative with a negative PCR for Borrelia burgdorferi, along with negative Babesia testing and negative testing for other tickborne co-infections. Rheumatoid factor (IgM) was initially elevated at 154, ANA was positive at 1:320 (reference range less than 1:40) with a normal high-sensitivity CRP and normal ferritin level. All other autoimmune markers were negative. Mercury level in the blood was elevated at 15.3 (normal range less than 10 ug/L), and Lead level was 1 in the blood (normal range 0 -4 ug/dL). A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic profile were within normal limits, as were immunoglobulin levels (IGA, IgM and IgG) and mineral levels (iodine, zinc, copper, magnesium). Hormone precursors were low, with low levels of pregnenolone (15, normal range 22 -237 ng/DL), low levels of unconjugated Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (87, normal range 147 -1760 ng/deciliter), low total testosterone levels (232, reference range 250 -1100 ng/deciliter) and a low normal level of cortisol in the blood(8.4    \u00b5g/deciliter, range between 4 and 22).",

Over the past three years, she received treatment for her tick-borne illness, and had a dramatic improvement. She had been symptom-free and off treatment for the past year, and prior to falling ill with COVID-19, the patient was healthy and eating a balanced diet with no notable health complaints.On Sunday, March 22, 2020, the patient woke up with 103\u00b0F, severe dyspnea at rest that worsened with exertion, dry cough, chest tightness, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, severe fatigue, body pains, weakness, shallow breathing, and anosmia. The patient was taken to the emergency room, where they performed a chest x-ray which showed \"hazy opacities and peribronchial thickening in the left mid and lower lung field concerning for pneumonia, possible atypical\". The patient was not tested for COVID-19 in the ER at the time of the X-ray due to the unavailability of testing in NYC. She was given a loading dose of 500 mg of azithromycin in the emergency room and discharged with a diagnosis of \"Suspected 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection and Atypical Pneumonia\".On Monday, March 23, 2020, the patient was started on a combination therapy of azithromycin 250 mg PO q12h, and a loading dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg PO q12h, followed by maintenance doses of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg TID \u00d7 9 days. Two days later, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875-125 mg PO q12h was added for extended coverage of the pneumonia as her dyspnea persisted. During antibiotic therapy from March 23 rd to March 30th, the patient experienced gradual improvement but still complained of lingering symptoms of diarrhea and respiratory symptoms including a cough, dyspnea at rest that worsened with exertion, shallow breathing, inability to take a deep breath, and chest tightness.On March 31, reduced, liposomal glutathione was added to her antibiotic regimen along with 50 mg of zinc and 1-gram TID of Vitamin C.

A home nursing service was subsequently hired to administer IV fluids, as the patient became increasingly dehydrated secondary to significant night sweats and diarrhea with difficulty keeping down fluids. Two grams of IV glutathione was subsequently administered with one liter of 0.9% normal saline, along with PO Pedialyte for electrolyte replacement. Oxygen via nasal cannula, up to 3 liters per minute for several hours per day was used PRN for dyspnea.
