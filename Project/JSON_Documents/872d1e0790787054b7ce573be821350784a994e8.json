Methods: During the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, 2286 respondents (1706 females and 580 males; age range: 18-74 years) completed an online survey that collected sociodemographic information and data related to the experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some questionnaires assessed sleep quality, psychological well-being, general psychopathology, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders symptoms, and anxiety. The path analysis was adopted. Results: The study confirms a direct effect of some aspects ascribable to the pandemic, with a mediator role of the psychological variables. Lower sleep quality was directly related to the days spent at home in confinement and the knowledge of people affected by the COVID-19. All the other aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced sleep quality through the mediator effect of psychological variables. Conclusion: This study highlighted that the psychological condition of the population has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government actions taken to contain it, but it has also played an important role in mediating the quality of sleep, creating a vicious circle on people's health. The results suggest that a health emergency must be accompanied by adequate social support programs to mitigate the fear of infection and promote adequate resilience to accept confinement and social distancing. Such measures would moderate psychological distress and improve sleep quality.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic severely impacted the worldwide population, involving aspects closely related to physical health, political, social, economic, and psychological conditions. [1] [2] [3] Italy was one of the first and most affected countries. The rapid spread of the virus led the Italian government to implement exceptional containment measures of social distancing, including social isolation and home confinement, between March and May 2020. 4, 5 Likewise, several governments have adopted the same measures. 4 COVID-19 pandemic affected the psychological well-being of the general population. Several studies documented the mental-health outcomes of the pandemic, particularly reporting an increase of distress, [6] [7] [8] Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders' symptoms (PTSD), 9, 10 anxiety, 11,12 mood diseases, 11, 12 and sleep disorders. 8, 13 In Italy, different authors confirmed similar trends about the psychological impact of the pandemic. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Moreover, pandemic caused changes in daily habits and lifestyles (eg, eating habits, physical activity, and leisure activity [21] [22] [23] ) linked to the more or less severe containment measures that exacerbated the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. 23 One of the aspects highly affected by the pandemic was sleep. 16, 24, 25 Different studies evidenced alteration in both sleep quality and quantity. A recent meta-analysis reported a prevalence of 32.2% of sleep disorders among the general population. 26 During the pandemic, modifications in sleep patterns, such as increased sleep medication use, higher prevalence of insomnia, and a general decrease of perceived sleep quality were reported in association with lifestyle changes due to the confinement. 16, 24, 25 . Moreover, sleep disturbances were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression and a greater incidence of psychiatric disorders. 26 In Italy, an online survey conducted during the first 2 weeks of lockdown reported poor sleep quality in about six respondents out of ten (57.1%). 16 Moreover, the mean scores of the questionnaire for the self-assessment of sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) 27, adopted by the study, indicated greater sleep disturbances in the respondents' sample than normative data from the general population. Other Italian studies reported similar results. 15, 20, 24, [28] [29] [30] For example, Marelli et al 15 reported increased sleep disturbances and insomnia, particularly in students and workers. Cellini and colleagues 24 highlighted an alteration in sleep quality related to the changes in habits due to the home confinement, especially when high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptomatology were reported. Furthermore, Salfi and colleagues 28 underlined that the Italian population transversely presented significant sleep disturbance after the stressful lockdown period due to the pandemic.",

Sleep quality has a bidirectional relationship with stress, anxiety, and mood alteration. 31 On the one hand, sleep disturbances exacerbate psychological distress; on the other hand, anxiety and depression impair the usual sleep habits. 31, 32 Many studies have assessed the different aspects of sleep by providing important information about its association with the pandemic 33 -such as the prevalence of sleep disturbance in different populations 8, 15, 34 and the potential risk factors for poor sleep quality during lockdown (eg, gender, level of education, occupational condition, social capital). 35,36, However, no research has  integrated the psychological variables into a model capable to associate the pandemic dimensions and the quality  of sleep. Moreover, it has never been clarified whether COVID-19-related variables (such as the diagnosis, the confinement, etc.) influenced sleep quality directly or indirectly and whether other aspects (such as mental-health variables) modulated it. The COVID-19 and the consequent measures taken to contain it could directly or indirectly alter sleep quality. Many psychological dimensions could play a relevant role in this relationship. Understanding indirect associations of COVID-19 pandemic, more than direct ones, would allow scheduling, specific interventions to improve the general population's sleep quality.",

However, no study has clarified whether this impairment of sleep quality was directly determined by the variables associated with COVID-19 (eg, the risk of infection; the confinement at home) or whether it was due to the altered psychological condition caused by the pandemic. Accordingly, this study examined the role of different psychological variables (psychological well-being, COVID-19 PTSD related symptoms, psychological symptomatology, and state of anxiety) as potential mediators of the relationship between some aspects specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, to have a COVID-19 diagnosis, number of days spent at home after the confinement measures, knowledge of people affected at different degrees by COVID-19) and self-reported sleep quality in an Italian sample during the lockdown. The principal objectives were to clarify whether some COVID-19related aspects, directly and indirectly, affect sleep quality during this health emergency through their influence on psychological states. Results confirm a direct effect of some aspects ascribable to the pandemic. 16, 18 The first period of the pandemic spread in Italy and, consequently, the first phase of the lockdown, the confinement at home, and the consequential social distancing, directly impaired the participants' sleep quality. COVID-19-related aspect and the confinement at home also affected the participants' psychological condition, confirming a mediator role of psychological distress (PGWB), PTSD symptoms (COVID-19-PTSD), and psychological symptoms (SCL-90) on self-reported sleep quality.",

The uncertainty or the confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis indirectly influences, via psychological dimensions, sleep quality.

[16] [17] [18] 50 Moreover, these symptoms would be directly related to sleep quality. 51, 52 These results appear important and need to be considered from a clinical perspective given the findings that detected high rates of COVID-related PTSD in the worldwide and Italian populations. 9, 18, 53, 54 A similar trend was reported considering the psychological symptomatology measured with SCL-90. The COVID-19 emergency exacerbates the psychopathological symptoms, in line with previous evidence that compared psychopathological symptoms measured during the COVID-19 pandemic with normative data from the general population. 18 In this study, we underlined the influence of the psychopathological condition on sleep quality without ignoring the role of COVID-19 experience and reporting a strong link between the environmental situation and the psychological condition. The general psychological well-being that, inversely, can be considered as an index of psychological distress, again, acts as a mediator of the relationship between COVID-19 variables and sleep quality.

First, the sample's recruitment was carried out with an online survey, and the poor control of self-reported measures represents a limit in the path model generalizability. The cross-sectional design is another limit because it did not allow understanding the causal nature of the relationship and whether this relationship is confirmed or modulated over time and with the changes in the pandemic situation. However, the study aimed to highlight the Italian population's state in the first days after the lockdown; therefore, a longitudinal design was impossible to use. Furthermore, greater control of potentially confounding variables such as gender, occupational status, age, medical conditions, lifestyle changes involving health behavior (eg, sedentary behavior, maladaptive eating habits) should be done according to the results of previous studies highlighting the role of certain demographic or lifestyle variables as possible risk factors for sleep quality. 9 Moreover, the adoption of a self-report measure to evaluate the quality and quantity of sleep might represent a limit in reliability and may not highlight specific characteristics of the sleep pattern during a pandemic. Similarly, the adoption of a questionnaire to assess psychological variables could not identify mental illnesses, representing a further limitation of the study.",

In this study, the central focus was on the quality of sleep, which directly influences many daily activities, and it is involved, at multiple levels, in the psychological, 55,56 cognitive 57,58 and physical 59 well-being of individuals. Interventions to promote a good quality of sleep and reduce sleep disorders in these critical phases cannot ignore aspects such as distress, psychological symptoms, and PTSD symptoms. All these aspects, being influenced by the COVID-19 experience and being mediators of the impact on sleep quality, must be well evaluated before implementing interventions to solve sleep diseases related to this extraordinary event, both in the medium and long terms.",

However, our results show that this emergency and the social distancing and confinement at home norms lead to psychological diseases that worsen sleep quality.
