Vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length IBV cDNA has the advantage that modifications can be introduced into the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. Here, we describe the use of transient dominant selection as a method for introducing modifications into the IBV cDNA that has been successfully used for the substitution of specific nucleotides, deletion of genomic regions, and the exchange of complete genes. Infectious recombinant IBVs are generated in situ following the transfection of vaccinia virus DNA, containing the modified IBV cDNA, into cells infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gamma-coronavirus that is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis (IB); an acute and high contagious disease of poultry. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which replicate in the cell cytoplasm. Coronavirus genomes consist of single-stranded positive-sense RNA and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27 kb to 32 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. This was followed by the in situ recovery of infectious IBV in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [1] .",

            "text": "One of the main advantages of using vaccinia virus as a vector for IBV cDNA is its ability to accept large quantities of foreign DNA without loss of integrity and stability [2] . A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection (TDS), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [3, 4] . The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case, we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 ( Fig. 1 ; [5] ), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt; [6] ), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K early/ late promoter. Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the recombination vector for insertion of genes into a vaccinia virus genome using TDS. Plasmid pGPTNEB193 contains the Ecogpt selection gene under the control of the vaccinia virus early/late P 7.5K promoter, a multiple cloning region for the insertion of the sequence to be incorporated into the vaccinia virus genome and the bla gene (not shown) for ampicillin selection of the plasmid in E. coli. For the modification of the IBV genome, a sequence corresponding to the region being modified, plus flanking regions of 500-800 nucleotides for recombination purposes is inserted into the multiple cloning sites using an appropriate restriction endonuclease. The plasmid is purified from E. coli and transfected into Vero cells previously infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome In the second step, this complete plasmid sequence is integrated into the IBV sequence within the vaccinia virus genome (Fig. 2) . This occurs as a result of a single cross-over event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. The resulting recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) are highly unstable due to the presence of duplicate sequences and are only maintained by the selective pressure of the Ecogpt gene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine [3] . In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in the loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a second single homologous recombination event between the duplicated sequences (Fig. 2) . During this Fig. 2 The incorporation of the IBV S gene using transient dominant selection. Transient dominant selection is used to modify the cDNA copy of the IBV genome encoded by an rVV [1] . To modify the IBV genome, a plasmid is required that contains a GPT gene as well as the desired IBV-derived sequence. For the insertion of the S gene into an IBV genome missing the S gene, the plasmid contains the S gene flanked by neighboring sequence in nsp 16 and gene 3 [2] . Recombination occurs between the homologous IBV sequences in the plasmid vector and the IBV cDNA, resulting in the complete plasmid sequence inserting into the rVV genome, thereby creating, due to the presence of duplicate sequences, a highly unstable intermediate [3] . The presence of the GPT gene allows for the selection and isolation of this highly unstable intermediate through plaque purification in the presence of selection agents MPA, xanthine and hypoxanthine [4] . Once the selective pressure is removed, a second homologous recombination event occurs that either results in the generation of an rVV containing the original unmodified IBV sequence or the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification; in this example the insertion of the S gene third step two recombination events can occur; one event will result in the generation of the original (unmodified) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification (i.e., the modification within the plasmid sequence). In theory these two events will occur at equal frequency; however, in practice this is not necessarily the case.",

The generation of the Ecogpt plasmids, based on pGPTNEB193, containing the modified IBV cDNA, is by standard E. coli cloning methods [9, 10] and will not be described here. General methods for growing vaccinia virus have been published by Mackett et al. [11] and for using the TDS method for modifying the vaccinia virus genome by Smith [ [1] . Primary CK cells are infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus which expresses a T7 RNA polymerase (rFPV-T7) [2] . Cells are subsequently co-transfected with recombinant vaccinia DNA encoding the desired IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 RNA promotor, and a plasmid (pCi-Nuc) expressing the IBV N protein under the control of both a cytomegalovirus (CMV) RNA polymerase II promoter and a T7 RNA promoter [3] . The rFPV-T7 derived RNA polymerase generates both the N protein from pCi-Nuc, and infectious IBV RNA from the rVV DNA. This in turn [4] initiates an IBV replication cycle resulting [5] in the generation of recombinant IBV (rIBV 12.

When performing a rescue using rIBVs that cannot be propagated in CK cells, the infected cell lysate must also be harvested at this stage. To harvest the cell lysate, add 500-600 \u03bcl CK maintenance media per well, and freeze at \u00c080 C. Immediately before passaging, thaw the lysate and titurate, no more than five times, using a needle and syringe, and filter to remove the rFPV-T7. This technique to break open the cells is harsh and will potentially damage any recovered rIBV. It is therefore strongly advised that the processed cell lysate is immediately taken forward for passaging, without a further freeze-thaw. 15 . For rIBVs that cannot be propagated in CK cells, it is also possible to passage in 10-day old SPF embryonated hen's eggs. This has been successfully tried for several rIBVs [15] . Typically, for the first passage, each egg would be inoculated with up to 300 \u03bcl of P 0 supernatant, or P 0 cell lysate and incubated for up to 48 h at 37 C. The embryonated eggs are chilled at 4 C for at least 4 h before the allantoic fluid is harvested. The harvested allantoic fluid is then taken forward to the next passage. 16 . There is always the possibility that the recovered rIBV is not cytopathic. In this case, check for the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR at P 3 . It is quite common even with a cytopathic rIBV not to see easily definable IBV-induced CPE at P 1 and P 2 . The recovery process is a low probability event and the serial passage of rIBVs in CK cells or embryonated eggs acts as an amplification step.",

Selection agents, MPA, xanthine and hypoxanthine, are added to the culture. Homologous recombination occurs, and the complete plasmid sequence is inserted into the rVV. The GPT gene allows positive selection of these rVV as it confers resistance to MPA in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The viruses are plaque purified three times in the presence of selection agents ensuring no wild-type VV is present. The removal of the selection agents results in a second recombination event with the loss of the GPT gene. Plaque purification in the absence of selection agents three times not only ensures the loss of the GPT gene but also ensures the maintenance of a single virus population. Small stocks of rVV are grown from individual plaques which are screened through PCR for the desired modification; this is found in theoretically 50% of rVVs",
