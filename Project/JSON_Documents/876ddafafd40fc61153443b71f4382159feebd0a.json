Despite the time and money invested in COVID-19 research and medical treatments around the world 4-8 , at the time of this writing, the diverse routes of transmission and effective treatment methods for this disease are still unclear. The fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been a concern 9 since the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients' feces 10 . However, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and its hazard to human health is an ongoing debate although high concentrations of viral RNA have been found in both patient's feces [11] [12] [13] and in human sewage 14 . Only a handful of papers 10, [15] [16] [17] reported the isolation of infectious viruses from feces on human tissue culture. The most recent report by Zang et al. 13 provides evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human small intestine but shows that most of ",

At the time of this analysis, only a handful of the studies quantified viral load in human feces using qPCR 11-12, 16, 32 . Pan et al. 32 reported 9 of 17 positive samples with a range of viral concentrations between 10 3 and 10 5 genome copies (gc) of viral RNA/mL of liquid stool sample (Table S1 ). The viral load varied over the course of the disease but was within 2 orders of magnitude. Wolfel et al. 11 reported positive detection in 68 of 81 samples over 21 days for multiple COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged between 10 2 and over 10 7 gc/ gram of feces (Table S1 ). More recently, Zheng et al. 12 followed patients for 60 days and detected 55 positive samples among 93 samples tested and reported the concentration in the range of less than 10 2 and over 10 8 gc/mL of feces (Table S1 ). Xiao et al. 16 followed a single patient and quantified the viral load in feces by qPCR but used a standard curve based on known plaque forming unit (pfu). The viral load was expressed as pfu equivalence /mL of feces but indicated that fecal viral load does not necessarily imply infectivity.",

This report explains the low frequency of viral isolation from fecal samples but it does not rule out the presence of infectious viruses in the patients' feces as demonstrated by the other studies. 10, 15-17 The rate of inactivation as the viruses passing through colon is likely dependent on time and protective effect of fecal material in colon. A fraction of viruses may survive the passage. Another contributor for the low frequency of fecal viral isolation on tissue culture may be due to the difficulties of measuring infectious virus in feces. Multiple purification steps are necessary to remove bacteria and other interferences before the samples can be loaded onto cell cultures. Such purification steps perhaps can inactivate or remove SARS-CoV-2. The methodological challenges can result in the uncertainties of the number of infectious virus in feces.

In comparison with the reports of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage from different municipal sewage treatment plants (median value of 5.23log 10 gc/L), the estimates based on fecal loading were much lower (Figure S2andTable S7). This result suggests that the fecal loading is either underestimated or sewage SARS-CoV-2 concentration is several orders overestimated. The underestimation of fecal viral load could be due to the methodological challenges relating to sample extraction and purification of viruses for qPCR. Since the uncertainty of this parameter plays a key role in the risk estimation, future data in this area will no doubt improve the confidence in the risk estimation.Regardless of the contribution of the conversion factor to model variability, the infectivity of the viruses shed in feces is a critical factor to establish the hazard in discussion. At the time of this writing, there are two sides of the expert opinions regarding the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces. One side believes that viruses shed in feces are mostly inactivated by colonic fluid 13 , therefore, there is low or no hazard from fecal shed virus. So far, there has not been any direct evidence to support fecal transmitted infection in human or in animal model for either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1. The conclusion from the Amory Gardens investigation was challenged by previous reports[58][59] . The other side of the opinion points to the successful isolation of infectious virus from fecal samples from the handful of presence and absence studies to support the hypothesis of fecal-oral transmission10,[15][16][17] . Several reports also indicate that viral shedding in feces long after patients recovered from COVID-19 and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. They suggested that prolonged viral shedding could J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pose repeated exposure risks to others even after the patient has recovered from disease34 . In addition to the case report of Amoy Gardens for SARS-CoV-1 transmission, two recent governmental reports from China concluded that fecal exposure was the likely source of COVID-19 transmission. One was a press release of the Infectious Disease Control Authority in the City of Guangzhou, China, which pin-pointed the COVID-19 patient feces as the source of infection of three families residing in the floor below a COVID-19 patient 63 . The second was a report by Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention identifying that an isolated incident of a COVID-19 case was linked to a known cluster of outbreak through a visit to a public bathroom64 . More research is needed to understand infectious potential of feces. We adopted the genome copy to infectious unit conversion of SARS-CoV-1 reported in the lab experiments as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2. It is important to point out that the SARS-CoV-1 used in these experiments was not derived from fecal samples[42][43] . They were lab viral cultures, and the relationship between genome copies and infectious units depended on the methods for virus preparation, the storage condition and time delay before the assay. If we believe the colonic fluid can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the conversation factor adopted from lab cultured viruses could be an overestimation of infectious virus in feces and the final risks. The conversion factor used in the model covers a range based on the lab experimental outcome but it may not be the right representation of fecal shed virus. The degree of uncertainty in this factor may not be adequately represented by the importance analysis. Until further data on infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces is made available, this is the best proxy for converting genome equivalent to infectious unit.The aerosol generation during toilet flushing has been well studied[20][21] . Aerosol concentration varies with types of toilet. The aerosol concentrations presented by O'Toole's J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study 44 are the best representation of the low flow toilet commonly installed in the multi-unit apartment buildings. The importance analyses indicated both aerosol concentration and dispersion in a room could have important impact on the risk outcomes. However, they were unlikely to change the magnitude of the risk that could match the risk outcome of Amoy Gardens. In comparison with the direct measurements of aerosols generated by toilet flushing, the dispersion of aerosols through a faulty drains is less certain. The commonly known sewer smell only provides indirect evidence for aerosol intake from the main sewer pipe to individual toilet rooms. We built a uniform distribution for the dispersion rate to capture the variability of this parameter. Additional research is needed to understand the building drainage system and aerosol transmission. Human dose-response model for SARS-CoV-2 requires intentionally exposing humans to known doses of SARS-CoV-2, which is unlikely due to the ethical concerns. Animal models may be developed in the future as that has been done for SARS-CoV-1. Although there are remarkable differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 during infection, the disease development shares similarity, which promotes us to use the SARS-CoV-1 model as the proxy. Analyses showed that this was a critical parameter of the risk model and contributed to a large degree of uncertainty in the risk outcome. Adjustment made in the through incorporation of enhanced affinity to cell receptor, did not dramatically increase the risk. The uncertainty was largely embedded in the original model parameter, where data were pooled from both the animal model and comparison with other coronavirus including HCoV-229E to generate the best fit . Together with viral load, k had the biggest impact on risk outcomes. However, even after removing the uncertainty of the dose-response relationship, the comparison of the exposure dose estimated by the model still could not resolve the large gap with the dose J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f estimation from Watanabe et al.",

Although uncertainties are inevitable, risk assessment should always be conducted in an iterative manner that allows refinement of the risk assessment question(s), key assumptions, and data used in the model. As the first attempt to understand the risk of a novel virus, we expect the risk analysis to offer the fundamental understanding of associated risk based on the risk analysis framework. The model and outcomes can be refined in the later time with the emergence of new data on the property of the virus, human and environmental interactions. The mismatch of the exposure dose and illness estimation of this study with Amoy Gardens' report is worthy of further investigation. Although the high end of the risk estimation does not exclude the transmission scenario, it has a lower possibility or is only under extreme conditions. The extreme conditions may include a partially stopped up drainage system that can trap human waste containing virus in the sewer pipe, overloading ventilating fan to draw contaminated aerosols constantly into the toilet room 19 . Therefore, attentions should be given to proper maintenance of building drainage systems during the outbreak of aerosol transmitted diseases. It should be noted that the existing indoor drainage systems, if used and maintained properly, are able to protect healthy habitants from the possible exposures to pathogens, which is validated by the lack of more incidents like Amoy Gardens. Recommendations such as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f keeping the toilet cover closed while flushing to prevent the aerosols from being splashed into the air, and a regular inspection of water seals to prevent the aerosols in drainage pipes from being released into the indoor air could be made to further reduce the risk. Such simple habits could effectively keep habitants from microbial risks associated with the building drainage system. The toilet flushing and faulty floor drain scenarios are examples of potential hazards of the fecal contamination derived risk. The aerosolization of fecal derived virus can also be applied to risk analysis in shared public restrooms since the restroom can be filled with aerosols generated by multiple toilet flushes within a short time window. The viral concentration in the air could be significantly higher if there were large numbers of COVID-19 patients or asymptomatic carriers using the restroom (maybe closer to the direct measurements in the Wuhan Hospital toilet room). Another potential application is to look into the aerosol generation from aerated sewage during wastewater treatment process to estimate the risk of personnel working in wastewater treatment plants.
