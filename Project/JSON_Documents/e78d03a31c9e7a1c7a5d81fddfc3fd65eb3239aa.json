A SRL was performed in PubMed and Embase searching terms corresponding to the \"PEO\" format (Population=adult patients affected with COVID-19, Exposure=gender; Outcome=any available clinical outcomes by gender, including mortality and disease severity), search dates 01/01/2020-31/04/2020. Exclusion criteria were: case reports/series, reviews, commentaries, language other than English. We included full-text original articles. Data about study type, country, patients characteristics were extracted. Study quality was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). From a total of 950 hits generated by databases search, 85 articles fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected. Results: A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to compare mortality, recovery rates and disease severity in men versus women. Male to female ratio was 1: 0.8. A significant association between male sex and mortality (OR=1.81; 95%CI: 1.25-2.62), as well as a lower chance of recovery in men (OR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.55-0.95). Male patients had a higher odd to present with a severe form of COVID-19 (OR=1.46; 95%CI: 1.10-1.94). Conclusions: male are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, present with a more severe disease and have a worse prognosis. Further studies are warranted to unravel biological mechanisms underlying these observations.",

Full-length genome sequencing from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak unravelled the discovery of a novel coronavirus, with a high homology with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus was thus named SARS-CoV-2 (initially provisionally designated as 2019-nCoV), and shortly after its characterization it started to spread rapidly outside China. The disease caused by SARS-Cov2 (Coronavirus disease 2019, immediately raised concerned for its ability to cause severe illness with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure possibly resulting in death [2] . Furthermore, the quickness in human-to-human transmission required prompt adoption of containment measures [3] .",

On one hand, from a social standpoint, most health care workers are women in several world region, including Americas, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Furthermore, they have a predominant role in family caring in many countries [5] . Thus, they could represent highly exposed individuals. On the other hand, from a biological standpoint, men might be less favoured: for example, a high expression of the cell entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), used by SARS-CoV2 to invade human cells, has been demonstrated in Leydig and Sertoli Cells [6] . This could be one of the explanations for the claimed higher mortality in men, highlighted by some reports [7, 8] .",

Two studies were instead not included in the meta-analysis because they only presented a group of deceased patients, thus it was not possible to derive data from survivors [21, 22] . Data pooling resulted in a significant association between male sex and mortality (OR=1.81; 95%CI: 1.25-2.62) (Forrest plot represented in Figure 2, A) . Among the included studies, two were conducted in the general population, while 11 included only hospitalized patients, with one specifically focusing on intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Sensitivity analyses were therefore conducted in these different populations to assess the robustness of our result. In the hospitalized patients not admitted to ICU, as well as in the general population, a significantly higher chance of death in males was confirmed Only one study on patients admitted to the ICU was available, thus a meta-analysis was not possible J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [19] .

Another work by Li et al highlighted that males had a higher Hazard Rate for mortality even after adjustment for age, blood leukocyte count, LDH, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and administration of corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and umifenovir (HR 1.72; 95%CI 1.05-2.82, p=0.032). Accordingly, female sex was found to be protective for in hospital death [20] . Male sex seemed not to be independently associated, instead, to ICU admission in a retrospective study [36] .",

Differences in disease expression were limited to a higher prevalence of headache and more favourable laboratory examinations in females. In particular, females had a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocite ratio (NLR), ferritin, transaminase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, kidney function indices, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin [16] . On the subject of laboratory examinations, one work investigated the prognostic value of N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (nt-proBNP) on COVID-19 mortality: significant differences between male and females were not highlighted in this marker, although Nt-proBNP per se was a significant predictor of in-hospital death [37] . Fan et al showed instead that elevated transaminase and cholestasic enzymes were associated to a longer hospital stay, and that patients J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f presenting these abnormalities were more frequently males than females [38] . When evaluating NLR, it was found that, in male sex, NLR was significantly associated to mortality, whereas the same was not observed in female sex [39] .",

Since some important immune regulatory genes are located in the X chromosome, female individuals -equipped with two copies-might be advantaged due to a higher expression of Toll Like Receptor-7 (TLR7), which is crucial in the defence against viral infections.

Beside, a pooled effect size for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mortality risk in male had not been calculated: the results of our work suggest that male patients affected with COVID-19 have an overall 61% higher chance to die from the infection than their female peers. Importantly, this difference seems to hold despite the setting: general population or hospitalized patients. This, again, points toward a biological explanations for the different infection outcome in male and females. It has been observed that, in the most severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 can induce an exaggerated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (named \"cytokine storm\" or better \"secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\"-sHLH), possibly leading to multi organ failure and death [43] . This mechanism might be less frequently triggered in women, as a lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 has been observed in women, despite a prompter and more effective anti-viral response [41] .",

Thus, at the end of the study, a consistent proportion of patients might still be hospitalized. In this context, the recovery rate could also give an indication about patients that were discharged more rapidly versus those still hospitalized. This analysis confirmed, again, that male sex was negatively associated to recovery in the observation period.

It is conceivable that disease phenotype, and thus severity, might be influenced by hormonal factors. In fact, a study conducted in nine pregnant women infected with COVID-19 highlighted that high estrogen levels and increased estrogen receptor signaling was not associated with severe disease [45] . Consistently with this observation, previous animal studies on SARS-CoV found that the estrogen depletion, by ovariectomy or treatment with estrogen receptor antagonist, in infected female mice dramatically increased morbidity and mortality [46] . It might be reasonable to hypothesize this could also apply to SARS-CoV-2. The importance of estrogen in the immune response to virus is linked to the presence of estrogen receptors on the surface of innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. Via this receptor, the production of type I and III interferon by innate immune cells, which is crucial to decrease virus titres, is enhanced [47] . This even brought to the proposal of hormone replacement therapy as a potential treatment aimed at limiting COVID-19 severity [47] . An additional risk factor in males could be represented by the testis, as the analysis of transcription patterns of ACE2 found this receptor is primarily expressed in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. ACE2-positive spermatogonia express a higher number of genes associated with viral reproduction and transmission, and a lower number of genes related to spermatogenesis [6] . Thus, multiple biological explanations might hold for the higher disease severity in males.",

The strengths of this work are instead the gender medicine perspective and the validated methodology that allowed to collect good-quality evidence for the estimate of effect sizes. Besides, meta-analyses have been considered to be the highest level of evidence [48] . Although it is true that the quality of evidence also depends on the quality of the included studies, our results can be considered reliable, as we limited the meta-analysis to studies of satisfactory quality.",
