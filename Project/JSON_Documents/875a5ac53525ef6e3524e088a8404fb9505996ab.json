Here, we distilled over 3,000,000 data points from 18 publically archived CoV infection transcriptomic datasets into consensus regulatory 19 signatures, or consensomes, that rank genes based on their transcriptional 20 responsiveness to infection of human cells by MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 21 subtypes. We computed overlap between genes with elevated rankings in the CoV 22 consensomes against those from transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq consensomes for nearly 23 880 cellular signaling pathway nodes. Validating the CoV infection consensomes, we 24 identified robust overlap between their highly ranked genes and high confidence targets 25 of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. We then developed a 26 series of use cases that illustrate the utility of the CoV consensomes for hypothesis 27 generation around mechanistic aspects of the cellular response to CoV infection. We 28 make the CoV infection datasets and their universe of underlying data points freely 29 accessible through the Signaling Pathways Project web knowledgebase at 30 https://www.signalingpathways.org/datasets/index.jsf. : bioRxiv preprint Josset et al., 2013; Sims et al., 2013; Yoshikawa et al., 2010). To date however the field 56 has lacked a resource that fully capitalizes on these datasets by, firstly, using them to 57 rank human genes according to their transcriptional response to CoV infection and 58 secondly, contextualizing these transcriptional responses by integrating them with 59 'omics data points relevant to host cellular signaling pathways. Here, as a service to the 60 research community to catalyze the development of novel CoV therapeutics, we 61 generated consensomes for infection of human cells by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 62 CoVs. We then analyzed the extent to which high confidence transcriptional targets for 63 these viruses intersected with genes with elevated rankings in transcriptomic and ChIP-64 Seq consensomes for cellular signaling pathway nodes. Integration of the CoV 65 consensomes with the existing universes of SPP transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data 66 points in a series of use cases illuminates previously uncharacterized intersections 67 between CoV infection and human cellular signaling pathways. The CoV infection 68 consensome and its underlying datasets provide researchers with a unique and freely 69 accessible framework within which to generate and pressure test hypotheses around 70 human cellular signaling pathways impacted by CoV infection. : bioRxiv preprint 93 transcription factor (Supplementary information, Section 2, columns W-Z).

We recently 39 described the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP; (Ochsner et al., 2019), an integrated 40 'omics knowledgebase designed to assist bench researchers in leveraging publically 41 archived transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq datasets to generate research hypotheses. A 42 unique aspect of SPP is its collection of consensus regulatory signatures, or 43 consensomes, which rank genes based on the frequency of their significant differential 44 expression across transcriptomic experiments mapped to a specific signaling pathway 45 node or node family. By surveying across multiple independent datasets, we have 46 shown that consensomes recapitulate pathway node-genomic target regulatory 47 relationships to a high confidence level (Ochsner et al., 2019). 48 Placing the transcriptional events associated with human CoV infection in context with 49 those associated with other signaling paradigms has the potential to catalyze the 50 development of novel therapeutic approaches. The CoV research community has been 51 active in generating and archiving transcriptomic datasets documenting the 52 transcriptional response of human cells to infection by the three major CoV species, 53 namely, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) and severe acute 54 respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 (SARS1) and 2 (SARS2) (DeDiego et al., 2011; 55 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "CoVs.

Another gene of note in 234 this group is INHBA, encoding activin A, overexpression of which in murine lung gives 235 rise to a phenotype resembling acute respiratory distress-like syndrome (Apostolou et 236 al., 2012), a condition commonly associated with CoV infection (Totura & Bavari, 2019). 237 Other genes in the group provide evidence for the potential mechanisms of infection 238 and propagation of CoVs. TJAP1, for example, encodes a member of a family of 239 proteins involved in regulation of tight junctions, shown to be route of porcine epidemic 240 diarrhea coronavirus entry into epithelial cells (Luo et al., 2017). In addition, GON7 is a 241 member of the KEOPS complex (Wan et al., 2017), which is involved in 242 threonylcarbamoylation of tRNAs, which represent an important host facet of the 243 retroviral life cycle (Jin & Musier-Forsyth, 2019). Interestingly, another critical gene in 244 this tRNA pathway, YRDC, is the 19 th ranked gene in the ALL CoV consensome 245 (Supplementary information Section 2). 246 247 Use case 3: evidence for antagonism between progesterone receptor and 248 interferon receptor signaling in the airway epithelium 249 Although a lack of clinical data has so far prevented a definitive evaluation of the 250 connection between pregnancy and susceptibility to SARS2 infection in COVID-19, 251 pregnancy has been previously associated with the incidence of viral infectious 252 diseases, particularly respiratory infections (Sappenfield et al., 2013; Siston et al., 253 2010). We were interested therefore to see consistent overlap between the 254 progesterone receptor (PGR) TC95 and all the viral TC95s, with the enrichment being the crosstalk implied by this overlap in the context of the airway epithelium, we 257 first identified a set of 16 genes that were in both the ALL CoV and PGR TC95s. We 258 then retrieved two SPP experiments involving treatment of A549 airway epithelial cells 259 with the PGR full antagonist RU486 (RU), alone or in combination with the GR agonist 260 dexamethasone (DEX). As shown in Figure 6 , there was nearly unanimous correlation 261 in the direction of regulation of all 16 genes in response to CoV infection and PGR loss 262 of function. These data indicate that antagonism between PGR and IFNR signaling in 263 the airway epithelium may predispose pregnant women to infection by SARS2. 264 265 Use case 4: evidence for a role for the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT in the 266 interferon response to viral infection 267 Although telomerase activation has been well characterized in the context of cell 268 immortalization by human tumor virus infection (Gewin et al., 2004; Klingelhutz et al., 269 1996; Yang et al., 2004), no connection has previously been made between CoV or IAV 270 infection and telomerase. We were therefore intrigued to observe robust overlap 271 between all viral TC95s and that of the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT. In support of 272 this finding, NFkB signaling has been shown to induce expression (Yin et al., 2000) and 273 nuclear translocation (Akiyama et al., 2003) of TERT, and direct co-regulation by 274 telomerase of NFkB-dependent transcription has been linked to chronic inflammation 275 (Ghosh et al., 2012). Inspecting the ALL CoV consensome underlying data points (data 276 not shown) we found that the TERT gene was not transcriptionally induced in response 277 to infection by any of the CoVs, indicating that the overlap between its TC95 and those CoVs might occur in response to an upstream regulatory signal. If functional 279 interactions between TERT and inflammatory nodes did indeed take place in response 280 to CoV infection, we anticipated that this would be reflected in close agreement 281 regarding the direction of differential expression of CoV infection-regulated genes in 282 response to perturbation of TERT on the one hand, and on the other, to stimulation of 283 the classic viral response IFNRs. To test this hypothesis, we took the same set of 20 284 ISGs referred to previously (Fig. 1) and compared their direction of regulation across all 285 experiments underlying the ALL CoV, TERT and IFNR consensomes. For reference, the 286 TERT consensome (Section 13) and its underlying data points (Section 14) are 287 provided in the Supplementary information. With respect to the IFNR and TERT data 288 points, we observed a nearly universal alignment in the direction of regulation of all 289 genes tested with those in the CoV infection experiments (Fig. 6), with agreement in the 290 direction of regulation across 99% of the underlying probesets. We should note that of 291 the 1859 p < 0.05 CoV infection ISG data points, we observed repression, rather than 292 induction, in response to CoV infection in 303 (~15%) , which may be attributable to the 293 impact of differences in cell type, cell cycle stage or virus incubation time across the 294 independent experiments. Our results are consistent with a model in which activation of 295 telomerase is a component of the human innate immune response to viral infection.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF13": {"text": "5: SARS2 infection of human cells is specifically associated with an298 epithelial to mesenchymal transition transcriptional signature 299 Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which epithelial cells lose 300 their polarity and adhesive properties and acquire the migratory and invasive Adair & Ledermann, 2020; P.

Moreover, EMT is widely 305 accepted as a core component of the process by which renal tubular cells transform into 306 mesenchymal cells during the development of fibrosis in kidney disease (Y. Liu, 2006), 307 a signature comorbidity of SARS2 infection (Durvasula et al., 2020). Of the 834 CC95s 308 analyzed, overlap (p < 0.05) was specific to the SARS2 CC95 for only five; SNAI2/Slug, 309 SOX2, GATA6, CTBP1 and PRMT1. Strikingly, a literature search indicated that these 310 five nodes were connected by documented roles in in the promotion of EMT (Avasarala 311 et al., 2015; Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2013; Martinelli et al., 2017; Nieto, 2002; Sahu 312 et al., 2017). In addition to these nodes, whose C95 genes were exclusively enriched (p 313 < 0.05) in the SARS2 C95 genes, we identified several other EMT-linked nodes whose 314 CC95 genes were preferentially enriched (p < 0.05) in the SARS2 TC95 genes (Figs. 3-315 5), including the homeodomain transcription factor SIX2 (C.-A. Wang et al., 2014), 316 SMAD4 (Siraj et al., 2019), and the co-nodes PYGO2 (Chi et al., 2019), SKI (Tecalco-317 Cruz et al., 2018), BRD7 (T. Liu et al., 2017) and STAG2 (Nie et al., 2019). 318 To investigate this further, we computed overlap between the individual viral TC99s and 319 a list of 335 genes manually curated from the research literature as signature EMT 320 markers (Supplementary information Section 15; Zhao et al., 2015). Consistent with the 321 node consensome enrichment analysis, we observed significant enrichment of 322 members of this gene set within the SARS2 CC99, but not those of the ALL CoV, 323 SARS1, MERS or IAV consensomes (Supplementary information Section 16). therefore, we next calculated airway epithelial cell-specific consensomes for 328 SARS1 and MERS and computed overlap of their TC95s against the 864 pathway 329 node/node family CC95s & TC95s.

Although some EMT 339 genes, such as CXCL2 and IRF9, had elevated rankings across all four consensomes, 340 the collective EMT gene signature had a significantly higher mean percentile value in 341 the SARS2 consensome than in each of the three others(Fig. 9).342 Although EMT has been associated with infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus 343 (Xia et al., 2017), this is to our knowledge the first evidence connecting CoV infection, 344 and specifically SARS2 infection, to EMT. Interestingly, several members of the group 345 of SARS2-induced EMT genes have been associated with signature pulmonary 346 comorbidities of CoV infection, including ADAR (Diaz-Pina et al., 2018)Vukmirovic et al., 2017) and SOD2 (Gao et al., 2008). Of note in the context of these 348 data is the fact that signaling through two SARS2 cellular receptors, ACE2/AT2 and 349 CD147/basigin, has been linked to EMT in the context of organ fibrosis (Kato et al., 350 2011; Ruster & Wolf, 2011; C. Wang et al., 2018). Moreover, overlap between of the 351 CoV TC95s and the TERT CC95 was particularly robust in the case of SARS2, a finding 352 of potential relevance to the fact that telomerase has been implicated in EMT (Z. Liu et 353 al., 2013). Collectively, our data indicate that EMT warrants further investigation as a 354 SARS2-specific pathological mechanism. 355 Development of a CoV infection cell signaling knowledgebase 356 Having validated the ALL CoV consensome, we next wished to make it freely available 357 to the research community for re-use in the characterization of signaling events 358 associated with CoV infection. Firstly, the viral infection datasets were curated 359 accordingly to our previously described protocol (Ochsner et al., 2019) made available 360 for browsing in the SPP Dataset listing 361 (https://www.signalingpathways.org/datasets/index.jsf). As with other SPP datasets, and 362 per FAIR data best practice, CoV infection datasets were associated with detailed 363 descriptions, assigned a digital object identifier, and linked to the associated article to 364 place the dataset in its original experimental context. Loading the CoV datasets into the 365 SPP also automatically made the underlying data points discoverable by the SPP query 366 tool Ominer (Ochsner et al., 2019). These reports represent a summary of the current 367 state of transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq knowledge on the regulatory relationship of a 368 given gene with upstream regulatory pathway nodes, or in clinical and model 369 experiments. The full value of the integration of the CoV consensome with the existing can perhaps be best appreciated in the context of the one click links to 371 Ominer Regulation Reports from the individual CoV datasets. These Reports provide 372 researchers with a wealth of contextual data on signaling pathways impacted by CoV 373 infection in the context of a specific gene. Table 2 shows links to Regulation Reports for 374 the top twenty ranked genes in the ALL CoV consensome.

Moreover, the substantial 384 logistical obstacles to BSL3 certification only emphasizes the need for fullest possible 385 access to, and re-usability of, existing CoV infection datasets to focus and refine 386 hypotheses prior to carrying out in vivo CoV infection experiments. To this end, we 387 generated a set of CoV infection consensomes that rank human genes by the 388 reproducibility of their significant differential expression in response to infection of 389 human cells by CoVs. We then computed the CoV consensomes against high 390 confidence transcriptional signatures for a broad range of cellular signaling pathway 391 nodes, affording investigators with a broad range of signaling interests an entrez into 392 the study of CoV infection of human cells.

Not unexpectedly -and speaking again to validation of the consensomes -the strongest and most significant CoV TC95 overlaps were observed for CC95s for known transcription factor mediators of the transcriptional response to CoV infection, including members of the NF\u03baB (Ludwig & Planz, 2008; Poppe et al., 2017; Ruckle et al., 2012), IRF (Chiang & Liu, 2018) and STAT (Blaszczyk et al., 2016; Frieman et al., 2007; Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998) transcription factor families. Consistent with its known role in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (Hasan et al., 2013), we also observed appreciable overlap between the CC95 for TFEB and the ALL CoV TC95. Moreover, the strong overlap between the GTF2B/TFIIB CC95 and all viral TC95s reflects previous evidence identifying GTF2B as a target for orthomyxovirus 153 (Haas et al., 2018), herpes simplex virus (Gelev et al., 2014) and hepatitis B virus", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted May 14, 2020.. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059527 doi: bioRxiv preprint Chen, Y., Shen, X.-R., Wang, X., Y Shi, Z.-L.
