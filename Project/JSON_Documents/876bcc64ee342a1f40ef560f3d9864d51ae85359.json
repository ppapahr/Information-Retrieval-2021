The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of postgraduate dental learners and instructors about the transition to distance learning, including the changes to the learning and teaching and its efficaciousness. A convergent mixed methods approach to research was utilized. All the instructors and postgraduate learners in a dental college were invited to participate in an online survey. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses on SPSS for Windows version 25.0, and for the responses to the open-ended questions, multi-staged thematic analysis was utilized. Both groups of stakeholders: learners and instructors, were satisfied with the rapid transition to distance learning due to COVID-19. Instructors were significantly more satisfied than the learners. The stakeholders adapted well to the change. The perception of the stakeholders regarding the casebased scenarios significantly influenced their level of satisfaction. As perceived by the stakeholders, the transition to distance learning entailed advantages and challenges. Going through the experience enabled the stakeholders to develop informed opinions of how best to sustain learning and teaching irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic. In conclusion, the worldwide dental education community faced unprecedented challenges due to the onset of COVID-19. From a macro perspective, decision-makers must not miss out on the valuable opportunities, inherent in the experience, to reinforce curriculums, and maximize learning and teaching.",

HBMCDM continued all didactic educational activities as scheduled. At the time of transition, the first-year learners were preparing their research protocols, and the third-year learners were mainly engaged in the preparation of the graduate dissertation. Both of those groups of learners were able to pursue their research work. Some of the second-year learners, had to stop the empirical (i.e., data collection) part of their studies given the implemented COVID-19 directives. Thesis Advisory Committees held discussions and advising sessions related to the different stages of the scientific research method of the dissertations (ranging from research conceptualization to determining of research methodology, and data collection tools and analyses, all the way to preparing of the manuscript) with the learners via Microsoft Teams.",

The College maintained the use of the LMS throughout the distance learning. The heavy reliance on Microsoft Teams was novel. It constituted the main platform which provided a medium for real-time class presentations by both learners and instructors, and for research dissertation-related interactions and clinical CBD.

This study was characterized by four sequential phases: data collection, data analysis, information integration, and knowledge generation. In the first phase, the qualitative and quantitative data were concurrently collected (from both groups of stakeholders: instructors and learners). The second phase of this study it involved analyzing the quantitative datasets independently from the qualitative datasets. Following that, we integrated the generated information, comparing and relating findings from the independent analyses. The information integration, which is expected to raise the validity of the study's findings, was in terms of sources (i.e., learners and instructors) and types (i.e., qualitative and quantitative), and relied on joint model analysis [16, 17] . The interpretation of the integrated information led to the generation of knowledge, which constituted the last phase of the research design.",

These surveys were thoroughly reflected upon, and in turn, extracted segments from all got contextualized and in turn adapted for this study. The survey was composed of three segments. The first segment is composed of 8 components, as per Table 1 , measured against a Likert-type scale of five points (1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neutral, 4: Agree, and 5: Strongly Agree).

Others mentioned resorting to flipped learning approaches which entailed making use of Questions and Answers, discussions, quizzes (i.e., formative assessments to ensure timely attainment of the intended learning outcomes of the sessions), and providing feedback throughout the online sessions. The learners, in turn, deployed more self-directed learning, which is desired in fostering life-long learning. Collaborative learning increased. The instructors assigned more group activities, and the learners became more likely to support each other, The first iteration shows how secondary color Green emerged by mixing the primary color Blue with the primary color Yellow (which constitutes an analogy of the lateral and critical thinking that took place, and the meta inferences that were generated). In the second iteration, each quadrilateral represents an area of findings. The Blue area was identified from the quantitative analysis.

To make up for the distance and to make good use of the space that this period has created, the dental educators became more engaged via virtual webinars and online conferences. Those opportunities were open and easily accessible to all members of the community-at-large, where knowledge and resource sharing among the stakeholders expanded in scale and scope. A network of dental education institutions was formed, which nurtured international collaborations. Bridging between educational institutions and clinical practitioners was also evident. This interconnected learning community is expected to support postgraduate learners in their future job search and academic collaborations. It also encourages the learners and instructors to develop novel, innovative pedagogical techniques by assimilating materials that are readily available online (e.g., case-scenario banks or educational procedural videos), based upon the constructivist theoretical underpinnings (via strategies such as: inculcation and integration). Along the same lines, among the vast array of resources that learners get access to, are videos of procedures that enable clinicians to practice the associated set of skills prior to implementing it for a patient, all of which are desired in any curriculum but seldom occurs [40, 41] .",

This limitation is further pronounced given the exceptionality of the times of the COVID-19 pandemic (on all fronts). Both groups of stakeholders faced significant changes in their personal and social lives. Their day-to-day life was majorly disrupted, and they were all under a lot of pressure due to the halting of the clinical training which, in principle, entails 60% of the postgraduates' time. This left the stakeholders with more time to study and to engage in other virtual educational activities which might not remain the case after resuming the clinical learning. Therefore, any decision on the changes in the curriculum towards blended learning needs to be tailored in accordance with the reality of post-pandemic circumstances. In addition, this study evaluated the official platforms of learning. It was evident, though, that unofficial learning tools such as Social Media Applications (SMA) were of added value to the learning and teaching. Correctly understanding how such learning tools can be maximized is essential when planning for distance learning.",

Moreover, it would be useful to develop a contextualized competency-based model that would constitute the foundation for instructors' professional development. It would be interesting for the College to adapt action research to develop, with the thorough engagement of the stakeholders, contingency learning, and teaching plans for crises. Additionally, one of the most significant changes identified with this rapid change centered on assessment. This is an area for which further exploration would help understand the broader impact of the switch to online instruction. Another component demanding further investigation is the loss of hands-on experience for clinical students. Increased attention and analysis related to outcomes is merited given the discipline's core requirement of developed hand and chairside communications skills.",
