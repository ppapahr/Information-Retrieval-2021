[2] [3] [4] In this retrospective population-based study, we compared data on abuse of children and adolescents aged 0-17 years during the first half of 2019 and 2020 in Sergipe state, Northeast Brazil, which is recognised as the poorest region in the country. Information on child abuse was extracted from the official child maltreatment database of the Coordination of Statistics and Criminal Analysis of the Sergipe state. Our outcome of interest was nonaccidental physical injury inflicted on a child by his or her parents or other person legally responsible for the child's care. Data also included gender, age and race/ethnicity and all cases were de-identified. Results were expressed in absolute and relative frequencies. Two-proportion Z-test was used to compare occurrences of child abuse between 2019 and 2020 according to children's characteristics. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
