In my address, I expressed the belief that 'we need to be compassionate and non-violent; to be focused upon the biological bottom-line.' I suggested that Hangzhou become a global biodiversity corridor, in keeping with her traditional Garden of Eden ethos; a greenbelt like that surrounding Kyoto, teeming with gardens and wildlife; or like Devonport, New Zealand-the first nuclear-free zone in the world; or Denmark's Sams\u00f8, a nearly carbon-neutral island; organic Mendocino, organic wine and olive regions in Spain-Andalusia and La Mancha-or the Haa Valley of Bhutan. A green space like the vast majority of the nation of Suriname, or any Jain monastery across India where Gross National Happiness and a reverence for all living beings reigns supreme.",
