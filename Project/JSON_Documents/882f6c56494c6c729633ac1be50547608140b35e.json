It is not yet clear, however, whether parental burnout varies by culture, and if so, why it might do so. In this study, we examined the prevalence of parental burnout in 42 countries (17,409 parents; 71% mothers; M age = 39.20) and showed that the prevalence of parental burnout varies dramatically across countries. Analyses of cultural values revealed that individualistic cultures, in particular, displayed a noticeably higher prevalence and mean level of parental burnout. Indeed, individualism plays a larger role in parental burnout than either economic inequalities across countries, or any other individual and family characteristic examined so far, including the number and age of children and the number of hours spent with them. These results suggest that cultural values in Western countries may put parents under heightened levels of stress.",

However, several major sociological changes over the past few decades (including, but not limited to, the International Child Convention, 1989 , and increased state regulation; Daly, 2007) have profoundly changed parenting, leading to increased parental involvement, more intensive parenting, and child overprotection and optimization (Bristow, 2014; Craig et al., 2014) . It is in this zeitgeist that the notion of parental burnout has emerged-a condition characterized by intense exhaustion related to parenting, emotional distancing from one's children, a loss of pleasure and efficacy in one's parental role, and a contrast between previous and current parental self (Mikolajczak et al., 2019) .",

As regards the parents themselves, parental burnout can give rise to suicidal and escape ideations (Mikolajczak et al., 2019) , which are much more frequent in parental burnout than in job burnout or even depression . This finding is not surprising considering that one cannot resign from one's parenting role or be put on sick leave from one's children. In addition to increasing the desire to physically escape from the parenting situation, parental burnout is also related to psychological forms of escape such as alcohol use . At the biological level, parental burnout causes a dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Brianda et al., 2020b) , which is most likely causally involved in the somatic complaints and sleep disorders reported by burned out parents (Sarrionandia-Pena, 2019) and potentially also in the increase in child-directed violence (Martorell & Bugental, 2006; Moons et al., 2010) . Indeed, in addition to affecting the parents themselves, parental burnout has serious repercussions on children by leading previously good parents (Chen et al., 2019) to become neglectful or even violent towards their offspring . All these effects are causal because when parental burnout is treated via a targeted psychological intervention, suicidal and escape ideations and parental violence and neglect decrease proportionally to the decrease in parental burnout, and HPA axis activity normalizes .",

Lifelong prevalence data are not available, but studies conducted in European and Anglo-Saxon countries (Belgium, France, England, and USA) have shown that an alarming number of parents have parental burnout. Conservative point prevalence estimates suggest that at least 5% of parents have burnout. However, in the absence of cross-cultural studies including non-Western countries, it is unclear whether this pattern is also evident in the rest of the world. Given that parenting norms and practices dramatically vary across cultures (Bornstein, 2013) , it seems plausible that the prevalence of parental burnout would also vary substantially across the globe.",

Yet, this variation in prevalence is admittedly difficult to interpret due to variation in the instruments used to measure parental burnout, the varying cutoff scores adopted, and the different target populations (e.g., community samples versus parents with severely ill children). It therefore remains unclear (i) whether the prevalence of parental burnout varies across the globe and, if so, (ii) whether culture helps to explain these differences in parental burnout. Based on the literature, we expected that the prevalence of parental burnout would vary across countries and that culture would help to explain this variation.",

To answer the question (i), we examined the prevalence and the mean level of parental burnout in each country. To address the question (ii), we tested the association between parental burnout and Hofstede's six cultural values (Hofstede, 2001;  i.e., Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Indulgence) as the most widely used indicators of cross-cultural differences (Bleidorn et al., 2016; Taras et al., 2010) . Given that the parents came from culturally, economically, and geographically diverse settings, we controlled for a large set of sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, educational level, number of biological children and children in the household, age of the youngest and the oldest child, hours spent with children per day, number of women and men living in the household and caring for the children on a daily basis, working status, years spent in the country, ethnicity, family types, and neighborhood profile).",

The IIPB Consortium was set up by the first and last authors of the study (I.R. and M.M.) in 2017. The authors aimed to include in the consortium as many countries as possible that differed from each other in terms of their geographical position, cultural values, and socioeconomic level. Thus, in a first step, based on the foregoing criteria, the authors contacted a number of collaborators to invite them to participate in the project. Twenty-two countries, including Belgium as the coordinating country, joined the consortium through this process (Australia, Brazil, Cameroun, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, France, Italy, Lebanon, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Togo, UK, USA, and Vietnam). In a second step, the first author contacted well-known experts in parenting in order to supplement this initial pool and to increase the diversity of cultural values. Eight more countries were recruited through this process (Algeria, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Sweden). In the last step, to further extend the number of countries included in the study, when an author from a non-participating country wrote to I.R. or M.M. to inquire about parental burnout (e.g., about the Parental Burnout Assessment-PBA; Roskam et al., 2018) , they invited him/her to join the consortium. Twenty more countries were invited to join the consortium through that means (Argentina, Austria, Burundi, Colombia, Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Uruguay). Countries that expressed interest received a \"Call for participation\" explaining the background and aims of the study, the larger goals of the IIPB Consortium, the commitments of the IIPB members and coordinators, and the deadlines that would need to be met for translating the instrument, obtaining ethical approval, and collecting the data. Then, countries that confirmed their wish to join the consortium (i.e., 46 countries out of the 50 countries who received the call; Congo, Israel, To control for overrepresentation of mothers in the survey, prevalence rates were reassessed weighting for sex frequencies in each country More information about the data collection procedure in each country is available upon request to the first author. 2",

This protocol included the informed consent, demographic questions, and a few questionnaires (see the \"Measures\" section below) measuring the variables of interest in this study. Countries were free to add other measures at the end of the study protocol if they wish. In the end, 42 countries out of the 46 completed the data collection. Researchers from Greece, Mexico, Morocco, and South Korea withdrew from the consortium due to unforeseen personal or professional circumstances. Non-English speaking or non-French speaking countries first translated (and back-translated) the study protocol. The \"Call for participation\" recommended following the WHO standards for the process of translation and adaptation of instruments (http:// www.who.int/substance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/). Translation and back-translations were made once for each of the 21 different languages, (i.e., Arabic, Basque, Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkey, Urdu, and Vietnamese). All countries submitted the study to the local Ethics committee for approval except where ethics approval was not mandatory (see Table 2 ) and started the recruitment once the study was approved. As shown in Table 2 , the recruitment mode varied according to local practices: the study was completed online in 19 countries, mostly online in 7 countries, exclusively on paper and pencil in 11 countries, mostly on paper and pencil in 2 countries, and a mix of both in 3 countries. The majority of the countries in which the study was conducted fully online included three attentional check questions to enable researchers to identify people who did not respond seriously to the study. These questions were randomly inserted in the survey and the instruction had the same length as the other items. They required participants to select, for instance, \"every day\" for that particular question. Participants who failed to select the right answer to the three attentional check questions were removed.",

While reporting sex, age, or number of years in the country seemed very simple, asking about household/family composition, occupational status, or ethnicity in a cross-cultural study involving very diverse countries was much more difficult. In order to formulate the best items, we used a twofold strategy. First, we discussed with several consortium members to approve this specific part of the IIPB protocol to ensure that the questions captured the sociodemographic characteristics of respondents in a way that was valid in all countries. For example, working status The total frequency may be lower than 100% when some participants in the country checked \"other\" as family type was assessed by the notion of \"paid professional activity,\" because the meaning of \"work\" (i.e., what is considered a professional activity) varies considerably across cultures. Since we wanted to focus on work as a source of financial support for the family (i.e., the breadwinner function), we referred to the notion of \"paid work activity\" rather than simply \"work.\" Next, we consulted the literature. For example, the way we measured ethnicity drew on previous research, particularly that of Jacobs et al. (2009) . Beyond demographic measures, the common protocol included several measures designed to address different research questions and goals (e.g., comparing the prevalence of parental burnout across countries; investigating the relations between parental burnout and perceived ideal parental selfdiscrepancies; examining the contribution of different parental duties to parental burnout). Because these questions are too diverse to be addressed in the same article, we describe below only the measures used in the current article.

Skewness and kurtosis values indicated that several items displayed deviations from normality. Conceptually, these deviations from normality make sense: like most mental health indicators, burnout is expected to present an asymmetric distribution (i.e., to be positively skewed). The estimation method used was diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) with asymptotic covariance and polychoric correlation matrices. We then tested the factorial invariance (including metric and scalar invariance) of the PBA across sex and languages. We used several goodness-of-fit indices to determine the acceptability of the models: Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square statistics (S-B\u03c7 2 ; Satorra & Bentler, 1994) , the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI). For CFI and TLI, values close to 0.90 or greater are acceptable to good. RMSEA and SRMR should preferably be less than or equal to 0.08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . For measurement invariance, we implemented a set of nested models with gradually increasing parameters and constraints using a stepwise multiple group confirmatory factor analysis or MG-CFA. In the first step, we tested the parental burnout model for configural invariance as the basic level of measurement invariance. In the second step, we assessed item factor loadings in a metric invariance model. In the third step, we tested scalar invariance with the intercepts set as equal across groups. Finally, we verified the invariance of measurement errors for a model in which all error variances were constrained to be equal across groups. For measurement invariance, we reported change in S-B\u03c7 2 and we applied a criterion of a \u2212 0.01 change in CFI, paired with a change in RMSEA of 0.015 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002; Rutkowski & Svetina, 2014) .",

The second cutoff score was derived from the combination of several parental burnout indicators, based on a preregistered multi-method and multi-informant analysis strategy (i.e., selfreported measures [provided by participants], clinical judgments [completed by external judges based on a 5-min speech provided by participants on their parenting experience], and a biological measure of stress [the analysis of cortisol levels contained in participants' hair]): parents were judged to have parental burnout if their score was equal to or greater 86 (see https://osf.io/ujfb3 for more details about the analysis strategy).

The value was obtained by dividing the sex proportion in the general population (i.e., the sex distribution in the population is 50% females) by the sex distribution in each sample (e.g., in the Algerian sample, the sex distribution is 60% mothers). Thus, the weight value of 0.50/0.60 = 0.83 was obtained for Algerian mothers and the corresponding weight obtained for fathers was 0.50/0.40 = 1.25.

In step 1 (conditional model 1), we controlled for sociodemographic variables (age, sex, educational level, and type of neighborhood [disadvantaged, average, prosperous] , working status [having or not a paid professional activity]; all of these being measured at the individual level). In step 2 (conditional model 2), we introduced variables influencing parental workload (number of children, family type [single parent, two parents, multigenerational], age of the youngest child, number of women taking care of the children on a daily basis, number of men taking care of the children on a daily basis, average number of hours spent with the child[ren] on a daily basis; all these variables being measured at the individual level). In step 3 (conditional model 3), we included the growth national product (GNP; database, 2019) and the six cultural values (i.e., Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Indulgence), all of these being obtained at the country level. The multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses take into account that many covariates vary both within and between countries. Thus, the effect of all sociodemographic characteristics that we entered in the two first steps was controlled for when we introduced cultural values in the third model.",

            "text": "The analyses first revealed that the measure of parental burnout used in this research (i.e., the Parental Burnout Assessment Roskam et al., (2018) has excellent reliability across all 42 countries (all Cronbach's alphas > 0.85; see Table 1 ). Both the original four-factor structure and the second-order factor model fitted the data, not only in the pooled sample, but also in fathers' and mothers' subsamples and in the 21 languages separately (see Table 4 ). Because we used the total score of parental burnout in the current study, we tested measurement invariance of the second-order factor model across both sex and the 21 languages. As shown in Table 5 , adequate model fit indices, \u0394RMSEA, and \u0394CFI indicated the same number and pattern of dimensions across sex and languages. Metric and scalar invariances were supported as well, and measurement errors in item responses were also equivalent across sex and languages. Note. Baseline invariance model tests equivalence form of all the relationships by imposing configural invariance, (i.e., the same indictors loading on the latent variables for each group). Metric model is a model where only the factor loadings are equal across groups but the intercepts are allowed to differ between groups. This is called metric invariance and tests whether respondents across groups attribute the same meaning to the latent construct under study. Scalar model is a model where the loadings and intercepts are constrained to be equal. This is called scalar invariance and implies that the meaning of the construct (the factor loadings), and the levels of the underlying items (intercepts) are equal in both groups. Error model is the most restrictive invariance measurement. This is achieved when both loadings and the error variances are invariant across groups. It is considered as the ideal level This allowed us to examine the mean level and prevalence of parental burnout in each country (cutoff scores: 92 and 86 on a scale from 0 to 138). The resulting prevalence rates corrected for inequities in sample size and sex, respectively, are figured in the penultimate and last column of Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 , the prevalence of parental burnout greatly varies from country to country. This is true even when we control for sample size or sex imbalance (see Table 1 ). These differences between countries are also reflected in the mean level of parental burnout in each country (see Table 1 ). There is a difference of 33 points between the country with the lowest mean level (i.e., Thailand) and the country with the highest mean level of parental burnout (i.e., Poland). The size of the differences in parental burnout between countries suggested that cultural factors might be operative. To investigate whether cultural values are associated with parental burnout, and knowing that there is no cultural indicator specifically related to parenting that would be available for the majority of the countries included in this study, we obtained the position of each country on the six cultural values defined by (Hofstede, 2001;  i.e., Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Indulgence). The correlations between each cultural value and both the prevalence and mean level of parental burnout in each country are displayed in Table 6 . Individualism was the sole value to be significantly associated with both the mean level and prevalence of parental burnout. We represented the association between Individualism and the mean level of parental burnout on the scatter plot depicted in Fig. 2 . As shown in this figure, the higher the individualism of a given country, the higher the mean level of parental burnout in that same country. The effect size is large (d = 1.16) according to Cohen's norms. As also shown in Fig. 2 , the overwhelming majority of individualistic countries are Euro-American countries. Figure 2 Correlation between the level of parental burnout in a country and the position of that country on the level of individualism. Five countries Algeria, Cameroon, Cuba, Rwanda, Togo are not represented in Fig. 2 because the level of individualism in these countries has not been reported by Hofstede Individualistic countries exhibit much higher levels of parental burnout.",

            "text": "The current results have important implications for both science and practice. Regarding science, these findings illustrate the richness and importance of large-scale cross-cultural studies which go beyond the largely \"Western\" samples. This is important in all domains of psychological science, and also in the parenting domain, where 90% of the studies have been conducted on US parents (Arnett, 2008; Bornstein, 2013; Mistry & Dutta, 2015; see Keller et al., 2006; Super & Harkness, 1986 for notable exceptions). Regarding the implications for practice, our findings show the limits of individualism and invite reflection on solutions to counter its adverse effects on parents. The much lower prevalence of parental burnout in collectivistic countries-even when socioeconomic inequalities and other factors are controlled-suggests that strengthening the social network of mutual aid and solidarity around families might well help to decrease the prevalence of parental burnout in individualistic countries. This accords with recent findings obtained in Poland (a rather individualistic country) showing that the availability of social support is a very strong protective factor vis-avis parental burnout (Szczygiel et al., 2020) . This is clearly not the only potential pathway, and further studies are needed to clarify why parents in more individualistic countries are more exposed to parental burnout than those from less individualistic countries. Such research will provide much-needed prevention or treatment avenues that can be tailored to specific individual and cultural contexts.",

However, when prevalence rates were reassessed on samples of approximately 200 randomly selected parents in all samples with more than 299 participants, the resulting prevalence remained essentially unchanged. Second, mothers were overrepresented in the survey in almost all countries. Again, when prevalence rates were reassessed weighting for sex frequencies in each country, the resulting prevalence remained essentially unchanged. Third, although we adjusted for several potential confounding factors, residual confounding by unmeasured factors cannot be ruled out. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that the measure of parental burnout used in this study captures a type of parenting that is more relevant to individualistic cultures than to collectivistic cultures. However, this would not fully explain the correlation found between parental burnout and individualism.",
