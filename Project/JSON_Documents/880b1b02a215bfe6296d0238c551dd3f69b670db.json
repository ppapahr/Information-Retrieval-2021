Mortality rates were 0% vs 9.3% at days 15 and 29 for the active and control groups, respectively (log-rank p=0.056). No significant differences were found in secondary endpoints. At inclusion, patients had a median time of 8 days (IQR, 6-9) of symptoms and 49,4% of them were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma could be superior to standard of care in avoiding progression to mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The strong dependence of results on a limited number of events in the control group prevents drawing firm conclusions about CP efficacy from this trial.

Overall, CP appears to be safe and potentially effective, 1 although formal demonstration of its benefits in well controlled clinical trials is lacking. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the acute need for medical treatments has spread the use of unproven medicines based on the rationale for potential efficacy. Several antiviral agents have been empirically used (i.e lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine), to be subsequently withdrawn when they failed to demonstrate efficacy in randomized clinical trials (RCT). 2, 3 Remdesivir reduces the number of days of disease with no effect on hard outcomes such as progression to severe disease or death. 4 In a large RCT, 5 dexamethasone has shown a benefit in mortality in the subgroup of patients with oxygen support at the time of randomization and at least 7 days from symptoms onset. Regarding CP, a first RCT, prematurely stopped by logistic reasons, did not demonstrate benefit in COVID-19 patients with a median of 30 days of symptoms. However, a positive effect was suggested in the subgroup of non-critical patients. 6 A second trial was also prematurely stopped after a first interim analysis showed that most patients already had high neutralizing antibody titers at the time of inclusion and that no statistical differences in outcomes were seen between treatment groups. 7 The ConPlas-19 RCT was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of CP used to prevent progression to severe disease or death in hospitalized patients with earlier forms of COVID-19.",

The impact of these policies in Europe is hard to assess, as there have been no scientific reports from such observational studies since the EU program of CP in COVID-19 was released on April 4, 2020. Indirect evidence may suggest a negative impact, though. The Recovery trial reports a marginal number of patients randomized to CP despite several thousand being randomized to other therapeutic alternatives. 5 In ConPlas-19, aside from the recent fall in recruitment related to pandemic control, out of 32 hospitals opened in 12 different Regional Health Departments in Spain, only 14 sites recruited any patients throughout the pandemic (supplementary appendix). In the US, an expanded access program has recently reported the first 35,322 COVID-19 patients treated with CP, 12 suggesting apparent signatures of efficacy despite lacking untreated controls, and in a population of patients in which more than half were already in ICU at the time of treatment, which would be at odds with the lack of efficacy in this critically-ill setting in the few RCT available. 6, 7 While RCT in the US and worldwide accrue insufficient numbers, over 73,000 patients have been infused CP through open access in the US (www.uscovidplasma.org), and many more thousands are likely to have been .

If only a small percentage of these patients had been included in RCT, we would know by now whether CP is effective in COVID-19 at all, in which cases, and have robust evidence to make reliable recommendations to benefit future patients. 9 In summary, CP appears to be safe in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who do not require high-flow oxygen devices or mechanical ventilation, and may reduce their probability of clinical deterioration, ICU admission or death. Formal recommendations for efficacy of treatment of COVID-19 patients with CP cannot be concluded from the evidence currently available including this RCT. Despite limitations, the authors decided to close and report the first phase of the trial as a better service to the scientific community. Our results shall be included in an ongoing initiative for pooling data from individual RCT of CP in COVID-19 (http://nyulmc.org/compile). 13 We hope that this evidence will help the scientific community design and actively recruit in new revised RCT of CP in COVID-19 patients, likely in earlier forms of the disease, as the combined results from basic scientific knowledge and available RCT suggest that very severe COVID-19 cases, in particular those already in ICU and who are likely to have already developed neutralizing antibodies, do not benefit from CP.",

The patient's clinical status was recorded using the seven-category ordinal COVID-19 scale: 1, not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2, not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 6, hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO and 7, death. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in categories 5, 6 or 7 at day 15 of the study. Key secondary outcomes were time to improvement of one category on the ordinal scale; mean change in the ordinal scale from baseline to days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 29; proportion of patients in categories 5, 6 or 7 at day 29; mortality at days 15 and 29; duration of hospital stay; number of days alive and free from oxygen support; number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Serial naso/oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected at days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 29, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR assay. Serum samples were tested at the same time points for anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG.",

Complete tables with changes in the ordinal scale, days free from oxygen and ventilatory support are included as supplementary tables. Planned subgroup analyses according to patient baseline characteristics (duration of disease, seroconversion) or titer of neutralizing antibodies in the administered plasma were not performed due to the low sample size.
