In the second step, we employ a non-linear smoothing on the reordered pixels which yields the denoised image. In the following we describe these steps in detail. Step 1 : Fast Patch Reordering. In order to compute a smooth reordering of pixels, we employ a patch-based similarity approach: We first consider a disc-shaped search region B search of radius \u03c1 search around every pixel u i in the 2D image domain. We then compute the L 2 norm d ij between discshaped patches of radius \u03c1 sim , centered around u i and u j , for all j \u2208 B search . This is followed by constructing a set P i of N pixels within B search which have the least distance from u i according to d ij . This set characterises the desired smooth reordering of pixels. In contrast to Ram et al. [4, 5] who solve instances of the NP-hard travelling salesman problem, we compute the reordering using just a simple sort operation. Ideally, when we average noisy versions of the same greyvalue, we should not introduce artefacts. However, we have noisy versions of approximately equal grey values in the set P i . Moreover, the above simple reordering is achieved at the cost of some disordered pixels in P i , that come from areas of dissimilar greyvalues. In the second step of the algorithm, we employ a very robust non-linear smoothing technique, to deal with both problems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 895, "end": 897, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MODELLING OF OUR DENOISING ALGORITHM"}, {"text": "Step 2 : Non-linear Smoothing.
