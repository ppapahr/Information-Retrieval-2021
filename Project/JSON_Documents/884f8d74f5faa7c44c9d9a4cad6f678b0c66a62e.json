Due to stay-at-home orders, schools needed to provide online education and children have been required to use applications and digital platforms. Meanwhile, as they were unable to meet friends in-person, children have connected via text messages and social media more often. When children are using educational platforms that demand interactions through posts and comments and they are more connected with peers online, the opportunity for cyberbullying and other forms of online violence increases. Confinement and disruption of child protective services could cause children who experience violence at home and online to suffer in silence. During the crisis, it is likely more difficult to identify children at risk as many adults who would typically identify signs of abuse and maltreatment (e.g. teachers, childcare workers, coaches, extended family, community members, child and family welfare workers) are no longer in regular contact with children. Therefore, practitioners and institutions that work with children would benefit from analyses of available data that can offer insights into how children's experience of certain forms of violence has changed during the pandemic.",

Twitter is one such source of information. This microblogging and social networking service allows users to post and interact with messages known as tweets, which can have a maximum length of 280 characters. Unlike most social networks that require users to be at least 13 years of age, children of any age can sign up to Twitter. Additionally, the content posted on Twitter is available and visible to all users, without network restrictions. According to Statista, as of July 2020, there were approximately 330 million Twitter users, of whom 8 percent were below the age of 18. The United States, Japan, India, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Turkey have the greatest number of users on Twitter with respectively, 62, 49, 17, 15, 15, and 12 million users. The official website of Twitter notes that policies are in place to address abusive behaviors and regulate age screening for the purpose of filtering advertisements. Abusive behaviors are defined as any attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else's voice. Abusive or harmful content can be reported and users who are found to engage in such content may have their posts censored or accounts suspended, depending on the gravity of the offense.",

It utilizes data collected from Twitter users in 16 countries, as well as information gathered from Reddit in one country. Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to detect cases of abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to domestic violence and child physical abuse during the pandemic. In addition, the paper discusses the implications of using such information to make inferences about the impact of the stay-at-home restrictions on violence against children. Figure 1 shows the process scheme, composed of sequential stages, that was used to assess changes in children's exposure to abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying via conversational social media interactions on Twitter during stay-at-home restrictions. Twitter is chosen for this study as it is one of the most widely used social media platforms in the world and its microblog format permits public conversations between users. Unlike Instagram, Snapchats and Facebook, which rank higher among young users (Chen, 2020) , Twitter does not rely as much on videos and images, as engagement mostly happens through textual posts and reposts.",

            "text": "The first stage of the process entailed the selection of a vast number of textual conversations containing abusive or hateful content, or related to cyberbullying, using a pretrained model on a labelled dataset to detect the tweets with abusive or hateful contents. Abusive language refers to any strongly impolite, rude or hurtful language using profanity, that can show a debasement of someone or something, or convey intense emotion (Founta et al., 2018; Park & Fung, 2017; Papegnies, 2017) . Hateful messages express hatred towards a targeted individual or group, or is intended to be derogatory, to humiliate, or to insult the members of the group, on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender (Davidson et al., 2017) . Cyberbullying can be defined as the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, embarrass, intimidate, or aggressively dominate others, using electronic forms of contact. It typically denotes repeated and hostile behavior exhibited by a group or an individual (Chatzakou et al., 2017) . The conversations were labeled as non-abusive/normal, abusive, hateful, or neutral/uncertain using a Machine Learning algorithm that was trained from a pre-classified dataset. Only tweets containing abusive or hateful language were retained. It is worth mentioning that the classifier found the conversations that contained abusive language among users and did not consider posts in which users discuss their concerns about cyberbullying, potential solutions, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f etc. Users in social media can be individuals posting about their lives, or institutions, such as newspapers, sharing the latest news and articles, etc. Posts containing the word \"cyberbullying\" are likely to be about cyberbullying, but not necessarily have bullying content. Thus, the classifier labels the news articles, academic and institutional studies as normal. This is an important filter as increase in tweets may be due to more conversations about a topic, rather than an increase in experiences of an issue. For instance, between March 2019 and April 2020, we collected tweets containing the keyword 'cyberbullying' from New York City. The weekly citations of 'cyberbullying' increased from an average of 20 to 170 citations around March 2020, when the United States started to implement stay-at-home restrictions (results not shown). This substantial spike indicates that cyberbullying became a trending topic once the stay-at-home restrictions started. However, this does not mean that there were more cases of cyberbullying in New York City, as these citations can include news articles, experts' predictions, institutional analysis, academic papers, parents' concerns, etc. Indeed, the filtering model found that on average, only 30 percent of the tweets contained hateful or abusive language.",

To train the model for abusive message detection, 100,000 tweets published in a study from Founta et al. (2018) were used. Each tweet in that study was classified by a group of five individuals into one the following categories: normal, abusive, spam, and hateful. A majority vote was then used as the final label for each tweet. Among all the tweets, 55 percent were labeled as normal, 26 percent as abusive, 14 percent as spam, and 5 percent as hateful. After training and tuning, the model was applied to our dataset, and tweets were classified into one of the four categories listed above.

However, the overall increase in Twitter usage after the stay-at-home restrictions started has been 24 percent (The Washington Post, 2020), which is much smaller than the average weekly increase in abusive tweets. Table 4 shows commonly used ngram (i.e. a sequence of n items from a given text) that were extracted from the abusive or hateful tweets posted in the reference period. It is worth noting that some of the expressions that appeared after the stay-at-home restrictions started, such as those shown in bold in the table, seem to defend cyberbullying or even show pride in the action. <Table 4 about here>-Ngrams extracted from abusive tweets before and after the stay-at-home restrictions started Figure 3 presents the change in abusive and non-abusive tweets between November-December 2019 and March-April 2020 for the additional 15 countries. The number of abusive messages increased in all the countries, but Sweden. The growth was particularly significant in Indonesia, the Philippines, Portugal, and Brazil with a more than 30 percent increase compared to 2019.",

The growth in testimonials related to abuse was higher than the growth in posts about other sensitive topics, including mental health. These findings should be considered in light of other research and studies which have found that COVID-19 restriction measures have inhibited the reporting of child maltreatment to authorities and professionals, such as teachers, who are typically in regular contact with children (see for example: Baron, Goldstein, & Wallace, 2020) . This might suggest that, given the increased online presence of both children and adults, service providers should explore innovative ways through which social media and virtual platforms might be used to identify potential victims of violence.

The countries were chosen to provide geographical coverage as well as varying levels of human development as rated by the Human Development Index (HDI; United Nations Development Programme, 2019). The HDI is an index (between 0 and 1) that measures key dimensions of human development. The three key dimensions are: life expectancy, access to education, and Gross National Income per capita adjusted for the price level of the country. The Coronavirus Government Response Tracker and related Stringency Index (SI) developed by the University of Oxford were also used to account for the severity of the containment measures in place across countries, which was then compared with the ratio of abusive posts. SI is an index (between 0 and 100) as a representative of 17 indicators of government responses. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid. Five of the indicators (H1-H5) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare. For the purpose of this study, the SI scores of each country were divided by 100 to obtain a value between 0 and 1, and scores were reported as of April 1, 2020. For example, the Philippines, which experienced prolonged and strict lockdowns, had at that point in time an SI of 100, while Sweden, which adopted a much more relaxed approach, had an SI equal to 41.To measure the possible growth in the number of abusive messages, all the tweets posted from users in a group of 15 different countries during November and December 2019, as well as March and April 2020 were gathered. Over 40 million tweets from users of all ages were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f collected in total. The collected tweets do not reflect all the tweets posted in the selected countries over the observed time period and only includes the tweets posted by verified users and from a location that was publicly listed in the profiles.",
