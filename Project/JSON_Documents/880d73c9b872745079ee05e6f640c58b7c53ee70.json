Contemporary \"big data\" generated by mobile sensors can improve measurement of transient exposures. Exposure information generated by these devices typically only samples the experience of the target cohort, so a case-control framework may be useful. However, for anonymity, the data may not be available by individual, precluding a case-crossover approach. We present a method called at-risk-measure sampling. Its goal is to estimate the denominator of an incidence rate ratio (exposed to unexposed measure of the at-risk experience) given an aggregated summary of the at-risk measure from a cohort. Rather than sampling individuals or locations, the method samples the measure of the at-risk experience. Specifically, the method as presented samples person-distance and person-events summarized by location. It is illustrated with data from a mobile app used to record bicycling. The method extends an established case-control sampling principle: sample the at-risk experience of a cohort study such that the sampled exposure distribution approximates that of the cohort. It is distinct from density sampling in that the sample remains in the form of the at-risk measure, which may be continuous, such as person-time or person-distance. This aspect may be both logistically and statistically efficient if such a sample is already available, for example from big-data sources like aggregated mobile-sensor data.",

For example, people are at risk of pedestrian fatality only while walking. During this at-risk period, exposures of interest, such as the presence of a sidewalk, may also vary. For etiologic inference, the transience of both at-risk status and exposure should be considered. Measures that account for this transience include person-time (e.g., hours walked), persondistance (kilometers walked), or person-events (intersections crossed on foot). We refer to these, collectively, as measures of the at-risk experience or at-risk measures.",

[3] [4] [5] Such exposures might include transportation infrastructure, 6 air pollution, 3, 7, 8 liquor stores, 9 or areas of malaria risk. 10 In principle, researchers could request that individuals download and share their location history, which is passively tracked by common smartphones. 11, 12 However, recruiting willing individuals may be impractical. 13 To avoid individual recruitment, researchers might use existing sources of anonymized mobile-sensor-generated data with activity summarized by location rather than by person. Strava, for example, aggregates its users' bicycling data by street segment. 7, 14, 15 Using this information, the total bicyclekilometers ridden in an area could then be calculated.",

Regardless of the at-risk measure used or the level at which it is summarized, a density sample is tabulated as a discrete frequency. 22 In this article, we argue that if a sample of an at-risk measure is available (e.g., person-distance traveled while cohort members used an app), then applying density sampling to that sample could result in a loss of information.

If a crash occurred at an intersection between exposure types (n = 46; e.g., a primary road intersecting a residential road), we classified the case as occurring on the road from which the bicyclist entered the intersection, as described on the police report. We assume that the cases, bicycle crashes reported specifically by police, are accurately classified and are not under-reported. 40 The study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB00105514).

Previous research from Atlanta reported that cyclists who used Strava tended to be more confident cyclists, 30 which may mean that they are more likely than non-app users to ride on nonresidential roadways, possibly inducing selection bias. To implement IPSW, with permission of the City of Atlanta, 42 we gathered internal validation data from nine stationary counters (manufacturer: Eco-Counter Urban ZELT) that monitor bicycle traffic in real time with high accuracy 37,43 located at fixed locations throughout the study area. Data from the nine counters were available, on average, in 17.3 of the 23 study months. We calculated the sampling fraction in the 156 segment-month observations. We then fit an events-trials logistic regression model in those observations to estimate the sampling fraction when and where it was unknown (n, segment-month observations = 466,192). Independent variables and model performance are described in eAppendix 4; http:// links.lww.com/EDE/B732. To avoid extreme and implausible values, we truncated 38 the estimated sampling fraction at 0.02 0.5. The total person-distance in each exposure category was then estimated, first summing over month, by equation 6. The resulting estimated exposed-to-unexposed ratio of persondistance was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.9; Table 2 ), suggesting, conditional on the validity of the IPSW model, that the unadjusted exposure ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.9) was a slight overestimate and the condition, equation 3, was narrowly violated. Contrary to our hypothesis above, the model suggests Stravarecorded rides were relatively more likely to have occurred on Bicycle distance (km): residential roads residential (unexposed) roadways. To estimate uncertainty, we resampled residuals from the sampling-fraction model in each bootstrapped replicate, so the 95% CI reflects uncertainty from both the sampling and the parametric model.",

It is distinct from those approaches in that it explicitly accommodates an aggregated summary of the at-risk experience. The example study above might have used a case-crossover, 52 but doing so would have required measurement of exposure in a referent period for each case, information we did not have. The presented method provides another option for estimating epidemiologic measures of association using existing aggregated mobile-sensor data. 14, 25, 26 Other methods have considered settings combining individual-level information about cases with area-level or ecological summaries of the source population at risk. [53] [54] [55] [56] While similar, the proposed method differs from these approaches in that we assume a sample of the at-risk measure is available in each stratum of the exposure. Although particulars vary, the referenced works have considered the situation wherein only an area-level summary of exposure is available, and withinarea variation is not directly accessible. [53] [54] [55] [56] Unmatched incidence density sampling can also be used with data summarized by location. 6, 19 Modifying the definition on p. 124 21 to consider locations, under unmatched locationbased density-sampling, segments are sampled with replacement with probability proportional to the person-distance at risk occurring on them and then, if exposure varies spatially within the sampled segment, a point along each sampled segment is sampled in a second stage to measure exposure. The study by Aldred and colleagues 6 illustrates this approach. In the proposed approach, rather than sampling places with replacement with probability proportional to their at-risk measure, the aggregated at-risk measure is sampled without replacement directly.",

Second, the proposed approach is conceptually appealing in that it reinforces the notion that a case-control study is a sample of a hypothetical cohort study. 21, 46, 57 When the risk ratio is the target parameter, this concept is clear: people are the at-risk measure, and people are sampled. 48, 58 In contrast, when the IRR is the target parameter, a density sample is expected to be proportional to person-time but is not itself a direct sample of person-time, depending on the definition. 21 If instead the IRR is estimated by sampling person-moments from the study base, 22, 59, 60 this concept is perhaps more explicit. 60 The proposed approach might be viewed as extending person-moment sampling 61 to settings with a sample of aggregated, possibly continuous, at-risk data. Third, the proposed approach may be more statistically precise than density sampling. In our example, bicycle-distance was obtained in a single stage (from our perspective) from Strava, and exposure was measured within that sample. Conceivably, we could have applied density sampling to the first-stage sample by sampling segments with replacement with probability proportional to their sampled person-distance. This additional sampling would have lost statistical efficiency without practical benefit. The total sampling variance would have been at least as large as that of the original sample 61 and would have garnered no new information since exposure was known throughout the initial sample.",

Example questions of interest may be associations between roadway infrastructure and crashes in transportation epidemiology, as illustrated above, or associations between environmental factors and violent assault. 62 As the induction period becomes longer and the exposure less spatially specific, the approach may be less informative. For example, anonymized restaurant check-ins have been used to study foodborne illness. 28, 63 Location-level person-event sampling, as described here, could be used to study the IRR between staph infection and exposure to restaurants of concern, but correct specification of the induction period may be a strong assumption. 64, 65 Selection bias may also be a threat to validity. We illustrated IPSW to adjust for possible selection bias. Our IPSW model was limited in that it was fit in only 156 observations and predicted the sampling fraction for 466,192 observations. Although selection bias is possible, an important result is that consistency can hold despite an association between sampling and the at-risk measure (Figure 1 ). This result is reassuring because people who spend more time at risk may more often sample their activity with a sensor. 29, 30 ",
