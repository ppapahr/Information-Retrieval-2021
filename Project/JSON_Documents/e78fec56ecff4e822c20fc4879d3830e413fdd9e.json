Although the respiratory system is the main target of the virus, SARS-Cov-2 often triggers a systemic immune-mediated response that might result in injury to various organs, such as the kidneys, heart or liver(3, 4). Recent reports indicate that hepatic injury is not uncommon among patients with COVID-19(5-7), and further suggest that abnormal liver tests are associated with increased mortality and should therefore be carefully monitored during hospitalization(8-10). However, the predictive value and the association of abnormal liver tests with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is still controversial(11, 12).",

Second, we had no access to laboratory results prior to hospitalization and could not accurately assess whether the observed abnormal liver tests during hospitalization is entirely new. We partially overcome this pitfall, by showing that the peak in abnormal liver tests is significantly higher than the nadir during hospitalization, suggesting that at least in the majority of patients, the maximal abnormal liver tests values are related to the acute disease and not to an underlying liver problem. Third, the cutoff value of 40IU/L for a definition of elevated GPT, GOT and GGT levels is largely arbitrary and was not adjusted for age, weight and gender. However, these cutoffs were used in previous studies(24), and by and large represent values in the range observed in 95% of the healthy population.
