Nevertheless, the percentage of severe cases and mortality rates were among the lowest worldwide. 6 A nationwide lockdown has been imposed since March and a great deal of dental clinics restricted patient reception to emergency cases after following a strict triage process beforehand. 7 However, a number of patients depended on telephone consultations as a means of medical advice, and in a group of anecdotal cases, we noticed an association between gingival bleeding and inflammation with COVID-19 infections.",
