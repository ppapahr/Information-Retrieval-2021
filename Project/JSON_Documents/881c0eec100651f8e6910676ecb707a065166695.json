            "text": "A main mathematical model used in studying COVID-19 data is the traditional mathematical infectious disease model known as the \"susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R)\" model, or SIR model 1 and its variations, such as stochastic SIR models, for the purpose of determining the total numbered of infected, the reproductive number, R0, etc. SIR models are powerful and used for implied purposes. We propose an innovative analytic approach by applying statistical change point models, which have been previously employed to model volatility in stock markets, to detect changes in genomic data and data dynamics in other scientific disciplines, to segment the transformed case data. This allowed us to identify possible change or turning points as indicated by the dynamics of daily COVID-19 incidences. Specifically, our analytic approach consisted of two parts. The first was to use a B-spline model 2 to estimate the trend of the original cases (say cases at day , = 1, \u2026 , , where n is the number of days available in the particular country's data). The spline regression models are traditional nonparametric methods used in trend fitting of data. The B-splines are constructed from polynomial pieces joined by some points called knots (indicated by blue vertical lines in panel A of all figures). These knots are determined by a model selection criterion so that piecewise local polynomials between the knots can together give the best prediction of the overall trend of the incidences. These knots, however, are not necessarily the statistical change points of the trend.",

The daily incidences in many countries have shown different moving average with varying dispersion (volatility) over different period, indicating piecewise changing mean and variance. Therefore, a statistical change point model is a natural choice for identifying change points in the mean and variance of the data. The model assumes that the data are approximately normally distributed. To satisfy this assumption, we first transformed the number of cases to a normally distributed number of cases (say with = \u221a + 3/8). While the probability distribution of the coronavirus cases ( 's) can be assumed to be Poisson, 4 the transformed values 's are approximately normal. 5 For situations when the mean and variance change point is not able to detect any change points due to the reasons such as the transformed data may actually deviate from the normality assumption or the changes in mean and variance were not exactly piecewise, we used a Bayesian Note that at the time of this analysis, the WHO data had some negative new cases reported for a few countries; those negative case numbers were replaced by 0.",

The last CI for China showed the estimated average case number from March 25 to June 5 ranged from 18 to 35, indicting a containment. In Korea, there were 12 cases of the novel coronavirus disease on February 1, 2020. Korea was able to better control the outbreak through a strategy of mass screening, quarantines in local areas, contact tracing, physical distancing, and a national mobile phone alert system to warn residents of the movements of affected individuals to detect possible outbreaks.13,14 Our analysis results showed that Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand have seen spikes in earlier days of the breakout in their respective countries and are now in containment (see Supplemental and the last CI for each of these four countries in",

This is an iterative computing process via a Bayesian framework by assuming the mean and variance follow certain prior distributions, respectively. A point (date index) is found to be a change point if its posterior probability of being a change point > 0.50. The posterior probability is calculated according to the algorithm developed.7 The identified change points combined with the spline-fitted trend can provide interpretation of how the change points may have provided better or sooner mandate dates for the implementation of public restrictive interventions in each country.
