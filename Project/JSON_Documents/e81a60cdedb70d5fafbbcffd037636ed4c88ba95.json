The age ranges 87 of both the COV+ and COV-cohorts are comparable (Figure S1a). However, the COV+ group 88 has significantly older study participants (p<0.0001). The COV+ group is also enriched for 89 African American, male, and non-smoking individuals. There was no significant difference in 90 the body mass index (BMI) between the two groups (Figure S1b). 91 Out of 274 COV+ individuals, 253 were admitted to the hospital and 129 of those patients 92 were admitted to the ICU. As expected, the incidence of both factors (hospitalization and ICU 93 admission), were significantly increased in the COV+ cohort. Treatment of severe COVID-19 94 cases often results in intubation and mechanical ventilation (Goyal et al., 2020). In total, 49 of 95 the COV+ patients required mechanical ventilation, whereas only four COV-individuals 96 required mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate in the COV+ group was 19%, which was 97 significantly higher than in the COV-group (6.0%). A total of 52 COV+ patients died, with 48 98 of the deaths being attributed to COVID-19 and 4 being attributed to other causes. 99 Out of 274 COV+ patients, 253 showed at least one COVID-19-related symptom mentioned 100 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) including fever, chills, conjunctival 101 congestion, nasal congestion, headaches, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, nausea or 102 vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell (CDC, 2020).

To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted 26 metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time 27 points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive 28 model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time 29 of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of 30 longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease 31 progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we 32 validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results 33 indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to 34 stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus 37 SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis (Wu et al., 2020b) . As of January 2021, more than 38 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and resulted in over 2.1 million 39 deaths (2020d). The infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced with the appropriate 40 care (e.g., intensive care unit beds, staff, extracorporeal life support, and therapeutics). Such 41 resources are limited, however, and with fewer than five million individuals in the United States 42 fully vaccinated, they continue to be in high demand (2020d). In the United States, one out of 43 five hospitals with an intensive care unit (ICU) has at least 95% of their ICU beds full (Conlen 44 F., 2021) and fewer than 150,000 patient courses of casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal 45 antibodies have been distributed (2020c). Availability of bamlanivimab, the only other 46 monoclonal antibody that currently has emergency use authorization, has been similarly limited 47 (2020b). 48 To reduce mortality, patients who develop critical illness from COVID-19 must be treated 49 early in the disease course before the onset of severe symptoms (Kim et al., 2020) . 50 Unfortunately, COVID-19 progresses rapidly and it is currently difficult to determine which 51 subset of infected patients will develop life-threatening disease (Kattan et al., 2020) . If these 52 patients could be identified, however, then the limited amount of resources available could be 53 optimally allocated to save the greatest number of lives. To this end, the objective of the current 54 study was to identify metabolites in patient plasma that accurately predict life-threatening cases 55 of COVID-19 prior to the onset of severe symptoms. Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma) was measured repeatedly as a quality control (QC) and Figure S2c but no longer clustered based on batch ( Figure S2d ).",

We used admission to the ICU during disease progression 153 to classify patients as having severe or non-severe disease, as has been done previously 154 (Arunachalam et al., 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020 ). An ideal biomarker panel would allow an 155 individual presenting at the hospital and receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR-test result to be 156 screened for metabolic markers associated with severe disease progression to guide the best 157 treatment at the earliest stage of hospitalization. Thus, we grouped the presented COV+ cohort 158 into a non-severe (COV+ non-severe) group that did not require ICU admission and a severe 159 group (COV+ severe) that did require ICU admission.

Multiple studies have established that patients 59 infected with SARS-CoV-2 have metabolic dysregulation, possibly due to immune-triggered 60 inflammation or other changes in host physiology (Fraser et al., 2020; Kimhofer et al., 2020; 61 Overmyer et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). To date, 62 however, unique alterations in metabolites upon SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been validated 63 in large patient cohorts. Moreover, metabolites have not been profiled longitudinally from early 64 after infection through recovery to assess which changes are indicative of disease course. 65 In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomics profiling on the polar and non-polar 66 fractions of over 700 human plasma samples collected from 341 patients as part of the WU-350 67 cohort recruited during the first phase of the pandemic in St. Louis, MO. Untargeted 68 metabolomics allows for the unbiased profiling of the human metabolome (Patti et al., 2012) and 69 has been successful at discovering metabolite biomarkers associated with disease pathology 70 (Beger et al., 2016). Using machine learning, we built a predictive model of COVID-19 disease 71 severity based on the metabolic profiles of samples collected from patients at hospital 72 presentation.

The 707 197 metabolites that composed the metabolic profiles served as the predictors for our ML model. To 198 assess predictive power, we split our dataset into two distinct groups: a training set (165 patients) 199 that we used to select, optimize, and train our ML model and a test set (98 patients) that was only 200 used to evaluate the model's performance (Figure 1c, Table S1, Table S2).

For the mock group, plasma 421 was harvested on days 4 and 14 relative to the infection timeline. All plasma samples were 422 subjected to the same LC/MS workflow as described above. Of our 25 metabolite predictors, all 423 but PC 20:4_20:4 was detected in the hamster plasma. We compared samples from the three 424 groups (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and mock) harvested on d4, when the disease was fully 425 established (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020). Figure 6b summarizes the significantly 426 changing predictor metabolites (p<0.05, Welch's ANOVA) across the three groups. The LPCs 427 showed the same trend as what was observed in the human samples (i.e., a significant depression 428 when compared to the control group). For all significantly varying metabolites, with the 429 exception of PE 16:2_20:4, infection with the influenza virus showed a similar trend of . This is consistent with lower rates of body weight loss in influenza virus-432 infected hamsters as compared to those infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we wanted to 433 determine whether the predictor metabolites in hamsters showed a similar recovery trend over 14 434 days of infection to what we observed in human patients over a period of 84 days of infection. 435 Indeed, there is a similar trend in the SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters (Figure 6c) as in the 436 human COV+ samples when compared to the d4 control (mock) samples. LPC levels dropped 437 significantly on d4 and slowly recovered towards the control levels on d14. By comparison, in 438 the influenza virus-infected group, levels of most metabolites approached that of the control 439 group more rapidly (Figure 6d).",
