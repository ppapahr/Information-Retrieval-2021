For instance, Morgan et al [13] reported correct hand washing by about 40% of wearers and Osborn et al [26] reported that 41% of daily disposable contact lens wearers did not wash their hands with soap before lens insertion. However, the improved compliance with handwashing in this study is not surprising given the strong recommendations of washing hands regularly to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. In line with this, the free text comments provided by the respondents emphasised an improved technique in terms of frequency and thoroughness when washing hands during the pandemic. In contrast, drying hands showed less consistency in the responses (48% using a towel shared with others in their household and only 10% using paper towels). In view of these findings, ECPs and the wider stakeholders in the sector (e.g. CL-related professional associations) should further educate wearers around the importance of drying hands to increase compliance with this critical step. [27] Unintentional exposure to water during lens wear was also reported, as some respondents admitted to cleaning the lens case with tap water and/or showering whilst wearing contact lenses. These non-compliant behaviours have previously been reported by others.

Consistent with the results of Dumbleton et al [14] , this study reports that 11% of respondents lengthened the wearing period of their lenses beyond that recommended by their ECP. As a result of lockdown, CL practice has drastically changed and currently UK wearers are discouraged from attending for routine CL checks. [6] Instead, optometric practices have introduced telehealth and/or face-to-face consultations for emergency services only. In this context, adhering to ECPs recommendations is extremely important, but 18% of the respondents stated they will not consider ceasing lens wear if feeling unwell (with cold or flu symptoms). This highlights important areas to stress when remotely assessing patients to ensure they remain problem-free during the pandemic. In addition, in agreement with previous research [13 14] this study also reports a high noncompliance with lens care and lens case care (Figure 1b) . One of the limitations when using online surveys is that respondents may provide inaccurate information.

[15] This study has found soft daily disposable lens wearers showed statistically significant better levels of compliance with lens wear and care when compared to soft reusable lens wearers (daily wear). Jones et al [6] argued that given the reduced incidence of corneal infiltrative events in wearers of daily disposable lenses [30 31 ] this form of lens wear seems ideal in a time of reduced clinical provision. In agreement with this, the present results indicate that the simplicity of daily disposables offers a significant advantage as opposed to the complex steps required to achieve full compliance with reusable lenses. [18 19 ] However, swapping a patient to daily disposable lenses of the same stated parameters does not result in the same lens fit [32] and telemedicine is not at a stage where lens fit can be accurately assessed remotely [33] , so unless the patient has worn a particular soft daily disposable contact lens before, changing during the pandemic is not a safe option. During these challenging times, practitioners have been asked to exercise their professional judgement when monitoring the care of contact lens wearers. [34] Should clinical provision remain limited over the forthcoming months, ECPs will need to ensure that contact lens wear remains safe and that whenever possible wearers are directed towards wearing lens modalities that reduce the chance of developing contact lens-related complications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 727, "end": 730, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 840, "end": 846, "text": "[30 31", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1146, "text": "[18 19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1275, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1366, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "4.Discussion"}, {"text": "Morgan et al [13] found similar levels of compliance with lens wear among different European countries. Given that lockdown measures have been implemented differently across the world, further work should explore whether similar CL compliance habits have been reported elsewhere. The present results may not be fully transferable to other countries undergoing different restrictions during the lockdown. In addition, given the small proportion of rigid lens wearers in the UK [24] the current study was limited to exploring compliance of soft reusable lens wearers. The current sample size has limitations but the survey closed as guidance on social distancing changed when the government message changed from \"Stay at Home\" to \"Stay Alert\". Poorer compliance in males as compared to females has previously been reported. [13] In the present study only 21% of wearers using reusable lenses with multipurpose solution were male, so this should be kept in mind when interpreting the findings from this study. In addition, with an online survey the possibility always exists for self-report bias as well as self-selection bias where those more compliant with lens wear and care might be more likely to complete the survey. If this was the case, this will make the current findings even more significant to ECPs. Hind et al [35] noticed that optometrists do not routinely offer written advice regarding contact lens wear and care information. Thus, another limitation of the present work is that an assumption is made that wearers have been instructed appropriately in the first instance, but it is possible that poor compliance steams from inadequate information being given during initial instruction on lens care. [36] Finally, it is worth noting that 89% of respondents did not feel the need for any additional support managing their contact lens wear during the pandemic.
