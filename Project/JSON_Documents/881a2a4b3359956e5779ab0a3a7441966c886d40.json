However, changes in Quality of life and mental health status due to pandemic-related is less known. This study was implemented to investigate and predict changes in the Quality of life and psychological changes in people worldwide due to the pandemic. 3002 individuals participated in an online survey. The result showed that Quality of life is significantly decreased over time, meanwhile perceived stress level is raised significantly, and an increased level of difficulty in emotion regulation has happened. Almost everyone faced with increased perceived stress and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of perceived stress escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a worsening quality of life response tended to show more stress and emotion regulation problems. Furthermore, prediction models show that by extending the time of quarantine, Quality of life will worsen, and therefore the rate of perceived stress will be higher, and the problem with emotion regulation will arise more. As the whole world faces the pandemic, this research provides several implications for public mental health intervention.",

Figure 1 shows the mean of all scales on the map; each area's high range has been colored with orange color. To understand each scale, we calculated the mean of scores for all scales, which were 21 for Covid-19 QoL; 30 for Perceived stress; 32 for Reappraisal; and 20 for Suppression (table 3 ). Our research also shows that a high cut score of Quality of life among our users is related to a high perceived stress and emotion regulation. This is confirmed by other studies that there is a linear correlation between the Quality of life and psychological behavior such as stress and emotion regulation [3, 14, 16] .",

That which is apparent is the number of dead cases regarding the virus, losing jobs due to the economic crisis. Also, fear of infection to the virus dramatically and negatively impacted people's lives worldwide [18] . Another side 9 of this research mentions that some of the continents like Australia and New Zealand, despite having a high quality of life, are more faced with psychological and behavioral impairment due to the pandemic, which can be considered. The most critical factor, such as Quality of life in developing countries versus underdeveloped countries, shows that the pandemic impacts countries with a low-income rate and a low standard of life. Though this research has not been specified to the countries, we have done surveys based on the continent. However, our data still shows that developed countries are more faced with the pandemic's behavioral and psychological impacts.",

Perceived stress consolidates feelings about the wildness and unconventionality of one's life, how frequently one needs to manage difficult issues, how much change is happening in one's life, and trust in one's power to manage issues or troubles. It is not estimating the sorts or frequencies of Stressful occasions that have happened to an individual, thus far instead how individuals feel about the general stressfulness of their life and their capacity to deal with such stress. Peoplemay endure comparable contrary life occasions; however, assess the effect or seriousness of various degrees because of elements, for example, character, adapting assets, and backing are still important, and by this way, perceived pressure mirrors the collaboration between an individuals and their condition[5,10].",
