Identification of interventions to improve MOUD retention is of interest to policymakers and researchers. On behalf of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, we conducted a rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from February 2009 through August 2019 for systematic reviews and randomized trials of care settings, services, logistical support, contingency management, health information technology (IT), extended-release (XR) formulations, and psychosocial interventions that assessed retention at least 3 months. Results: Two systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included; most did not focus on retention as the primary outcome.",

Retention was comparable with XR-compared to daily buprenorphine formulations and conflicting with XR-naltrexone monthly injection compared to daily buprenorphine. Most psychosocial interventions did not improve retention. Discussion: Consistent but sparse evidence supports criminal justice prerelease MOUD initiation, and contingency management interventions for antagonist MOUD. Integrating MOUD with medical, psychiatric, social services, delivering through IT, or administering via XR-MOUD formulations did not worsen retention. Fewer than half of the studies we identified focused on retention as a primary outcome. Studies used different measures of retention, making it difficult to compare effectiveness.

Therefore, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned this rapid evidence review on interventions to improve MOUD retention to assist the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agency stakeholders in their decision-making and current work.

In 2018, an average of 128 people in the US died each day of opioid overdose. 1 There is clear evidence, including a recent report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), that people with OUD who receive medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are less likely to die from overdose, 2,3 engage in less illicit opioid use, and experience improved quality of life. 4 Three medicationsmethadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone-are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of OUD. 5 Although remission from opioid use may be most protective against overdose and morbidity, remission is not always achievable due to treatment gaps along the OUD cascade of care continuum (ie, diagnosis, engagement, initiation of MOUD, retention, and remission). 4 Longer retention on MOUD is associated with improved mortality; however, retention rates are low and variable, with 30% to 50% reported in most settings.

One was a small poor-quality study (n \u00bc 15) that randomized inmates to XR-naltrexone monthly injection versus TAU and found that more than 20% of prerelease participants continued receiving treatment at 6 months versus none in the postrelease group. 29 The second was a fair-quality study (n \u00bc 213) that assessed the effectiveness of prerelease initiation of buprenorphine compared with referral to begin an office-based buprenorphine treatment program after release and found higher retention in the prerelease group, measured as mean number of days in treatment at 12 months (65.9 days vs 21.8 days, P \u00bc 0.005). 20 Care Setting: Integration of MOUD With Psychiatric and Primary Care Services Three small (n range \u00bc 94-316) fair-quality RCTs provide conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of integrating primary or psychiatric services with OUD treatment to improve retention on MOUD.

Rewards for abstinence ranged from nonmonetary vouchers to take-home medication privileges. Meta-analysis of these trials showed no differences in retention (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.08). 14 Among the additional 7 RCTs we included, 4 assessed contingency management with full or partial agonist forms of MOUD and, similar to the SR findings, found no differences in retention between groups. 26, [33] [34] [35] The remaining 3 studies assessed contingency management with antagonist MOUD. [30] [31] [32] Two of these studies (total n \u00bc 73) provided access to a workplace where study participants could earn vouchers to exchange for goods and services contingent upon receipt of XR-naltrexone monthly injections, and found that nearly twice as many intervention group participants received all scheduled monthly injections compared to controls who had noncontingent access to the workplace (66% vs 35%, P \u00bc 0.026 30 ; and 74% vs 26%, P \u00bc 0.004 31 ). The third study (n \u00bc 67) also provided access to the workplace contingent upon acceptance of daily naltrexone formulation, and similarly showed improved retention in the intervention group at 26 weeks (54% vs 16%, P < 0.01). 32 A follow-up analysis conducted 6 month after completion of the study found no difference in medication adherence between the 2 groups (31% noncontingent vs 17% contingent, P \u00bc 0.66). 32 Table 4 , http://links.lww.com/JAM/ A213).

The largest study was a fairquality industry-sponsored RCT (n \u00bc 1426) that enrolled all patients into office-based buprenorphine treatment and randomized them to receive ''Here-To-Help'' (HTH) patient phone support intervention that provided coaching for medication adherence and access to online educational materials compared to office-based buprenorphine treatment alone (TAU). At 12 months, ITT analysis found no differences in retention between groups (55.5% HTH vs 56.1% TAU, P \u00bc NR). However, planned posthoc analyses reported that intervention participants who completed more phone coaching sessions had higher treatment retention compared to TAU (64.4% vs 56.1%, P < 0.025). 38 A retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada (n \u00bc 3733) tested the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention on MOUD retention in areas with limited treatment access. The intervention allowed methadone-stabilized patients to receive care with an off-site physician via videoconference, while on-site nurses delivered guideline-concordant care. Just under half (47%) of patients received >75% of services in-person, 42% received >75% of services through IT, and 11% through a mix, with 25% to 75% of the therapy delivered via telemedicine. Compared to the mostly in-person group (39% retention), patients receiving mostly IT visits and patients who received a mix of IT visits were more likely to be retained in MOUD at 1 year (50% retention, aOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.41; 47% retention, aOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.47, respectively). 42 Few studies reported harms associated with IT interventions. One RCT that assessed the effectiveness of combining methadone treatment with an adjunct phone-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention reported 12 adverse events among 82 study participants (17% in the intervention group and 12% in TAU, P \u00bc NR). None were related to the intervention. 37 None of the studies assessed whether the effectiveness of IT interventions varied by patient characteristics. Findings of a secondary analysis within an RCT that compared in-person counseling versus a combination of in-person and computerbased counseling (Therapeutic Educational System), found that counseling delivered using this combination may improve treatment retention among patients who are employed, highly anxious, ambivalent about opioid abstinence, and who have a history of crack cocaine use in the past 30 days. 44 ",

Eighteen overdoses (64%) were in the XR-naltrexone arm and included 8 participants who failed treatment induction and never received an injection. Five overdose events were fatal (2 in the XR-naltrexone group and three in the daily buprenorphine/naloxone group). 45 None of the studies assessed whether the effectiveness of XR-MOUD formulations to improve retention varied by participant characteristics. examined psychosocial interventions (eg, psychiatric care, psychotherapy, counseling, social work services) 14 to improve MOUD retention (Appendix Table 6 , http://links.lww.com/ JAM/A213).",

Potential reasons for this include between-study differences in the comorbidity burden of study populations, in dosing of comparator buprenorphine, and in study design (randomization before medically-supervised withdrawal versus postwithdrawal). Further comparative effectiveness trials are necessary and are underway, including a Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative trial that will assess retention at 6 months and can provide muchneeded evidence in this area. 67 Our review of psychosocial support interventions (excluding contingency management) found no differences in retention, consistent with a prior systematic review. 68 The lack of effect may due to heterogeneity of the interventions studied, difficulties assessing fidelity of such interventions, as well as inclusion of elements of psychosocial support in the control groups, as is standard of care. 18 Given these limitations, RCTs may not be the optimal study design to assess effectiveness and other evaluation methods may better assess the impact of these interventions on retention.",
