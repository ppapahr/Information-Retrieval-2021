In the 209 final adjusted analysis, we found 17 factors independently associated with an increased hazard of 210 death: male sex, older age, arterial hypertension, obesity, liver cirrhosis, chronic neurological 211 disorder, active cancer, dementia, dyspnoea, confusion, low age-adjusted SaO2 on room air, higher 212 white cell blood count (WBC), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet count, 213 prolonged INR, lower eGFR, and higher concentrations of CRP (Figure 2) . No collinearity was 214 detected, the proportional hazards assumption was fulfilled, and the results were not changed 215 when the order of entry of the blocks was inverted. Kaplan-Meier plots for death according to age 216 and sex are shown in Figure 3 . The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of death for being admitted early 217 in the epidemic (before 13 March) vs later was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90; 1.28), 218 P=0.407. The variable unilateral or bilateral lung opacities had missing values in 29% individuals 219 and was not included in the final model. However, when this variable was included in the model, 220",

It is not surprising thus 234 that mortality was substantially higher in Spain (28%) and the UK (26%) than China (1.4 and 235 3.2%). Presenting features were similar in all cohorts.

Abnormal vital signs at admission 167 included fever (40.9%), arterial hypotension (18.8%), and marked tachypnoea (10.9%). Low age-168 adjusted SaO2 levels on room air were reported in 26.6% of patients (see web-only 169 Supplementary Table S3). 170Chest radiograph findingsInfiltrates on initial chest radiograph were observed in 77.6% patients, of which 71.3% had 172 bilateral involvement. Over the whole hospital course, worsening of the baseline infiltrates was 173 observed in 64.7% of patients, with new lesions in 51.0%. 174Baseline laboratory findings are shown inTable 2. The most common abnormalities in blood 176 counts included lymphopenia (54.2%) and thrombocytopenia (31.5%). The median (IQR) 177 neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was 4.5. A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time 178(APTT) was present in 9.4%, and 57.1% had D-Dimer levels above the normal range. High serum 179 (14.2%).

Ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined in a limited 184 number of patients, and high concentrations of these parameters were found in 75.1% and 90.0%, 185 respectively. 186Supportive therapy and medicationsHigh dependency unit or ICU admission was required for 18.5% patients, 15.5% underwent 188 mechanical ventilation, 11.9% received vasopressors, and 3.0% received renal-replacement 189 therapy (see web-only SupplementaryTable S4). Viral targeted agents were administered to 190 82.0% of patients: lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (65.5%), and 191 subcutaneous interferon-beta (29.2%), usually in combination with LPV/r. Host-targeted agents 192 included systemic corticosteroids in 28.0% patients and tocilizumab in 9.4% patients. Antibiotics 193 other than azithromycin were administered to 80.9% patients and antifungals to 3.2% (see web-194 only Supplementary Table S5). 195 Complications and mortality 196 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The full list of complications during the hospital course is shown as supplementary material (see 197 web-only Supplementary Table S6); the most common were ARDS (31.5%), acute kidney injury 198",
