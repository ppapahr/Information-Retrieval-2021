The purpose is to describe the theory, design, and rationale of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase of an iteratively developed physical activity intervention for metabolic syndrome. The feasibility results of the proof-of-concept phase are presented. Methods: Participants are adult primary care patients at community health centers with metabolic syndrome and low physical activity (target n=64). The 8-week group intervention consists of weekly physical activity goal-setting and self-monitoring, positive psychology activities, and neighborhood walks. Participants rate feasibility and acceptability of sessions. Pre-postintervention, and 24 weeks later, participants complete accelerometers, questionnaires, and biometrics. Feasibility results: Eight participants enrolled and seven completed. The median number of group sessions attended was 7 out of 8. Average ease and usefulness of sessions were rated as 7.0 (\u00b10.5)/10 and 8.1 (\u00b11.0)/10, respectively, indicating feasibility and acceptability. Average pre-post physical activity increased by 2152 steps and 29.25 minutes of MVPA/week.",

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Sperling et al., 2015) . Health behaviors, including physical activity, are critical for reducing the development of MetS and related diseases (Orchard et al., 2005; Lakka and Laaksonen, 2007) , but most people don't achieve recommended activity levels (Fappa et al., 2008) . Multiple factors influence physical activity, from individual to communities (Sallis, 2018; Sallis and Owen, 2015) . Intervening on physical activity at multiple levels can reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs (Lakka and Laaksonen, 2007; Dietz et al., 2015) .",

Positive psychology (PP) constructs such as optimism, self-esteem, and positive affect are associated with lower risk of developing MetS (Boylan and Ryff, 2015; Yancura et al., 2006) and adherence to physical activity and health behaviors (Lawton et al., 2009; Van Cappellen et al., 2018; Rhodes et al., 2009; Huffman et al., 2015) . PP interventions increase positive psychological states (e.g., optimism, positive affect) through structured activities such as increasing awareness of positive events and cultivating optimism (Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009; Bolier et al., 2013; Chakhssi et al., 2018) . A related intervention is Motivational Interviewing (MI), a patient-centered approach to behavior change that clarifies motivation, ambivalence, and goals (Miller and Rollnick, 2002) . MI has been used to help people increase physical activity and other health behaviors (Christie and Channon, 2014) . Combining PP and MI may leverage the complementary strengths of both strategies to influence change more than either approach alone (Huffman et al., 2015) .",

The PP exercises were adapted from evidence-based interventions and based on previous work with medical patients (Bolier et al., 2013; Chakhssi et al., 2018; Huffman et al., 2015; Huffman et al., 2016) . The physical activity goal setting and selfmonitoring content was created using a patient-centered MI approach (Koh-Knox, 2009 ). PP and MI have been shown to integrate effectively in prior studies of medical populations based on a previously published model (Huffman et al., 2015; Huffman et al., 2019) (Figure 2 ). Briefly, increasing positive psychological states through PP interventions, such as optimism and determination, may increase motivation and adherence to health behaviors (Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009) . Simultaneously, MI helps reduce ambivalence, increase self-efficacy, and combined with behavioral goal-setting, allows people to move toward valued goals (Koh-Knox, 2009; Michie et al., 2011) , such as increased physical activity and improved health. Furthermore, increased salience of positive emotions during physical activity can increase conscious and nonconscious motivation and reinforce the behavior as described in the Upward Spiral Theory of Lifestyle Change (Van Cappellen et al., 2018) . Building upon these models, the present intervention expands beyond the individual level and broadens its scope to incorporate the interpersonal targets of social benefits in a group intervention, which are widely used in health behavior change programs, emphasizing social support, peer motivation, and accountability (e.g., the Diabetes Prevention Program; (Diabetes Prevention Program Research, 2002) ). Further expanding through the levels of the ecological model of health behaviors (Sallis and Owen, 2015) , MAPP also includes a focus on education, exploration, and assessment of each clinic's surrounding neighborhood built environment and walkability ( Figure 3 ). To assess neighborhood walkability (features that support walking, such as sidewalks and crosswalks), during the midpoint of the intervention, participants are asked to walk a new route in their neighborhood and use the MAPS-Mini audit tool to evaluate their walking environment.",

This is done by sending an email to PCPs with a list of potentially medically eligible patients (from the RPDR search) and asking PCPs to approve or deny the study's contact with their patients.

The positive results of these feasibility and acceptability measures suggested that the adapted version of the intervention was suitable for use in the next phase RCT.

Therefore, in the RCT, the additional pre-visit consent session was added, and the dietary information sheets were included in the manual as described above.

            "text": "Our proof-of-concept study's findings are largely consistent with prior PP and PP-MI interventions among medical populations. A recent meta-analysis of PP interventions among clinical populations found small-moderate effect sizes (.23-.36) on mental health outcomes such as well-being, depression, and anxiety (Chakhssi et al., 2018) . The present study also found improvements on depression, anxiety, and components of well-being, such as mental healthrelated quality of life, dispositional, and state optimism, with large effect sizes. While PP-MI combined represents a newer intervention, the present study is consistent with prior PP-MI trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome and heart failure showing high feasibility and acceptability, improved positive affect, depression, and anxiety (Huffman et al., 2016; Celano et al., 2018a; Celano et al., 2018b) . In terms of health behavior outcomes, prior PP-MI studies among patients with cardiovascular diseases have shown improvements in adherence to health behaviors, such as taking medications, adhering to a low-sodium diet, and engaging in selfreported physical activity (Celano et al., 2018b; Huffman et al., 2019) . The present study builds on prior PP-MI interventions by expanding the levels of influence to include social support (groups) and exploration of the built environment walkability and behavioral rehearsal (weekly group walks). This MetS multilevel intervention framework is a useful model for making sustainable changes by intervening at multiple targets that circumscribe behaviors like physical activity (Sallis & Owen, 2015) . Individual interventions are rarely sustainable in isolation, but interventions that include changing social norms or providing social support, in combination with improvements to the built environment and policies, can create lasting changes in behaviors like physical activity (Sallis, 2018; Sallis and Owen, 2015) . Using this framework, the present intervention uses the ORBIT model of sequential intervention development (Czajkowski et al., 2015) by first tailoring the individual-level PP-MI content for this largely sedentary population based on qualitative interviews (manuscript under review) and the PP and MI content that can be effective for individuals. Regarding PP, the upward spiral theory of lifestyle change suggests that when people are aware of positive emotions experienced during a health behavior (e.g., physical activity), the behavior is reinforced and continued (Van Cappellen et al., 2018) , such that an intervention focused on promoting well-being could then amplify. Increased positive affect also increases people's internal emotional and cognitive resources, which can increase the salience of the positive emotions gained from a health behavior, and the cycle allows participants to be able to set and achieve realistic goals, attune to positive emotions experienced during activity, and feel greater pride, determination, and optimism about their physical activity. At the group level, the social support gained from the group sessions was another notable strength, which is reflected in the BBAQ social support subscale improvement and such support has been associated with maintaining health behavior change (Berkman et al., 2000; Latkin and Knowlton, 2015) . Finally, the weekly group walk introduced participants to new places to be active in their local environments, reinforced their ability to walk safely, and allowed them to build additional self-efficacy for finding ways to walk despite their prior barriers.",
