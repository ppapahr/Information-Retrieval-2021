This pandemic has taxed our healthcare system and disrupted normal operations, even of lifesaving procedures like liver transplants. During these unprecedented times providers and patients are imperiled and resources for diagnosis and care may be limited. Continuing to perform resource intense advanced procedures is challenging, as is caring for patients with endstage liver disease or patients with urgent needs for liver tumor control. Liver transplantation in particular requires critical resources like blood products and critical care beds, which are fairly limited in the COVID19 pandemic. The potential of COVID19 infections in post-transplant patients on immunosuppression and staff contacts further adds to the complexity. Therefore, transplant programs must re-evaluate the ethicality, feasibility, and safety of performing liver transplants during this pandemic. Herein, we discuss the clinical and ethical challenges posed by performing liver transplants and offer guidance for managing patients with end-stage liver disease during the COVID19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Patients with HCC on the wait list or eligible for listing for liver transplant should continue their care due to the risk of tumor progression with delays. To this end, multi-disciplinary recipient review committee and tumor board meetings should continue uninterrupted if possible. Though outcomes on COVID19 in HCC patients are unknown, a recent study evaluating 18 cancer patients from Wuhan, China found them at increased risk for severe disease [20] . During this COVID19 pandemic in which we are trying to minimize unnecessary patient contact and inperson visitation, risk models and biomarker panels could stratify those patients at highest risk of HCC development to best prioritize those that need imaging [21] , However, these models have not yet been externally validated. Per the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), highest priority for imaging should be given to those patients with suspected HCC lesions, for assessing tumor treatment response, assessing potential distant metastases and for patients with hepatic decompensation [22] . Though semi-annual surveillance does increase early detection [23] , no studies compared surveillance intervals of 4-8 months, and it is therefore reasonable to delay imaging if needed. A recent study by Rich et al that looked at HCC doubling rates found that the median doubling time was 292 days, however in 25.1% doubling time was <90 days along with a longer doubling time in patients with non-viral cirrhosis. Interestingly, rapid growth was seen mostly in smaller tumors whereas larger tumors exhibited more indolent growth. This follows the theory that HCC exhibits sigmoidal growth patterns as larger tumors may begin to outgrow their blood supply [24] , [25] . This raises a slightly challenging scenario however in which delay in imaging and identification of these smaller tumors may ultimately preclude future curative options such as transplant or resection. At the same time, the findings that larger tumors exhibit longer tumor doubling time may argue that treatment can potentially be postponed. For this reason, there should be open discussion with patients with clear documentation of plans including the risk and benefits of delaying imaging or HCC treatments. Another important factor is that the sensitivity and specificity of screening ultrasound, which is the current recommended imaging modality per various professional societies remains sub-optimal, especially for early lesions [26] . Up to 20% of ultrasound studies will be classified as inadequate, and a different imaging modality is required for accurate evaluation of lesions, with about a 5% false-positive rate [27] , [28] . A study by Atiq et al et al looked at physical harm from HCC surveillance. They defined this as any follow up testing including CT or MRI scan, liver biopsy or angiography performed for a false-positive or indeterminate result. They found that over 25% of patients endured physical harm for false positive results [29] . In this COVID19 era in which we face challenges to obtain imaging and perform treatments we must be cognizant of the limitations of our current screening strategies and accept that, this may result in further exposures and possible harm to our patients. For this reason, we stress the importance of individual clinical evaluation to decide which patients can safely delay imaging at this time.",

They discussed potential bridging options for all stages of treatment because transplant and resection presents the highest risk for nosocomial infection while also utilizing the most resources (operating room, critical care bed and blood products). ESMO denotes patients with high priority for intervention as those listed for transplant with HCC with either acute on chronic liver failure, high-MELD, or with tumor burden nearing the upper limit of Milan criteria, as well as patients in which curative surgery is an option for large or multifocal lesions [22] . As ~10.5% of wait listed patients have a primary diagnosis of HCC, and a third of all transplants performed for this indication [8] , identifying which candidates can safely delay transplant is quite critical. Mehta et al evaluated patients with HCC on the transplant list and noted an overall dropout rate of 15.1%. Those with a single lesion (2-3cm), Child Pugh A, MELD<15 and AFP<20 predicted lower risk for dropout, and therefore these criteria may guide identification of patients in whom transplant can be delayed [30] . Lastly, for patients on systemic therapy, it has been recommended that oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors are preferred over infusion based regimens to minimize nosocomial exposures [31] .",

Telehealth visits and local laboratory testing should be encouraged. It is noted that telehealth has various barriers in regards to the delivery of care. There are currently restrictions regarding telehealth care across state lines which disadvantages patients that are in regions without local availability of advanced hepatology care [33] . While some transplant programs had prior established infrastructure to deliver telehealth in the pre-COVID19 era, many programs did not, due to regulatory and/or reimbursement limitations. So there remains a nationwide discrepancy in the ability to successfully implement these programs at an equivalent rate [34] . We must also be cognizant that certain demographics, such as the elderly or lower socioeconomic strata may lack access to equipment or to the internet and limited technological proficiency to engage in telehealth delivered care. We must continue to engage, motivate and offer clear and directed instructions to these patient populations during this time. On March 6th, 2020 the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (H.R. 6074) was passed and temporarily lifted certain CMS restrictions regarding telehealth care [35] .

Deceased donor liver transplants, however, encompass all the aforementioned categories and therefore require urgent triage given the expeditious and critical nature of the procedure. Notably, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently classifies transplant surgery as a Tier 3b procedure, and therefore not an elective surgery [41] . In this direction, surgical societies like American College of Surgeons (ACS) and specifically the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) and British Transplantation Society (BTS) formulated guidance documents to facilitate the decisionmaking for transplant surgeons [42], [43] , [44] . The guidance illustrates that elective surgery like living donor liver transplants be postponed (assuming the recipient can wait). This is because the double equipoise of living donation which seeks to balance donor risk with recipient benefit is compromised. For deceased donor liver transplants, the transplant team must be cautious and critically evaluate each organ offer for the specific recipient in light of resource availability, impact of immunosuppression and presence of a robust convalescence plan.",

Certain highly afflicted regions are currently not able to offer transplants given the lack of assurance that high quality critical care and the necessary resources are available. Travel bans and restrictions along with inadequate and inaccurate COVID19 testing has led to challenges and reductions in organ procurement [45] . The principle of distributive justice in choosing how to ration the available resources may be the most challenging.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor which is highly expressed in bile duct cells, and prior data shows the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the liver as detected by PCR, we assume that transmission is likely [50] , [51] . One case series reported that up to 15% of patients with COVID19 had detectable circulating viral RNA [52] . Therefore, the majority of Organ All recipients should undergo testing, and if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2, their transplant be delayed, if possible [13] , [38] . We must be aware that COVID19 testing by nasopharyngeal sampling has fairly low sensitivity (56-83%), and thus negative results, especially if inconsistent with clinical history, should be interpreted with caution [55] , [56] . Though there are other sampling sites including oropharyngeal and saliva samples that can be used for testing, the IDSA recommends nasopharyngeal testing for symptomatic patients, as this sampling site has higher sensitivity. Additionally, though lower respiratory tract samples including sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage have better sensitivity, the IDSA only recommends this type of sampling if the upper respiratory testing is negative and if there is a high clinical suspicion [57] . Lastly, there are also a variety of serologic tests available for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with the CDC's ELISA-based test showing greater than 99% specificity and 96% sensitivity. However, given the uncertainty of how to interpret these tests in regards to transmissibility or protective immunity, the CDC and IDSA are not recommending this form of testing for diagnosis or important policy decisions [58], [59] . Patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 or have suspicious clinical history or symptomatology, or receive an organ from a potential COVID19 positive donor should be placed under contact and airborne isolation, and providers should follow the recommended (local and/or CDC) personal protective precautions [54] .",

When choosing a donor with potential COVID19 infection based on test or history/symptoms, the risk of transmission puts the organ procurement members, the healthcare providers involved in the surgery and post-transplant care and recipient at risk of infection. Given the unknown outcomes in immunosuppressed patients infected with COVID19 and knowing that viral shedding may be prolonged [63] , infection in recipients could lead to disease transmission or even a potentially lethal outcome. In addition, given the lack of evidence-based data on outcomes of certain experimental COVID19 treatments in our transplant patient population, we may ultimately cause more harm if the treatment is administered. It is for this reason that many organs are being declined when donor COVID19 testing is not readily available, especially organs recovered from high incidence areas or where donor illness or exposure raises concern for COVID19. For living donation, in addition to the standard surgical risks living donors accept, the risk of nosocomial COVID19 infection has led many programs to temporarily suspend living donation programs for liver transplant [13] , [64] , [54], [42] .",

Though such decisions are made at the programmatic level, discussion and appropriate education of patients will help maintain their autonomy, albeit limited. Recipient selection is guided by the four ethical pillars of the Principlism theory [65] . In regards to 'beneficence', liver transplant is life saving and the gold standard treatment for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure and in selected cases hepatocellular carcinoma [6] . In addition, after a successful liver transplant, there exists the possibility that recurrent hospitalizations or frequent clinic visits from complications of liver disease may be avoided, thus reducing the risk of COVID19 infection. The principle of 'nonmaleficence' helps guide the balance of risk and benefit when deciding who should undergo liver transplant in this pandemic. Patients in whom emergent liver transplant is not indicated, patients who have certain high-risk co-morbidities [15] , and patients who are at higher risk of developing severe COVID19 disease may outweigh the benefits of transplant during this time. Alternatively, those with emergent indications such as acute liver failure with its highest survival benefit from a timely liver transplant have a favorable balance to the benefit versus risk of a COVID19 infection during their post-transplant phase. In regard to 'justice', certain programs may approach transplant candidates viewing those that would have the maximum benefit by utilizing the least amount of resources. Patients with severe portal hypertension and or re-do liver transplant candidates with anticipated higher needs of blood products, or those with isolated pulmonary complications that may require extended ICU care may not be best suited for transplant during this time if transplant can be safely delayed. However, if programs expect to only offer minimal number of liver transplants, perhaps only the emergent patients with the highest survival benefit should be accepted despite their risk of a more complex hospitalization.",

            "text": "The limited data on the use of immunosuppression post-liver transplant in COVID19 positive patients is based on experience from various centers, and thus far it does not appear that patients on immunosuppression have a more severe disease course. For example, in Lombardy, Italy where over 25,000 COVID19 infections have been confirmed, Bhoori et al reported outcomes on their liver transplant patients. They noted that from their long-term posttransplant cohort (>10 years out) 3/111 died following COVID19 infection. Each of these patients were on monotherapy with a low dose calcineurin inhibitor, and all were male, age >65 years, overweight (BMI >28kg/m 2 ), on antihypertensive agents and had diabetes. Notably the CDC views these demographics and medical conditions as high-risk for severe illness from COVID19 infection [15] . In their recently transplanted patient cohort (within 2 years), 3 out of 40 had COVID19 infection and all had mild course without the need for hospitalization. Thus a conclusion can be derived that immunosuppression does not seem to increase the risk of severe COVID19 disease, as the mortality rate in their cohort was 3% compared to the 10% case-fatality rate in the rest of Italy [81] . We do however lack both data on the risk profile of the three patients who were infected and the long-term impact. Another case series from the main pediatric liver transplant center in Italy found no increased risk of severe pulmonary disease after evaluating around 200 patients, including patients with cirrhosis, post-transplant patients, patients with autoimmune liver disease and patients on chemotherapy for hepatoblastoma. Of this group, three were confirmed to have positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, though it was felt this was likely under-estimated given the reported high prevalence in their population [80] . Due to this initial data and the emerging evidence that suggests the innate immune response is the main driver of lung tissue damage [82] , the current guidelines do not recommend to reduce or stop immunosuppression in an asymptomatic liver transplant recipient [14] , [38] .",

Initial therapy and an early episode of acute cellular rejection would warrant use of high dose steroids, however whether steroid free regimens should be considered and current protocols for treating rejection modified to reduce steroid exposure is uncertain given the lack of controlled data. Currently, the AASLD recommends in immunosuppressed patients with COVID minimizing the dose of high-dose prednisone, reducing azathioprine or mycophenolate dosages and reducing but not stopping calcineurin inhibitors when lymphopenia, fever or worsening pneumonia is present. In patients with COVID who need modification of immunosuppression, such as those with graft rejection or an autoimmune flare, treatment should proceed with close monitoring [13] .",

The prolonged future use of telemedicine will also offer advanced hepatologic care to certain disadvantaged patients far from expert care, hopefully helping to resolve some disparities in quality and access to care [88] . Utilizing local laboratories and providers as part of the care team along with the transplant center was part of the pre-pandemic care model and will be even more important in the future. However, the pandemic has also disrupted many primary care practices, and transplant centers may have to assist patients with care beyond immunosuppressive management to fill gaps in our patients needs until a new equilibrium is restored in the community.",
