The COVID-19 pandemic has already changed the world, with entire nations under quarantine, and billions of people grappling not only with the risk of serious illness, but the economic consequences of widespread interruptions of business. Hospitals not only must deal with the challenge of caring for an overwhelming number of patients infected with the virus causing this disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), but also need to maintain emergency services for patients with other medical conditions. Essential to both of these missions is the continued availability of safe blood for transfusion. Pertinent issues include a threat to the blood supply presented by COVID-19, as well as strategies that can be used to potentially reduce dependence on allogeneic blood during this worldwide health crisis.",

Interruptions to the supply chain, such as major weather events like hurricanes and snowstorms, and even summer vacations, when donors are not donating, almost always result in serious concerns about the viability of the blood supply; however, during this pandemic, it is more severe and sustained.",

The Food and Drug Administration suggests that individuals refrain from donating blood when symptomatic and for at least 28 days after resolution of symptoms after a diagnosis of COVID-19, or 28 days after the last possible close contact exposure to a person with COVID-19. 4 Importantly, neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration has required any further specific action with regard to mitigation of a recipient complication.",

These changes have been variable from hospital to hospital, but have included cancellation of elective surgeries and procedures, suspension of living related solid organ transplants and autologous stem cell transplants, reduction of blood utilized by chronic sickle cell exchange programs, and heightened awareness of the risk of a blood shortage. Thus, the reduction in blood supply has been met in part by a reduction in demand. As the COVID-19 pandemic carries on, the blood supply will most likely be impacted by elasticity in both supply and demand, as further community spread of COVID-19 or additional government restrictions on free movement could exacerbate supply limitations, and rescheduling of previously elective surgeries as urgent cases may lead to increased demand.",

Data from China, published in late March 2020, showed improvement among critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving treatment with convalescent plasma; however, only five patients were included, and the study was not randomized, nor was there a control group. 8 Three clinical trials have been proposed, each of which awaits final approval by the Food and Drug Administration. 9 The first is a randomized trial to determine whether convalescent plasma prophylaxis can prevent infections in high-risk populations. The second, also randomized, will assess whether convalescent plasma can prevent severe disease in patients who are already infected. Finally, a single-arm trial will assess whether convalescent plasma improves outcomes in patients who are critically ill. Collection of convalescent plasma, however, presents multiple challenges, including public confusion when donors are suddenly being recruited, rather than denied, for having recent COVID-19 disease.",

In many ways, patient blood management is all about doing \"more with less,\" which allows us to close the gap between supply with demand. Multiple large randomized trials demonstrate that patients do either as well, or better, with lower compared to higher hemoglobin transfusion triggers. But patient blood management is much more than simply recalibrating the erythrocyte transfusion trigger. We have previously reported more than 20 patient blood management methods of improving blood utilization, 10 which result in reduced transfusion requirements for all three major blood components (erythrocytes, plasma, and platelets), while achieving similar or improved clinical outcomes.",

For example, a single-unit transfusion policy called \"Why Give 2 When 1 Will Do?\" for erythrocytes does more to reduce overall transfusion requirements than simply monitoring the hemoglobin trigger. Furthermore, Choosing Wisely guidelines support giving one unit, then reassessment. 11 Antifibrinolytic therapy (e.g., tranexamic acid) 12 is universally available and an inexpensive method of reducing bleeding and unnecessary transfusions for non-COVID-19 patients. Other methods of reducing dependence on allogeneic blood include preoperative anemia management, maintaining perioperative normothermia, cell salvage, minimally invasive surgical techniques, acute normovolemic hemodilution, evidence-based massive hemorrhage protocols, point of care coagulation testing, and institutional transfusion guidelines along with corresponding clinical decision support (pop-up alerts) in the electronic medical record.",
