We performed descriptive analyses for this outbreak. RESULTS Between March 24 and April 24, 2020, 27 of 562 tested patients were confirmed positive, of whom 5 (18.5%) were suspected as NIs. For HCWs, 52 of 697 tested positive, and 40 (76.9%) were considered NIs. Among transmissions, 95.5% were suspected of having occurred during the asymptomatic period. Large-scale isolation and testing at the first sign of outbreak terminated NIs. The number of secondary cases directly generated by a single primary case found before March 31 was 1.74, compared to 0 after April 1. Only 4 of 28 primary cases generated definite secondary infection, which were all asymptomatic.",

This high proportion could be due to two reasons: one was the limited acceptance of new COVID-19 patients due to the temporary decline in hospital functions, and the other was that the rate of communityacquired infection in Japan was considerably lower than that in other reports. In addition, although the HCWs adhered to universal masks, hand hygiene and standard precautions during medical practice, there may have been many transmissions outside of practice, such as during use of the staff lounge and eating with other staff members. The implementation of self-quarantine of the hospital staff with close contact for 14 days, universal masking, visitor restriction, and social distancing have been previously reported [25, 26] ; however, in the event of a larger scale nosocomial infection, as presented here, a more consequential decision, such as ward closure, may be necessary. Prompt and rigorous implementation of containment measures led to successful control of the viral transmission.",

In the hospital, symptomatic individuals were immediately isolated and carefully controlled, and as a result, infection from symptomatic individuals was unlikely to occur, with the majority of infections coming from asymptomatic individuals. In addition, 19 of 42 asymptomatic transmissions were observed from a single cluster, which also contributed to the rise in numbers for asymptomatic transmission. Reports on COVID-19 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 16 have demonstrated a large percentage of presymptomatic cases [9] [10] [11] and the finding of presymptomatic carriers infecting others [11, 12, 27] . When clusters were discovered, aggressive contact tracing, thorough isolation regardless of PCR results or the presence of symptoms, and testing of highly-exposed persons was conducted, which allowed us to suppress further infection. In particular, for cluster A, all employees in the ward were NIs of COVID-19 in our hospital did not occur from every case in the same manner: most cases did not infect anyone, and only 4 of 28 primary cases resulted in clusters. This suggests that even if the reproductive number is large, the spread of infection may be impeded by isolating the most contagious individuals or circumstances that give rise to many infections. The large variance of the number of secondary cases generated by a single primary within the hospital, which is a confined space, is consistent with the findings observed in CAIs in Japan [28] .",

Presumptive sources of infection are shown in Table 1. Of the 44 transmissions, including both patients and HCWs whose presumptive sources were identified, 42 (95.5%) were transmissions from asymptomatic sources, including 19 transmissions among the resident physicians' cluster, and 2 (4.5%) were transmissions from sources that were symptomatic but not confirmed positive at the time. Most of the asymptomatic transmissions were presymptomatic, although the resident physicians' transmissions could not be clearly distinguished because of the group infection. Although all HCWs wore surgical masks during patient care, nine were likely to have contracted the virus from infected patients who had not yet been confirmed positive. A total of 31 HCWs were suspected to have contracted the disease through staff-to-staff transmission, such as working in a shared medical office and taking meals in a staff lounge.",

Our measures were new in that we closed wards and performed extensive staff self-quarantining rapidly when nosocomial infections were recognized; and because COVID-19 transmission occurs in the asymptomatic phase, follow-up measures and contact tracing only may be inadequate if the number of cases increases. In such cases, large-scale measures such as those we took might have been as effective as the lock down that took place in the city. Quarantine of HCWs can temporarily result in staffing shortages and a reduction in patient care activities. However, implementing active work restrictions, regardless of the PCR results or the presence of symptoms, on a large-scale basis at the first sign of an outbreak is essential, especially for COVID-19, where major outbreaks can occur from transmission by presymptomatic individuals.The mean number of secondary NI cases directly generated by a single primary case was calculated to be 0.62. This number before March 31 was 1.74, whereas that after April 1 was 0, after more aggressive measures had been taken. This value of 1.74 is considered to reflect the reproductive number when the hospital was taking the traditional standard precautions with universal mask and isolation measures for symptomatic workers. This number may contain a margin of error because it was challenging to distinguish between nosocomial and community-acquired infections, and misclassification is likely to have occurred. While this number requires careful interpretation, it is still clear that the measures our hospital reduced the reproductive number and brought the NIs under control. In addition, no new chain of infection had been identified by May 8, even after the conduct of comprehensive surveillance of patients and staff with fevers and symptoms.",

First, this is singlecenter descriptive analysis; thus, it is necessary to collect more cases to establish effective measures. Second, the number of nosocomial infections might be overestimated because people defined as NI could have been infected from various sources outside the hospital, including asymptomatic sources. Contact tracing is difficult during epidemic spread in the community, making it challenging to identify the source of infection, if any, in the community. Third, the government declared a state of emergency on April 7 in Tokyo, and the number of confirmed cases peaked on April 16. The spontaneous decrease in CAIs might have contributed to the convergence of nosocomial infections by reducing the number of patients and HCWs with CAIs.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, viral shedding from certain asymptomatic cases played a major role in nosocomial infections with COVID-19 in our institution. Immediate large-scale isolation at the first sign of outbreak, contact tracing, restriction of contact among HCWs, and PCR testing of individuals including asymptomatic ones were effective in terminating the spread of COVID-19 nosocomial infection.",
