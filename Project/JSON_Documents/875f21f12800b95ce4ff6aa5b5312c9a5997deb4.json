Previous systematic reviews have shown that adults released from prison are at increased risk of all-cause 7 8 and external-cause deaths, 8 drug-related deaths 9 and suicide. 10 Additionally, the Mortality After Release from Incarceration Consortium Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba Findings from this systematic review will support the development of evidence-informed approaches to prevent violence-related deaths after release from incarceration. \u25ba The systematic review will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), and is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020209422). \u25ba The systematic review uses a comprehensive search strategy that was developed in consultation with a research institute librarian and comprises seven health, social science and criminology databases. \u25ba To ensure the systematic review contains the highest standard of evidence possible for the outcomes, only published peer-reviewed cohort studies will be included. \u25ba Only studies published in English will be included in the systematic review.",

Two reviews that focussed on the health of young people in detention briefly considered suicide among young people after release, and found that these young people have an elevated risk of suicide in comparison with their community counterparts. 12 13 Cohort studies from high-income countries, such as the USA 14 15 and Australia, 16 have found that young people released from youth detention are at increased risk of all-cause and external-cause deaths. Given the large and increasing number of adults and young people being incarcerated globally, there is a strong imperative to reduce excess mortality among these populations.",

A comprehensive review explicitly searching for violence-related deaths among young people released from youth justice detention is needed, given emerging evidence that these young people have a risk of dying from violence that far exceeds that of their counterparts in the general population. 14 To our knowledge, the evidence on violence-related deaths among young people and adults released from incarceration has not been synthesised at a global level. As such, the global epidemiology of violence-related death after release from custody remains poorly understood. This knowledge is an important prerequisite to the development of evidence-informed approaches to prevent violence-related deaths in these populations.
