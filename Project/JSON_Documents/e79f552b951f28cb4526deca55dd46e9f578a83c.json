Recent Findings The risk of transmission of respiratory viruses including COVID-19 is particularly high due to the overcrowding conditions at the Hajj and Umrah. The profile of the Hajj pilgrims who tend to be older and with multiple comorbidities corresponds to that of individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. In order to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak with potential spreading to many countries through returning pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended the Umrah, and access to the 2020 Hajj was very limited. Summary A clear relation between early suspension of religious mass gatherings and lower occurrence of COVID-19 transmission in countries that took such measures promptly was noticed. There are lessons to national and international health organizations for other mass gatherings in the context of the pandemic.",

Each year, two to three million Muslims from more than 180 countries around the world flock to Makkah for the Hajj pilgrimage [1\u2022] . This is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is compulsory, at least once in lifetime, for all responsible adult Muslims who have the physical and financial capacities necessary to accomplish it. The Hajj takes place every year between the 8th and the 13th of Dhul Hijjah, the 12th and last month of the Islamic calendar. In contrast, the Umrah is another Islamic pilgrimage to Makkah (shorter than the Hajj) that can be undertaken at any time of the year. The Umrah is not compulsory, but is still highly recommended [2] . Umrah during Ramadan is equal to Hajj in terms of religious value, according to a statement that is attributed to the Prophet Mohammad [3] . Together, the Hajj and Umrah involve over 10 million participants each year [4\u2022] .",

As an example, a paired survey realized among 692 international Hajj pilgrims showed that over 34% pilgrims acquired HRV after the 2013 Hajj season [12] . More recently (2014 to 2017), in a 4-year cohort of 485 French pilgrims, 26.9% participants acquired HRV after their pilgrimage [18] . The dynamic of HRV acquisition during the pilgrimage was recently described in French pilgrims [6] . The authors showed an early increase in HRV carriage during the first days of the pilgrimage with a prevalence 24 times higher than that of pre-travel samples. Then, HRV carriage decreased progressively in subsequent samples but was still eight times higher in post-Hajj samples compared to pre-Hajj [6] .",

An outbreak quickly spread to neighboring countries, followed by a wider spread to geographically distant countries [20] . As of September 2019, it involved 27 countries with 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 deaths (mortality rate was 34.4%). The majority of cases occurred in the KSA with 2102 cases reported and 780 deaths (37.1% case fatality rate) [21] . The largest numbers of MERS-CoV cases were reported in 2014 and 2015 with 523 and 452 cases, respectively [11] . However, no cases of SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus were documented in Hajj pilgrims until now [22] , and only a few cases of MERS have been reported among Umrah pilgrims [16] . By contrast, other common HCoVs were acquired by pilgrims during their pilgrimage. Acquisition rate of HCoV 229E calculated from a large paired cohort survey (692 international pilgrims) in 2013 was 14.6% [12] . In paired cohorts of French pilgrim (n = 485) investigated during the Hajj 2014-2017, the overall HCoV acquisition rate was 8.3% (with HCoV 229E the most frequent (6.2%)) [18] with a marked peak during the 2016 Hajj season with a 19.8% HCoV 229E acquisition rate [2, 13-16, 23\u2022] .",

The KSA was one of the countries affected by the virus, with 15,850 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 124 deaths on December 30, 2009 [24] . The first 100 cases in KSA involved travelers at four airports during June 2009 [24] . The 2009 Hajj took place in the last week of November, during the outbreak that had been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009 [25] . The acquisition rate of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among 305 returning Iranian pilgrims after the 2009 Hajj season was 1.6% [26] . Koul et al. conducted a study among 300 Indian pilgrims returning from the Hajj and Umrah in 2014-2015. Their qPCR result showed that 11% were positive for influenza virus, including 9 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 13 cases of influenza A/H3N2, and 11 cases of influenza B [27] . In another study realized among 1600 international pilgrims after the 2010 Hajj season, a total of 7.5% participants were positive for influenza A by qPCR. Of whom, 9 cases were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [28] .",

By example, these is up to 8 persons per m 2 at the Grand Mosque in Makkah during rituals, and 50-100 pilgrims are housed per tent at Mina encampment [34, 35] . Even when the reproduction rate of an outbreak is low, the over density during the Hajj tends to amplify the spread of transmission [36] . The Sri Petaling MG, a Muslim missionary movement with 19,000 participants, including 1500 foreigners from 30 countries, in the suburb of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that took place from February 27 to March 1, 2020, accounted for > 35% of the COVID-19 cases in the country [37\u2022\u2022] . In February 2020, 19.2% (712/3711) of the ship's population on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship were infected by SARS-CoV-2 [38] . The Shincheonji Christian religious group with approximately 200,000 participants gathering in the city of Daegu, South Korea, took an important role in the COVID-19 epidemic in the country. On March 03, 2020, nearly 3000 related cases were reported out of 5621 cases in whole South Korea [39] . A high attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 was observed during a large wedding in Jordan with a total of 76/350 (21.7%) participants tested positive [40] . In February 2020, 8000 pilgrims had returned to different cities of Pakistan from Qom city in Iran where a pilgrimage of Shia Muslims took place. At the end of March 2020, a total of 990 confirmed cases were reported in Pakistan, of whom, 60% were pilgrims returning from Iran [41\u2022] . In early March 2020, a cluster of 48/ 53 (90.5%) COVID-19 cases was documented in Greek pilgrims after a Christian pilgrimage in Jerusalem, Israel [42] . In late March 2020, six pilgrims who attended a pilgrimage at a masjid in Pakistan were detected positive for SARS-CoV-2 in China. During their 6-month stay, they had close contact with thousands of masjid pilgrims without face mask [43] . Finally, in March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started in Arkansas, USA, with two index cases who participated to a Christian event in a rural county [44\u2022] . A total of 35/92 (38%) attendees were confirmed for the SARS-CoV-2, including 3 deaths. In addition, at least 26 additional patients who had contact with these participants were likely infected by them.",

In a meta-analysis of 3027 patients from 13 studies showed multiple factors to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [45\u2022] . Being male and smoking were associated with a twofold increased risk of severe disease. Age older than 65 years was associated with a sixfold increased risk of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 [45\u2022] . In addition, the proportion of chronic diseases was significantly higher in critical and among those who died compared to others, including hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 2.72), [48] . International travel has already been shown to play a central role in the spreading of COVID-19 and international MGs like the Hajj or Umrah, if maintained may well have contributed to the globalization of SARS-CoV-2 through returned participants.

The overcrowding during the Hajj and Umrah is inevitable, and it is difficult to prevent the transmission of contagious diseases in this context. The KSA Ministry of Health recommends individual preventive measures such as use of face mask and disposable handkerchiefs and hand hygiene to mitigate the risk of RTIs. However, the efficacy of these measures against RTIs is debated [35] , and there have been no reliable controlled studies investigating their efficacy on the incidence of Hajj-related RTIs. The use of face masks may not provide optimal protection from infection, but that may reduce the spread of smallsized saliva droplets around when coughing or sneezing which is the main mode of transmission of most RTIs. Mandatory use of face mask in public places is considered one of the effective measures in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [54] [55] [56] , but no investigation has been conducted in the context of MGs so far. In addition, the practice of social distancing, hand hygiene, and contact avoidance was associated with reduced risk of spreading this outbreak [7, 54] .",
