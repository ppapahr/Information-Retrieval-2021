We consider here a nested representation of uncertain information in intervals using Dempster-Shafer evidence approaches. These representations can be used in variety of applications including spatial and temporal reasoning and economic cost valuations. Two representations of nested intervals, RP1 and RP2, are defined and used in the paper. Basically an inner interval represents the more certain data and is nested in the outer less certain interval. We illustrate how the specificity measure could be used to evaluate such nested Dempster-Shafer intervals. We then consider Gini information measures applicable to the RP1 representation. We describe an example using our interval approach to COVID contact tracing in epidemiology. Finally examples of aggregation of intervals are provided. It is seen that an aggregated result can be evaluated and shown to increase the specificity of the result. Additionally, it is not always the case that aggregation increases specificity. An example is given illustrating such a case.",

Depending on the disease and the context of the infection, family members, health care providers, and anyone else who may have knowledge of the case's contacts may also be interviewed (Hellewell et al. 2020) . We can illustrate this with a generalized example of a specification of distance and time when it was not possible to exactly determine the exact distance and the information was even possibly solicited from multiple sources or persons. Obviously it is important to make this decision as carefully as possible. If we commit to no close contact then we may face a false negative and consequently risk further infectious exposures.

Does the aggregation produce an interesting or valuable result? We have previously developed a number approaches to aggregations of uncertain information-probability and possibility distributions (Petry et al. 2015; Anderson et al. 2016) . To assess the effectiveness of these aggregation results we applied information and specificity measures (Elmore et al. 2020; Petry et al. 2015) . Here, in order to use these measures for nested interval aggregations, we have to consider restricted cases to illustrate that the specificity metric can determine if an aggregation produces a more specific and potentially useful result.",
