The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has committed 1 billion dollars to vaccine development efforts, starting with 3 of these pathogens: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Lassa virus, and Nipah virus (2) . These 3 pathogens, as well as others on the World Health Organization's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Vaccine efficacy (VE) against susceptibility to infection (VE S ) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, because infection may contribute to onward transmission and to outcomes such as congenital Zika syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, estimation of VE S is resource-intensive, since it requires testing of all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial or by performing serological testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccinederived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing of trial participants is also necessary for estimating vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VE P ), another critical outcome measure (8) . As Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. (15) noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may differ from protection against infection (and, in the case of dengue, VE P may be negative because of antibody-dependent enhancement) in general.

Throughout this paper, we use \"asymptomatic\" synonymously with \"subclinical\" to mean any infection episode which does not generate sufficient symptoms to prompt testing that would reveal the participant to be currently infected with the causative pathogen. METHODS We model a vaccine trial by first generating a model of a main population and a network of individuals grouped into communities, the structure of which has been described previously (see Web Table 1 , available at https://academic.oup. com/aje, for parameters) (16) . The model is compartmental, using deterministic (differential equation) dynamics for the main population and stochastic dynamics in the communities. We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil (17) . The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected persons transmit the virus to their susceptible contacts in the community. All susceptible persons have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious contacts of 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 433, "end": 440, "text": "METHODS", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 702, "end": 706, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 628, "end": 639, "text": "Web Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The disease natural history follows a \"susceptible-exposedinfectious/symptomatic (or infectious/asymptomatic)-recovered\" model, with estimated incubation and infectious periods of a Zika-like disease (Web Table 1 ).

Symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are assumed to be equally infectious, and whether a person is infected by a symptomatic individual or an asymptomatic individual does not affect their probability of becoming symptomatic. The baseline parameters of the model assume that 20% of those infected in both the vaccine and control groups become symptomatic, based on the estimated proportion of Zika virus infections that are symptomatic (9) .

The vaccine is imperfect (\"leaky\"), meaning it reduces but does not eliminate the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious person.

VE S is estimated by means of 7 different approaches, which are described in Table 1 . Trial status (i.e., vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and persons who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day), even for asymptomatic infections, and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing was performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and persons infected asymptomatically are assumed to survive without infection to the end of follow-up.

Approach 6, the interval-censored Cox model with testing only at the end of the trial, yields the same results as approach 5, testing 3 times, without substantial difference in coverage probability or power in the settings considered (Table 2 and Figure 3 ). Thus, both approach 4 and approach 6 yield accurate estimates, with testing only required once at the end of the trial. Even a single serological test could be resource-intensive. Approach 7, which only requires testing 10% of the trial participants at the end of the trial, results in accurate estimates of VE S (Figure 2 ) for all values of R 0 considered and accurate estimates of VE P (Table 3) for R 0 values of 1.25 or 1.50. Only testing 10% of the trial participants once at the end of the trial substantially reduces required resources.

When the vaccine has an effect on both susceptibility to infection and progression to symptoms, serological testing helps differentiate Figure 1 . Differential misclassification of at-risk person-time. Panel A shows reality-who is truly infected and who is truly still at risk. Panel B shows who we perceive to be infected and still at risk when considering only symptomatic individuals. When considering only symptomatic events, presumed person-time at risk increases for both the vaccine group and the control group, because all persons with asymptomatic infections are now perceived to be uninfected and at risk for the entire period of the trial. In the vaccine group, 11 people are perceived to still be at risk (panel B), when in reality only 7 remain at risk (panel A), since 4 people are asymptomatically infected. In the control group, 10 people are perceived to be at risk (panel B), when in reality only 2 remain at risk (panel A). Because there are more people infected and therefore more people incorrectly still perceived to be at risk in the control group than in the vaccine group, apparent incidence is underestimated in the controls more so than in the vaccine group, leading to bias towards the null. This bias is exacerbated as R 0 increases and more people in the control group become infected but are still perceived to be at risk.
