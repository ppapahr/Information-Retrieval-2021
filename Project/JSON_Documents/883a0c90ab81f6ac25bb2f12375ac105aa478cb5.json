Against this background, the first aim of the paper is to demonstrate the value of thinking about crisis analytically. Therefore, we introduce theoretical knowledge developed within a recently emerging literature on crisis management.

Uncertainty denotes 'that we cannot predict or foresee what will happen when acting or not acting' (Aspers 2018, p. 133) . In the corona case, uncertainty is caused by a lack of knowledge (e.g. about the ways of infections, dark figures of a-symptomatic cases), ambiguous signals (e.g. unspecific symptoms), a lack of viable means to counter the epidemic (e.g. the absence of an effective medicine and vaccination) and undetermined timeframes (e.g. when will a vaccination be available), to mention only few. The second ingredient, urgency, refers to the necessity to act, despite high degrees of uncertainty. In crisis, inactivity and non-decision are no options as they will only exacerbate the serious situation. Yet, as acting has to take place under conditions of uncertainty, routines are no longer available and action has a strongly improvisational or experimental character (Boin & Rhinard 2008; Milstein 2015) . The last ingredient to crisis is an existential threat of highly valued societal assets. The corona pandemic does not only threaten the health and lives of wide parts of the population, but also imperils economic interests and core institutions of the political order. Due to the underlying fundamental uncertainty, 'the emotional response to crisis is not fear (such as fear from fire) but existential angst, which has no identifiable object that could offer a grip for a learnt response' (Kornberger et al. 2020, p. 242) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 121, "text": "(Boin & 't Hart 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 223, "end": 244, "text": "(Aspers 2018, p. 133)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1028, "text": "(Boin & Rhinard 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1043, "text": "Milstein 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1568, "text": "(Kornberger et al. 2020, p. 242)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "UNCERTAINTY, URGENCY, THREAT: INSIGHTS FROM CRISIS RESEARCH"}, {"text": "In addition to these fundamental characteristics of crisis it is important to unpack the term a bit further. It is important to understand how crisis becomes enacted in practice. A crisis as an empirical observation cannot be deduced directly from the underlying societal conditions. Rather similar, objectively measurable conditions (like unemployment rates, levels of distrust in political institutions) sometimes entail crisis diagnosis, and sometimes do not. Sometimes relatively unimportant issues are treated as a crisis (the 'Brent Spar' controversy is a widely cited example of an escalating risk communication; L\u00f6fstedt & Renn 1997) , while even the most alarming scientific reports about climate change are not sufficient to mobilise a collective sense of urgency.

In our observation of the public discourse in Germany, at the beginning of 2020 the government as many others in the Western hemisphere looked at the early epicentre of the pandemic, the Wuhan region in China, 'with a combination of fascination and fear' but without any sense of urgency or immediate threat until new information about corona infections in Europe emerged (Boin et al. 2020) . Not earlier than 26 February 2020, we noticed a shift from 'corona epidemic' to 'corona crisis' in the German speaking debate for the first time in an article published in the online portal of the German newspaper Der Spiegel. Two days earlier, in many parts of Germany, carnival was celebrated on the streets -a mass meeting with thousands of people standing close to each other. From 16 March onwards, all public events of major size were prohibited, schools were closed across all Federal States in Germany and a few days later restaurants, production plants and retail shops followed. It was a matter of days, during which the publicly shared framing of the situation has changed fundamentally. Typically, at some stage in the public 'framing contest' that takes place in advance of a crisis, the public opinion transcends an invisible 'tipping point' beyond which a problematic situation turns into a crisis (Boin et al. 2009 ). However, this tipping point can only be noticed ex post, while it is impossible to determine it in advance.

For decision-makers, once in place, the crisis immediately ascends the first place of the agenda. Due to the performative qualities, the crisis unfolds its dynamics irrespective of subjective interpretations or experiences. For individual decision-makers, it is for instance no longer possible to ignore the crisis, or, if one tries, like Donald Trump did until the first weeks of March, it happens at immense political and economic costs. For professional crisis managers, the declaration of a crisis has very practical and robust consequences. They perceive a crisis as an effective 'coping structure' (term used in crisis management practice jargon) societies and organisations have to prioritise a certain topic and to mobilise resources to address a problem. Crisis diagnoses emerge in multi-stakeholder constellations. Some stakeholders even support the escalation of a crisis or reframe the crisis diagnosis in ways that exert pressure on organisations or states.

Crisis, in other words, is strongly associated with the idea of an open future (Kornberger et al. 2020 ) that can be created through individual or collective agency. In the current crisis, the first discussions emerge about the potential long-term structural effects of the corona crisis. For instance, visionaries from Silicon Valley highlight the enhanced possibilities to establish new practices of remote digital learning and work (Thrun 2020) .

Under such conditions, action does not take place within a given frame of meaning. Rather, in crisis participants are forced to learn by interpreting the situation tentatively while acting on it. Therefore, crises are usually perceived twice. In a first loop, participants encounter a critical turn in the course of events surprisingly. They experience an open-ended phase of chaos and escalation during which they struggle to regain control while action and sensemaking remain incompletely connected. In contrast to the abrupt beginning, the end of the acute crisis comes much more gradually. As a first step toward a (new) normality, after having responded to the challenges, participants eventually perceive a slowing down in the dynamic of escalation and try out new interpretations of the situation. However, against the background of the previously experienced uncertainty, participants tend to distrust this new stability. They remain unsure, how far their explanations will hold and whether or not the absence of another surprising turn is just a pause in the course of escalation or already a (re)turn to (new) normality.

When reflecting on the pre-crisis phase, the focus is on weak warning signals that have been neglected beforehand or wrong decisions that contributed to an escalation of events. The post-crisis phase, in contrast, provides the (oftentimes missed) opportunity to learn from the crisis (Birkland et al. 2009 ). Once the crisis is overcome, time is ripe to reiterate the acute crisis several times in order to get a detailed understanding of the sequential order of actions.

For example, a paper published in March 2019, in which the authors warned against (at that time) future outbreaks of a corona virus caused by cross-species transmission (Fan et al. 2019) has received broader attention in the last weeks, that is one year after publication. In China and in Italy suspicious accumulations of pneumonia cases attract the attention of epidemiologists aiming at reconstructing the outbreak.

On the territorial level, 'transboundary crises' (Boin & Rhinard 2008) have an inter-regional or even an inter-national character. Transboundary also denotes the overstepping of institutionalised boundaries, for example, the vertical sectoral responsibilities of political or administrative bodies (Boin & Rhinard 2008) .

Such external events can unfold disruptive qualities, yet they are usually easier to manage, as no decision-maker can be directly blamed for them. It thus seems sufficient to manage their negative consequences before returning back to old normality. More difficult are crises that are driven by internal sources. For instance, the structural crisis of a whole industry to a wide degree is caused by the insufficient strategic capabilities of the core decision-makers. Here, the crisis is interpreted as a 'brutal audit' (Orton & O'Grady 2016 ) that unveils the lack of foresight and understanding of decision-makers. Crises caused by internal factors enact a much higher degree of uncertainty, as any framing of the problem goes hand in hand with blaming of responsible persons or organisational units (Boin et al. 2009 ).

The total number of confirmed cases worldwide is presented on the national level. Recently, a further map demonstrating the intensity of the outbreak in US counties has been launched by the university (Johns Hopkins University 2020). The territorial representation of the corona crisis is largely caused by the report system of public agencies which are bound to territorial units. Likewise, many institutional crisis responses, such as the official declaration of an emergency situation, are bound to territories. However, territory affects crisis even beyond administrative responsibilities. The crossing of a territorial boundary, for instance, frequently cause shifts in the perception of crises as being more threatening (since the perceived distance to crisis declines) and escalating (fear of losing control).

As places of food provision, in times of lockdown these facilities have transformed rapidly into critical infrastructures equipped with additional safety precautions. In contrast, hospitals represent classical institutions of crisis response. Yet, when becoming activated for this crisis, their regular safety standards needed to be adapted to the particular challenges of the corona pandemic. The notion of scale is closely related to spatial hierarchies (Jessop et al. 2008) . It is a particularly important dimension in crises when it comes to negotiation of responsibility and coordination of action (which scale is the right one to (re)act on crises?). The corona crisis provides a vivid example here. In Germany, for instance, the corona crisis induced a discussion of the federal constitution. Where in other states, the national governments decided about the closing of retail stores, etc., the national government in Germany is not authorised to decide about such measures since infection protection is situated at the federal state-level (Bundesl\u00e4nder) (Leitlein & Schuler 2020) . Moreover, the health authorities, which report about confirmed corona infections and are authorised to impose measures such as quarantine, are based on the level of administrative districts (Landkreis) or district-free cities in Germany. Located at an inter-national scale, the WHO receives particular attention in these days. Though not authorised to impose measures, the WHO has an important function in terms of policy recommendation. The WHO's declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak being a 'pandemic' on 11 March can be interpreted as a means justifying considerable state interference with fundamental rights.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 236, "text": "(Boin et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 284, "end": 303, "text": "(Ibert et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 537, "end": 550, "text": "(Merlot 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1110, "text": "(Jessop et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1722, "text": "(Leitlein & Schuler 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Space dimension Examples from Corona crisis Territory"}, {"text": "The network perspective on crisis focuses on the relations between nodes (of every kind).

A similar topological perspective on crisis has been elaborated by Fredriksen (2014) . The author focuses on emergency infrastructure which is used in different humanitarian crises. According to the author, emergency tents as material objects, which have constantly been developed further after crisis experiences, represent 'lessons learned' from different crises.

The different levels usually present territorial units where the smallest level is always fully integrated in the next larger level (municipal level, national scale, European scale, etc.). This leads to the key issue of coordination in crises. A certain threatening situation has to be assigned to a specific scale, responsible for crisis response. These responsibilities are usually determined beforehand. In the corona crisis, the formal assignment of authority in epidemic events (as mentioned, the federal states (Bundesl\u00e4nder) are responsible instead of the national government in Germany) is now critically eyed and political efforts have been started to change the respective law in order to allow the upscaling of competencies to the national level in such crises (Waschinsky 2020).

Determining the right scale, activation of respective structures when necessary and flexible adjustments in territorial scaling are central issues of crisis management.

While Sweden followed the approach of vaccinating large parts of its population, Denmark decided to recommend vaccination for risk groups only.

In Germany, in contrast, authorities declared a prohibition of social interaction. German citizens are thus still allowed to leave their homes, as long as they follow the commandments of keeping a minimum distance to other citizens of 1.5 metres and seeking only the company of members who live in the same household or at most one other person.

Therefore, surgical masks played a major role in some national policies in the East-Asian context while they have been ignored in most Western contexts.

Moreover, crisis has performative qualities. A crisis diagnosis thus is not primarily a proper description of reality, but a creator of a new reality in which uncertainty, urgency and threat predominate, no matter if decision-makers like it or not.

It could support approaches that seek to adapt policies to different regional characteristics (e.g. social distancing policies for urban or rural regions) or to regionally unequally affected areas (e.g. hotspots of the crisis vs. little or no affected areas). Second, and related to the first point, systematically thinking about the geography of crisis can contribute a lot to the question of scalarity in crisis. The corona crisis (as many other crises) demonstrates the challenge of defining the scale of the crisis and respective crisis response strategies (which scale is the right one to (re)act on crises? How to choose the right scale? Does the chosen scale necessarily have to match with a territorial unit?). In fact, due to its transboundary character it evades any single scale and instead calls for complex strategies of multilevel governance adapted to the institutional idiosyncrasies of different nation states. Third, the corona crisis forces the rapid implementation of several new practices such as avoiding hand contact in supermarkets. Thus, specific places transformed into critical localities, rapidly equipped with special safety infrastructure. The transformation of specific places is observable in our daily lives; however, it cannot fully be understood without references to other similar places.
