The genome for this novel virus was then made publicly available on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) the next day. SARS-CoV-2 is an easily spreadable virus which would evolve into a global pandemic of at least 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths 2 . One of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak was Iran. The country reported its first confirmed case on 19 th February 2020 from a merchant in Qom who travelled from China 3. . Many of the first countries with infections in the Middle East were linked to travellers from Iran including Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman and UAE. COVID-19 continued to spread to the remaining Middle Eastern countries with a death toll of over 50,000 people according to health authorities. This number is expected to be an underestimation due to countries effected by war including Libya, Syria and Yemen. Needless to say, there have been devastating effects to the region and the real effects are expected to be unreported 4 .",

SAR-CoV-2 is transmitted using the spike protein which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor; the virus is easily transmittable due to mutations in the receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domain of the strain 5 . Transmission could be made even easier if more mutations accumulate. Although mutations are rare, they can create new strains and it is not guaranteed that the current leading vaccine trials will be effective as SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate 6 . By categorizing variants, we can identify any new strains and how the mutations are likely to affect spread. As the Middle East is often under reported, it is important to characterise the variants of strains that are commonly present. Analysis of the common variants in the Middle East is essential to develop a vaccine that treats the strains in the region. This analysis helps understand the viral genome landscape and identify clades of the region.",

We utilised the Galaxy platform and uploaded our VCF file to Galaxy using their online upload tool. To annotate variants, you must first build a database from the reference genome. This is performed using the \"SnpEff build\" tool on Galaxy. To create the SnpEff database, we downloaded data from NCBI for Wuhan reference NC_045512.2 and uploaded to Galaxy. To build the database, we directed to NCBI and searched for NC_045512. We then downloaded the corresponding GFF file, which contains the annotations, and the FASTA file, which contains the entire genome. We then selected the build database option. Once the database was built, we selected the \"SnpEff eff\" tool to annotate variants. Galaxy populates the fields for VCF with the uploaded file from the previous step. The output format is selected as VCF and CSV report was also selected for additional useful information for downstream analysis. For Genome source parameter, the option \"Custom\" was selected to use the newly created database. Other default parameters were used including 5000 bases for Upstream / Downstream length and 2 bases as set size for splice sites (donors and acceptor) in bases.

The analysis followed the approach recommended to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of an epidemic. The aim of this is to obtain an estimate of the origin of the epidemic in the region and understand how it spread through the Middle East. To undertake the analysis, we opened BEAUTi, the graphical application used to analyse the control file. Although it requests a NEXUS file, the FASTA file can also be used. The data was uploaded using the Import Data option and appeared under the Partitions section. BEAUTi confirmed that 30851 sites are present in the uploaded data. The default options are selected for site model and clock model. Next, we specified the individual virus dates by selecting the \"Tips\" panel and selecting the \"Use tip dates\" option. A tab delimited file was uploaded which specified the upload date. This information was extracted from the names as they were downloaded from GISAID. Next, we set the substitution model by selecting the \"Sites\" tab and selected the default options of HKY model, the default Estimated base frequencies and select Gamma as Site Heterogeneity Model. Next, the molecular clock was selected under the \"Clock\" tab as a strict clock since we know that the frequency of mutation is low. The tree options are elected under the \"Tree Prior\" tab as \"Random starting tree\" for the tree model and \"Coalescent: Exponential Growth\", a model that assumes a finite but constant population size and predicts that all alleles will be removed from the population individually. This provides additional predictions on the reproductive rate. In the \"Priors\" tab, select the scale as 100 for prior distribution which models the expected growth for a pandemic. The operators require no changes from the default. The MCMC option for chain length is set as 100,000 and sampling frequency to 100.",

Once this is complete, the annotated variants were extracted to generate a plot mapping variants, grouping samples by country. The plot as seen in Figure 1 , shows clear distinctive patterns within countries that are not obvious from the generated alignment and annotation files. This may indicate a diverse, new strain is circulating in the country. Cyprus has little diversity in the variant mapping which is surprising given its late date for first reported cases. Another interesting point is that time-varied samples were taken for countries with 10 samples. We see not indication that there are distinct groups within countries. This further indicates the the mutation frequency is low. It also indicates that there is more variation in the genomic composition in samples from different countries than differences found in samples from different collection times. Smaller populations can cause greater accumulation of variants through genetic drift. This may occur given local lockdowns and travel restrictions that have been enforced worldwide. It is possible that these genomic strains with new mutations may create a situation where the countries develop a deathly strain that is not prominent in other parts of the world. This could result in a situation where a country is disproportionately affected by accumulating deaths or an inefficient vaccine.",

These examples are indicative of the global response -the lockdown of each country and prevention of spreading has resulted in SARS-CoV-2 strains of great similarity within each country. If lockdowns were not enforced, it is likely that these clades would be less distinguisable as mutations are spread between countries. As we expected, 2 of the highest branches points attach to Iranian samples, further implementing Iran in the initial spread across the Middle East. The phylogenetic tree therefore indicates what we suggest in our hypothesis -most samples originate from the Iranian sample. This is not surprising given the vast number of cases and early crisis state of the country. However, it is useful to see that the variant analysis shows what we suspect at the genome level. A related study also came to this conclusion by using contact tracing from cases related to religious events in the city of Qom, Iran 16 .",

One Iranian sample has many more variants than orders. The Saudi Arabia also appears to have a low mutation rate which may be due to their early contraction of the virus.
