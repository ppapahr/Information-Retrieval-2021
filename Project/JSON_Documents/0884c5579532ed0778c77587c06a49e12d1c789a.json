From a functional standpoint, some of these cytokines (IL-10, IL-15 and IL-21) may be involved in B cell survival, differentiation into plasma cells and class switching, while others may impart an inhibitory effect on B cells in certain situations (e.g. IL-8, IFN-\uf067) [18] [19] [20] . In addition, it has recently been reported that individuals with inborn errors of type I IFN immunity is associated with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia [21] . Of note, some of the analytes tested (e.g. IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-16, and VEGF-A) were significantly lower in CCP donors than those from the control cohort, the biological relevance of which requires further investigation.

Transfusion of plasma with elevated levels of some of these cytokines, could contribute to some of the biological effects associated with CCP administration in COVID-19 patients. In this regard, the administration of these cytokine and chemokines may have an immunomodulatory effect in less critical patients via amelioration of the severe inflammatory response (e.g. anti-inflammatory IL-10) and/or antibody production (e.g. IL-21 in plasma cell generation).",

Even in outpatients with milder COVID-19 illness, delay in complete recovery with prolonged symptoms like cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath has been reported in the US [28] .These studies demonstrate that individuals have markedly different inflammatory states long after symptoms have resolved, and these may contribute to the lingering symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath, cough, gastrointestinal problems, headache, or fatigue) reported in the COVID-19 long-haulers. Thus, the levels of CCP cytokines and chemokines provide important insights into overall recovery status of the convalescing patients, as well as its suitability as a therapy for COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. Larger and longer-term CCP studies are also necessary to evaluate their immunomodulatory effects in COVID-19 patients. M a n u s c r i p t M a n u s c r i p t",
