            "text": "Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 \u03bcm. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex \u00ae test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The transmission of SARs-CoV-2 can occur by contact or droplets released from infected persons when coughing, talking, and sneezing [2] . Airborne transmission might occur during aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation [3] . Therefore, health care personnel (HCP), especially frontline workers, should be properly protected with appropriate equipment. A filtering facepiece and N95 respirators are used as high-performance filtering masks to protect staff against both droplets and aerosols [4] . To avoid cross contamination, these devices are designed to be disposable after a single use [5] . Consequently, the consumption of FFP masks has been overwhelmed, and a supply shortage for HCP has already been reported in many countries [6] .",

            "text": "The silicone elastometric mask is made using Silibione MM Series 71791 U silicone (Bluestar silicones, Shanghai, China), which are elastomers comprising of polymethyl vinyl siloxane gums and silica. In this particular series, these silicone rubbers are cured after the addition of a vulcanizing agent (chosen as a function of the production process). The heat cure is done after the addition of an organic peroxide compound and post-curing at 200\u02daC after vulcanization. This series includes four products that differ by their hardness once cured: 40, 50, 60, and 70 types. Once processed, the Silibione MM series 71791 U are intended for food contact and biomedical applications. The advantages of the Silibione MM series 71791 U include easy processing, highly transparent, and excellent mechanical properties (including high tear strength and a good compromise between tear strength and compression set). The Silibione MM series 71791 U is also very resistant to oxidizing agents for all sterilization modes, and is chemically inert. Moreover, samples of the silicone MM series have been subjected to migration heats in accordance with European and American regulations (https://silicones.elkem.com/EN/our_offer/ Product/90000717/_/SILBIONE-MM-71791-60-U). The masks are made in three sizes: small, medium, and large. We assembled the silicone with a HEPA filter (CareStar 1 electrostatic filter), which is normally used together with a ventilator to filter bacteria and viruses from airborne transmission (Fig 2) . The efficiency of the silicone mask is based on the efficiency of the air filter, which is considered a high-performing electrostatic filtration medium (Fig 3) .",

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the fitting characteristic of our newly invented silicone elastometric respirator and the performance against 30-\u03bcm particles using NaCl aerosols. The study was conducted to achieve two specific research objectives: (1) to investigate the fit characteristics of the novel silicone mask and whether the strap adjustment can help reduce the face-seal leakage; and (2) to determine the level of performance by measuring the inward leakage of the generated aerosols with a new filter and a used filter (for up to 24 h).",

Each subject was given a taste-threshold screening test prior to each fit test to ensure that he or she could taste. This process was done without the subject wearing a respirator. Inject ten (10) squeezes of the test solution aerosol into the hood through the hole in front of the enclosure and ask the subject if he can detect the bitter taste of Bitrex. If the subject does not detect bitter taste, inject an additional ten squeezes into the hood. If the subject still does not detect bitter taste, inject an additional ten squeezes, for a total of 30 squeezes. If 30 squeezes were inadequate to elicit a response from the subject, this subject could not be fit tested with the Bitrex test. If the subject could detect bitter taste, the number of squeezes required to produce a taste response should be noted, i.e., 10, 20 or 30 squeezes, even if the subject tasted the Bitrex on a number of squeezes other than multiples of ten.",

Particle penetration was carried out in the chamber using a NaCl aerosol generated from a 2% solution applied to a nebulizer, as specified by NIOSH to certify N95 FFRs (42 CFR 84.181). The environmental conditions during both particle penetration tests (initial and final) were maintained at 38\u02daC and 85% relative humidity. The test used two light-scattering laser photometers simultaneously to measure the upstream and downstream aerosol concentration levels at a constant flow that is reported with the TSI model 4045 flow meter. The particle penetration value is determined from the ratio of these two readings. A highly accurate electronic pressure transducer determines the filter resistance. Pressure transducer and photometer readings are taken between every test to determine the new pressure offset and photometer background values. Fig 4 provides a schematic of the experimental set-up that was used to measure BR through the respirator. First, an initial NaCl aerosol penetration test was performed following NIOSH certification protocol (42 CFR 84.181). Next, a BR test was performed.",

Adjustable head straps then allow a better-customized seal because they can be tightened to better secure the respirators. At first, three different sizes of the face pieces were produced. The majority of our participants used medium sizes. It should be noted that fit-testing is just one factor to determine the level of protection provided by a respirator. Other tests, such as filter penetration, should also be done. According to the specification of the electrostatic filter (CareStar or SafeStar), the estimated filtration efficiency should be more than 99% after testing with the SIBATA machine. The new filter had the filtration efficiency of more than 99%. We then evaluated the filters after use (1 to 24 h) since the filter efficacy might be hampered by humidity and the formation of a biofilm layer over the filter surface. The test protocol that we adapted measures the percent leakage through the filters by counting the sodium chloride generated aerosols. The percent of leakage was less than 1%. Thus, we can confirm that the efficiency of our new respirators was compatible with the N99 type of respirator and can be used at least up to 24 h before changing the filter.",

The silicone mask still has some drawbacks, such as the hardness of the material, that is comfortable for the wearer. Those who wear eyeglasses might have difficulty placing his/her eyeglasses on the bridge of the silicone mask. The levels of protection afforded by the respiratory protective devices in this study might not be representative of all respirator wearers, who might have different facial size distributions than those of the subjects in this study. The filters that we tested had limited use times (up to 24 h), while their efficiency remained excellent. Further tests should be performed for a filter that has been used for more than 24 h. The filtration test was designed with the equipment available in the unit based on the urgency to search for alternative protective devices. We found that 42.6% of the wearers reported some discomfort due to the haziness and fog inside the silicone mask, which was caused by the condensation of the humidity inside the mask. The hydrophobicity of the silicone, which protects water and droplets to penetrate, promoted the discomfort. There were also some hearing problems while wearing the silicone mask as found in the Powered Air Purifying Respirator, PAPR) since the mask decreases the vibration of noise causing communication errors.",

However, this is the first version of our masks, and further modifications are needed to improve user friendliness and provide adequate protection.
