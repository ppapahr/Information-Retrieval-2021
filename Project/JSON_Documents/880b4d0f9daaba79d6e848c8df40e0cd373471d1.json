First, use of a BSL-3 ventilation system is the prerequisite for SARS autopsies. Second, because PPE is the first barrier of protection, we invested in the maximum protection available, including gas masks, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves. Because the use of oscillating saws, spray, and aspirators hoses may generate infectious aerosols, and because dissection of lungs can also create aerosols and droplets [8, 9] , respiratory protection for SARS autopsies is especially important. The combined filter system of the gas masks used in our facility provided the highest level of protection available to the investigators. Although the CDC recommended that N-100 particulate respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with HEPA filters should be used if aerosols may be generated [6, 21] , PAPRs were not available in Beijing during the SARS outbreak; thus, the gas mask became the practical choice for use in our facility. However, we noticed that the gas masks made the investigators feel uncomfortable. Therefore, PAPRs would be the better choice in the future. The 3 layers of gloves made the investigators work more cumbersome and prone to mistakes, but this was nevertheless necessary for secure protection. Third, a 3-step procedure for decontamination of PPE was strictly followed. This was indispensable for the safety of the investigators, laboratory, and environment. Last but not least, we strictly adhered to administration controls, including rigorous biosafety training, supervision, and operational procedures. Our experiences suggest that monitoring personal behaviors, together with teaching of biosafety and correct attitudes to those involved in the autopsies, best ensure the safety of autopsy performance. It is noteworthy that safety administration may be neglected until something goes wrong. For example, 2 SARS cases that appeared at the end of 2003 were laboratory acquired [22, 23] . The small SARS outbreak in late March and mid-April 2004 in China also originated from contamination of 2 researchers at the National Institute of Virology in China's Center for Disease Control [24] . These incidences indicated that safety precautions and the personal attitudes of staff members are what really counts, provided that stringent engineering and PPE standards are applied.
