Despite relative subjectivity and lack of evidence that personal statements correlate with future success or clinical performance, they are used in the residency application process to better determine a medical student's \"fit\" for a program. 1, 2 The freeform nature of the personal statement allows students to advocate for themselves in their own voice, thereby allowing insight into the personality, interests, morals, and values of each individual applicant not otherwise captured in the rest of the residency application. As USMLE Step 1 scores move to pass/fail grading and the potential implications of COVID-19 for future residency application cycles materialize, the personal statement may become more prominent in the decision making process.",

The majority of these studies have found differences between men and women's writing that play into gender stereotypes. [6] [7] [8] [9] Previously, we found that letter of recommendations written for male urology residency applicants were written in a more authentic tone, and reference themes of drive, power and work more often than letters written for female applicants. 6 However, gender-based differences in personal statements of applicants to urology residency programs have not been studied.",

Through comprehensive linguistic analysis of personal statements of urology residency applicants, we sought to gain insight into gender-based differences through applicant's personal statements, identifying writing characteristics unique to urology applicants and highlighting similarities and differences between male and female authors. We hypothesize that there are linguistic differences between personal statements written by male and female residency applicants that follow gender stereotypes which in turn may highlight the continued gender disparities within the field of urology.",

This suggests that values of maledominated specialties encourage applicants, regardless of gender, to express more agency overall. Conversely, residents entering pediatrics, a female-dominated specialty, showed equal amounts of communal language used by male and female applicants, again suggesting that personal statement language is partially dictated by the applicant's perception of specialty-specific values of behavior and speech. 9 It must also be noted that due to the gender disparity found within urology and other male-dominated medical fields, a large majority of faculty reviewers and program directors are male, which may impact how personal statements are read and received.",

Lower ranked individuals use more first-person singular pronouns such as \"I\" and \"me\" whereas higher ranked individuals use more first-person plural pronouns such as \"we\" and \"us.\" 20 This may indicate that male medical students applying into urology perceive themselves to be of a higher social rank within the medico-social hierarchy found in healthcare and urology than female students. This may also be reflected in the increased usage of anxietyrelated words by female urology applicants as compared to men. Literature on the role of gender in medical school education suggests that implicit gender bias influences the acculturation and sense of self differently between male and female students that in turn reflects on their sense of acceptance in their chosen professional community. 21, 22 Our study found that applicants to urology residency wrote their personal statements in a highly analytical and authentic style with positive emotional tone. Notably, there was a diminished clout score for all personal statements written by medical students applying into urology, implying a decreased sense of confidence and expertise. The average clout score was 36 (range 0-100), a significantly lower score than that of other summary categories of authenticity, emotional tone and analytical processes which were higher than average scores when compared to various types of writing. 19 This finding seems understandable in that a tentative tone would seem natural when a relatively inexperienced medical student is appealing to a group of more experienced physicians.",

However, this finding is not consistent across medical specialties. [7] [8] [9] Comparatively, clout scores were above average and approximately 15% higher among pediatric residency applicants. 9 The reasons for decreased clout in the writing of urology applicants is unclear. With the exception of expressive writing (categorized as emotional writing) which has a similarly low clout score (37, range 0-100), various texts such as novels, natural speech, and newspapers show high levels of clout. 19 Perhaps the perception that the urology residency match is highly competitive leads applicants to write more tentatively and emotionally. Lower clout scores could also reflect insecurity due to decreased fieldspecific exposure that some urology applicants may have during medical school as compared to other specialty applicants. 23 Despite being the first manuscript to explore linguistic differences in personal statements among urology applicants, our manuscript must be viewed in the context of several limitations. While LIWC software has been validated for context reliability, there still remains a possibility that the tone and authorial intent could be misinterpreted if full context was considered. For example, there are words that have a different meaning in medicine as compared to lay language, which may not be accurately captured using LIWC. Secondly, while the study of linguistic analysis is growing, there remains a lack of studies evaluating personal statements for many medical specialties. Thus, we are unable with full certainty to compare and contrast the personal statements from urology residency applicants to those of other specialties. Additionally, the personal statements used were collected from the applicants to a single urology residency training program.",

As one example, increased female mentorship would provide reassurance to female urology applicants in the face of elevated male-to-female ratios throughout urology. Our findings emphasize the importance and value that female applicants place on female gender-concordant experiences, as female applicants showed a significant increase in the number of female references in their personal statements as compared to males. While there is an increasing number of female urologists in academic and fellowship trained subspecialties, women hold a disproportionately small number of department chair, vice chair, and educational directorship positions. 25, 26 There is a vital need for women to ascend to leadership positions in order to improve female mentorship within the field.",

Residents who matched at the University of North Carolina urology residency during the studied application year were excluded in an effort to reduce risk of identification of the author. Descriptive data of applicants were manually extracted from their residency applications, including age, race, gender, number of gap years between medical school and residency, USMLE Step 1 score, number of research projects reported, match outcome, and medical school rank. Medical school rank was determined by examining the U.S. News & World Report Best Medical School Research rankings reported during the 2016-2017 year.",
