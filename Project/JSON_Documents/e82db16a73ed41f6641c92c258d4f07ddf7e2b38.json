COVID-19 is now an important issue in Japanese radiotherapy departments. According to the DIRAC database, Japan has 800 radiotherapy centers, the third largest number in the world [7] . Chinese researchers report that cancer patients and cancer survivors are at increased risk of severe events 3 associated with COVID-19 compared to noncancer patients [8] . Additionally, cancer patients might have more chance to exposed to SARS-CoV-2 because they are supposed to receive radiotherapy every weekday for multiple weeks. For these patients, treatment would have to be discontinued for several weeks if they were to contract COVID-19, potentially leading to inferior treatment outcomes [9] . Therefore, COVID-19 prevention measures in radiotherapy departments are urgently needed to protect patients.",

Proper hand hygiene was practiced at some but not all of the institutions, with 54.3% of the respondents reporting that patients 5 performed hand hygiene, 96.2% reporting that staff who had contact with patients performed hand hygiene, and 86.4% reporting that staff who did not have contact with patients performed hand hygiene. Only 50.5% of respondents indicated that all patients wore masks; 96.2% reported that all staff who had direct contact with patients wore masks, and 85.3% reported that all staff who had no direct contact with patients wore masks. Only 8.1% of the respondents reported that they used PPE in their radiotherapy practice. The number of respondents indicated that the radiotherapy clinic was ventilated was 58.7% for the examination room, 59.8% for the patient waiting room, 42.9% for the operation room, 49.5% for the staff room, and 20.7% for the treatment room. In addition, 63.0% of the respondents indicated that proper social distancing was maintained between patients, while fewer respondents reported such between staff at work (32.6%) or while on breaks (47.3%). These results indicated that there were differences in IPC measures for COVID-19 between radiotherapy departments. In addition, at this time, it was found that COVID-19 occurred in only one institution, and that COVID-19 had little impact on radiotherapy practice in Japan as a whole. Although the number of COVID-19 in Japan is relatively low compared to other countries, the impact of COVID-19 on radiotherapy should continue to be closely monitored.",

This version of the questionnaire contained 28 questions. One question was added, and the questionnaire then was sent to JASTRO members throughout Japan via JASTRO-gram on April 16, 2020, when the areas under declaration of state of emergency were expanded to all 47 prefectures in Japan. We also asked the respondents to revise their responses if their COVID-19 measures had changed or if there was an infection outbreak in their institutions. The aggregated results were analyzed using the autoanalysis function of Google Forms and disclosed immediately to respondents. All questionnaire results were downloaded from the website on April 23, 2020 for our research.",
