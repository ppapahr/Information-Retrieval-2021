There is a wide variety of face masks available on the market for various applications, but they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal passage and/or mouth. In this paper, we present a new \"active mask\" paradigm, in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a commercial particulate matter (PM) sensor, and if necessary activates a piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles, thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control system and manually control the mist generator if necessary. Experimental results from a functional prototype demonstrate significant reduction in airborne PM counts near the mask when the active protection system is enabled.",

This novel virus has brought everyone's lives to a standstill and the economy to its knees. Although most people are actively following social distancing norms, proper hygiene, and other preventive measures, it is likely that normal day-to-day life will continue to be affected until an effective vaccine is developed. To mitigate this situation and return to some semblance of normalcy, we believe there is a need for preventive methods that actively combat the virus instead of providing passive protection (e.g., physical barriers). Implementing such improved methods requires smart devices that can detect, quantify, and actively eradicate viruses and other pathogens.",

By contrast, active protection devices can actively attack and destroy pathogens near vulnerable parts of the body (e.g., the nose and mouth). Here we consider closed-loop active or \"smart\" masks for use in places where potentially virus-laden respiratory droplets (typically 0.1-10 \u00b5m in diameter) are most likely to be transmitted; examples include bathrooms, doctor's offices, daycare centers, and public transportation. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the proposed smart mask architecture. A detailed comparison of existing masks with the proposed smart mask is shown in Table I . The table shows that the proposed system detects airborne droplets (potentially containing viruses for COVID-19, influenza, measles, or other diseases) and limits their spread via an appropriate situation-aware mitigation strategy. The chosen strategy should be \"smart\", i.e., adaptive based on sensor outputs that provide information on concentration, size distribution, and other properties of the droplets. In our initial implementation, mitigation is provided by a cold mist generator that loads the droplets (thus making them quickly fall to the ground), and adaptation is provided by algorithms running on an on-board controller that adjust the spray angle, intensity, and duration of the generator based on sensor data. Such active closed-loop protection can remove viruses (and other pathogens) from the air before they infect others, thereby reducing the need for periodic disinfection of the area, while providing increased protection to the wearer.",

These droplets may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s, and reach distances up to 8 meters ( Fig. 2(b) ). By contrast, a single cough may produce up to 3, 000 droplet nuclei, and similar numbers are typically recorded after talking for five minutes. Air flows can carry infectious droplets long distances; such flows occur even during the most innocuous daily activities, such as walking or opening doors.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is 100 nm in diameter, and can remain suspended within droplets > 0.2 \u00b5m in size. Droplets > 5 \u00b5m fall to the ground quickly, while very small droplets evaporate [4] and aerosolize in a few seconds to droplet nuclei \u223c1 \u00b5m in size [5] . Fortunately, most masks can filter out droplets of this size: many materials have \u2265 96% filtration efficacy for particles > 0.3 \u00b5m, including 600 TPI (threads per inch) cotton, cotton quilts, and cotton layered with chiffon, silk, or flannel [6] , [7] . Thus, the most important requirement for the proposed smart mask is to eliminate the small (but potentially significant) fraction of virus-laden droplets that are < 0.3 \u00b5m in size. These small droplets are removed by creating an air-flow pattern close to the mask through spraying a mist. It blows the droplets away from the wearer and also \"loads\" them (i.e., increases their mass and size), thus causing them to quickly fall to the ground (Fig. 2(c) ).",

The experimental setup for testing the functional prototype uses a humidifier to replicate aerosol-sized droplets generated during daily activities like talking, coughing, and sneezing. The humidifier (Fig. 4(h) ) produces mist droplets in the 0.3-2.5 \u00b5m range. Since standard face masks filter out most large droplets (as mentioned earlier) [6] , [7] , we check the smart mask's performance against droplets of size < 0.3 \u00b5m. We use two PM sensors (Sensirion SPS30, see Fig. 4 (g)): one on the smart mask (which is placed at a height of \u223c1.6 m), and the other on the ground (Fig. 4(f) ). The use of two sensors allows us to quantify both predicted effects of PM loading by the mitigation spray: i) reduction in PM count near the mask, and ii) increase in PM count on the ground (due to the rapid falling of loaded particles). Note that the PM sensor on the ground is not part of the mask, and only used during testing. The chosen PM sensor is based on laser scattering and has built-in \"contamination resistance\" feature in which artificial air flow (created using a small built-in fan) is used to drive deposited particles out of the sensor. Due to the placement of the exhaust vent, this air flow interferes with the incoming air. To reduce this effect, we provided a guided path for the exhaust as shown in Fig. 4(g) .",

Next, we performed two calibration experiments. First, the humidifier was turned ON, which imitates droplets produced by human actions, for 15 sec with the mitigation module turned OFF. The aerosols were then allowed to settle for 160 sec, with both PM sensors recording their local number and mass concentrations. Second, the same experiment was repeated, but with the smart mask's mitigation module turned ON under normal conditions i.e., with the humidifier turned OFF. Finally, the effectiveness of the smart mask was verified, as follows. The humidifier was turned ON for 15 sec, and the smart mask activated for 15 sec once its sensor detects a significant local change in PM concentration. The outputs of both PM sensors were then monitored until all aerosols settle out (\u223c160 sec). The results of these experiments are analyzed in the next section. Clearly, the mitigation module (mist generator) significantly reduces the local PM number within this critical size range -simple analysis suggests a time-averaged reduction of \u223c20%. Moreover, the PM count with the mitigation module ON is artificially increased due to the aerosols generated by the module itself ( Fig. 5(b) ). Once this self-interference term is subtracted, the time-averaged reduction in PM count due to the mask becomes even more significant - Fig. 5 (c) suggests \u223c40%.",

Figs. 5(e) and (f) compare the time-averaged mass and number concentrations with the mask ON and OFF for both internal (on the mask) and external (on the ground) PM sensors. The data shows that the mass concentrations measured by the external sensor in the 0.3-1.0 \u00b5m and 1.0-2.5 \u00b5m ranges increase by \u223c63% and \u223c60%, respectively, when the mask is turned ON.

We have presented the system design, and using a functional prototype of the mask, also demonstrated the major operational characteristics. Various levels of smartness can be incorporated into the proposed system to control the time, duration, and intensity of mitigation based on awareness of the location (e.g., hospitals, quarantined zones, or care centers with infected patients), ambient conditions (e.g., humidity and air temperature, human occupancy), and overall health of the user (e.g., age, pre-existing conditions, etc.). The proposed mask can also be extended to protect against pollutants, dust particles, and pollen, e.g., for vulnerable populations with pollen and/or dust allergies. It can also be extended to other usage scenarios, e.g., military personnel exposed to harmful airborne particles; dentists performing dental procedures; and day-care or elementary schools where social distancing is hard to maintain. While more testing and evaluation is needed to fully establish the merits of the smart mask and identify remaining design challenges and associated trade-offs, the initial results are highly promising. The proposed defense can be applied to existing masks as an add-on reusable assembly, as well as to new mask designs as demonstrated here. It also has the potential to completely replace traditional masks for specific applications. Our future studies will focus on these topics.",
