We can make at-risk patients we triage, and patients who access our practice websites, aware of the Mouth Cancer Foundation symptom checker (www.mouthcancerfoundation. org). 4 Video consultation also offers a solution and practice websites and social media threads can include oral health advice. National Smile Month started on 18 May offering digital engagement (www. nationalsmilemonth.org/). Mouth Cancer Action Month is in November; the infamous #BlueLipSelfie might help raise awareness (www.bluelipselfie.co.uk/). We can continue to signpost smoking cessation advice online too -perhaps this new remote practice offers an opportunity to support patients who are interested in quitting smoking and the Smokefree service allows patient to access advice and support from experts: quitnow. smokefree.nhs.uk/. We need to remember those patients who have previously received a cancer diagnosis who would usually be accessing our care to receive support and preventive dental care. Many charities such as The Throat Cancer Foundation and The Mouth Cancer Foundation are continuing to provide support to affected patients (www.throatcancerfoundation.org, mouthcancerfoundation.org/).",

Furthermore, many patients who undergo resection of oral cancer require post-operative intensive treatment unit (ITU) beds. 2 With approximately 8,000 more hospital deaths to date in 2020 than is routine, elective surgery poses stress on a healthcare system already experiencing unprecedented pressures in ITU, and perhaps, a redeployed staff. 3",

Many last treated a patient in early March, and the next time they are likely to treat a patient is in September as a Dental Foundation Trainee (DFT), after almost seven months of clinical inactivity. All dental professionals returning to work after this current pandemic will feel such an effect but for those transitioning from dental school to DFT and learning about working in primary care for the first time this will be a very steep challenge. Despite the challenging time the world and the dental profession faces, I have been very impressed by how we have adapted and continued to deliver education. This has allowed dental undergraduates to continue receiving lectures and case-based teaching through webinars. Many dental schools have also taken the decision to deliver finals exams",

Following orthodontic triage, most emergencies are being managed with telephone advice and direction towards the British Orthodontic Society website which has excellent advice and video tutorials on home repairs. 1 In the medium term there is concern with regards to the oral health of orthodontic patients currently in active treatment. Orthodontic treatment increases the patient's risk of developing decalcification, caries and gingivitis. However, with excellent oral hygiene and dietary control of sugar intake, these risks are reduced. Without regular reinforcement and review, patient motivation and compliance may be compromised with detrimental effects. For some patients it may be prudent to discontinue orthodontic treatment as a result. 2 Additionally, some patients may choose to terminate treatment due to the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19.",
