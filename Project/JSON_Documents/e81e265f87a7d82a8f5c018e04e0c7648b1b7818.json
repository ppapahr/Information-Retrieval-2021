            "text": "Over the last decade, online education has become a viable and major component of higher education in many fields including business administration and management, psychology, criminal justice, etc. On the other hand, online education is not yet widespread throughout all engineering disciplines [1] but it is limited to few carefully selected courses in each engineering discipline or mainly at the master's and postgraduate levels [7] . Hands-on training to work with equipment, instruments and materials in controlled laboratory setting is an inherent and necessary aspect of a successful engineering education. However, addressing this essential aspect within a fully online teaching platform is challenging. Moreover, many students prefer to learn difficult concepts face-to-face [8] and believe that the online education might not be the best choice for a deep level of learning [9] . Converting a course from conventional faceto-face to online format is also time consuming and requires the instructor's familiarity with (or willingness to learn about) online learning or instructional tools including the learning management system (LMS). Another issue is the difficulty of designing fair and yet rigorous online assessments to minimize cheating and plagiarism [10] . A successful engineering education requires creating and maintaining a reliable and robust infrastructure that supports both faculty and students [7, 11] .",

Also, more than half of our students are lowincome or first-generation college students. As a result, CSULB is recognized as a minority serving institution: namely Hispanic, Asian American, Native American, and Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. Due to COVID-19, majority of educational programs in CSULB were converted to fully online format within a transitional period of 10 days in March 2020. This included all the programs offered by the College of Engineering (COE) that consists of six departments, with more than 250 faculty and 5000 students. The unprecedented circumstances of global pandemic enforced the swift conversion of the mode of instruction. Hence, the teaching materials and assessment methods had to be developed \"on the fly\". Both our students and faculty encountered various challenges during the online instruction in Spring 2020. By the end of the semester in May 2020, CSULB announced that Fall 2020 semester was going to be in the alternative mode of instructions, as well. Thus, the majority of the courses were scheduled to be offered in synchronous online format (where faculty and students are expected to attend the live online sessions). Few classes, where the face-to-face component is considered essential to meet the learning outcomes of the course and therefore could not be conducted fully online, (e.g. laboratories and senior design capstone projects) were exempted and offered in hybrid/blended format.",

Sloan's online learning consortium has defined the five pillars of high-quality online education as: learning effectiveness, student satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, access, scale and cost [1] . Given these factors, our team decided to take a systematic approach for improvement of the instruction by first conducting faculty and student surveys and then proposing interventions to address the identified issues. This paper presents the results of our surveys and provides a summary of proposed solutions. Sharing these results with other educators in engineering field can facilitate a more robust continuity of education during ongoing pandemic. It can also aid with overall improvement of online engineering education in the post-pandemic era especially for those universities with a large percentage of minority and first-generation/lowincome students.",

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of survey participants among various departments within the COE (question #1 on both surveys). We observe that all departments have relatively similar representations in terms of percentage of faculty and student participants (9% BME, 5-10% CHE, 15-23% CECEM, 19-22% CECS, 18-22% EE, and 21-26% MAE). These percentages are consistent with the size of our departments in terms of number of faculty and students. This observation shows that our survey sample population could be a good representative of the general COE populations in terms of existing majors. Fig. 2 shows the percentages of survey respondents who indicated various logistical challenges they had during the online instruction period of Spring 2020 (question #2 on the faculty survey and question #3 on the student survey). Close to 15% of the faculty had issues with software license or no access to personal computer/tablet. About 20% of the faculty did not have access to microphone/headset or printer/scanner. 23% of faculty had no reliable internet connection, while 32% had no access to webcam or camera for the online instruction. Finally, 47% of the faculty indicated that they had no access or technical difficulties with online writing tools. Among the student respondents, 1% had no access to any computer/tablet, while close to 5% had only access to a shared computer at home. 3% had no internet connection, while 26% had issues with reliability of their internet. 28% indicated having issues with software access, while 26% had no printer/scanner at home. Fig. 3 summarizes the prevalence of challenges students had with online instruction during Spring 2020 (questions # 3-6 on the student survey). About 70% of students indicated difficulty in maintaining their focus or experiencing Zoom fatigue after attending multiple online sessions. 55% of students felt social disconnection from their classmates/peers, while 64% did not feel engaged during the online classes. 60% of the students felt there was a lack of clear guidance or communication from the instructors. Also, a quarter of students had issues with online submission of assignments and exams, mainly due to the lack of access to printer/scanner as we learned from students' optional comments. About 40% of students had technical difficulty and ineptness issues with using or navigating through Zoom or BB. 48% of the students experienced time management issues during the online exams. In optional comments, some students expressed their frustration with not being able to go back to previous questions (a BB feature for the instructors to limit cheating). 23% of the students indicated that the unavailability of the instructor during the online exam (in contrast to inperson exam) caused challenges.",

            "text": "Our survey also indicated that more than 50% of our students did not have access to a private or even quiet space to attend the online classes or to study. 55% of students also lacked motivation to study (question #3 on the student survey). The optional comments shed further light onto the lack of motivation. The uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and loss of peer interaction/support were identified as the major contributing factors. Finally, 24% of the students rated their overall experience of online instruction (question #8 on the student survey) as satisfying, 37% found it dissatisfying while the rest (39%) were neutral. Table 1 shows the prevalence of various methods that the faculty used to assess students' learning during the online instruction of Spring 2020. Semi-online refers to an exam where students solve the assigned problems on a paper, then scan and upload their solutions. Asynchronous exam refers to a take-home exam while a synchronous exam is the one conducted during the scheduled class or exam time. The survey allowed respondents to choose more than one assessment method per question (because faculty might have taught multiple classes and held more than one exam during the semester), thus the sum of the percentages would not equal to 100. We observe that the fully online exams such as the BB quizzes were used by 63% of the faculty. BB quizzes provides the faculty with the convenient option of randomizing the order and/or the parameter values of the questions. The instructor can also limit the view to one question per page for students and prevent them from going back to previous questions. The effectiveness of these options in limiting cheating/ plagiarism-and consequently the reduced need for further proctoring -might have contributed to the high popularity of this assessment method among the faculty. The remaining assessment methods in the decreasing order of their prevalence were project/term paper (50%), semi-online synchronous exam (40%), oral presentation/exam (33%), and semi-online asynchronous exam (28%). Our survey also revealed that 70% of the faculty used the open-book/open-note exam while 33% tried closed-book/closed note exams. The preference of open-book/open-note exam among faculty could be also justified by the decreased need for proctoring tools. In fact, our data (faculty survey question #7) revealed that among those faculty who employed open-book/open-note exam, only 27% used Zoom camera and microphone for proctoring of the exam. 21% used lockdown browsers (e.g. respondus), while 61% did not have any proctoring. However, when the exams were closed-book/closed-note, 56% of the faculty decided to proctor the exam using Zoom camera and microphone, 18% chose to use the lockdown browsers and 35% did not proctor. We also evaluated the association of cheating/plagiarism with various assessment methods by calculating the Pearson correlation of faculty's assessment methods with their trichotomized perception of online cheating (less cheating, the same, more cheating) relative to that of face-to-face (faculty survey question #8). The results revealed no statistically significant correlation between cheating and assessment methods except for the following: Fully online exam (correlation= -0.40, p-value<0.0001), Semi-online asynchronous exam (correlation= 0.26, p-value=0.005), Open-book/Closed-book (correlation= -0.30, p-value=0.002). This data analysis shows that while semi-online asynchronous exams were associated with an increase in the perceived cheating, a fully online or open-book/open-note exams had an association with a decrease in instructor's perception of cheating.",

These results are consistent with those reported in a recent study conducted at Biomedical and Chemical Engineering departments of a Hispanic-serving institution [13] . While the percentage of our students who had issues with lack of motivation or private space seemed to be higher, both studies highlight the necessity of providing more socio-emotional support for students during the difficult times of pandemic. Despite some similarities, there are several differences between our study and [13] that need to be pointed out: while their study is based on a qualitative surveying from 170 students within two Engineering departments, our study uses qualitative and quantitative surveying from 627 students and 110 faculty from six Engineering departments. So, our study has a larger cohort size of students from more engineering disciplines. Furthermore, our survey questions were qualitative and quantitative. In addition to students, we also included another important education stakeholder (faculty) in our survey.

Lack of peer-support during the online instruction in the COVID-19 era negatively affects the motivation and learning outcomes of the students. However, the remaining raised issues could be addressed in part by employing appropriate teaching techniques by faculty as follows: breaking down a long lecture into shorter segments with more frequent breaks, encouraging group discussion among students, making themselves available during the exams, providing students with a clear roadmap for the online course, making the recordings of the live lectures available after the lecture is over. The latest would help struggling students to learn at their own pace [13] . To assist with the time management issue, faculty can design practice exams to allow students to familiarize themselves with the questions' setup and adapt with the exam's style before the actual exam.",

Especially, in the absence of traditional in-class whiteboard, many faculty members indicated lacking an online writing tool.

Some of our faculty have used camera/microphone to proctor exams during Spring 2020. However, as our student survey indicated, the use of camera/microphone can raise equity concerns (for those who do not have access to camera and cannot afford it) and privacy concern (for monitoring students' private space). To address these valid concerns, faculty are advised to choose alternative methods for reducing cheating during online exams. Randomizing the exam questions by shuffling both the problem statements and the multiple choices or randomly selecting a subset of questions in a question library with individualized input variables could be practical solutions. Fortunately, most LMS provide these options. However, although 99% of postsecondary US institutions have an LMS in use, only approximately half of faculty at those institutions have been using it on a regular basis [21] . As a result, many faculty members are not familiar with the basic or advances features of their LMS or other tools for effective online instruction. Our survey result confirmed this observation. In fact, our faculty identified a broad range of topics related to BB or other online teaching tools that they felt the need to enhance their skills in. Institutions could address this issue by organizing training workshops, webinars, shortcourses, and discussion panels for their faculty to enhance their online teaching skills. At CSULB, stipends were offered in summer 2020 to further incentivize faculty participation in these professional development programs.",
