Complementarity of the 5 -end of a primer to the PCR template is not so critical as for the 3 -end, and it is known that longer primers at the 5 -end (such as 30 nt or longer) do not improve specificity of PCR primers. The 5 -end of a primer also allows an addition of a tagging sequence. Complete binding between primers and template is not required at the 5 -end. However, the 3 -end of a primer is different from the 5 -end. Thermostable DNA polymerase starts attaching nucleotides from the 3 -end of a primer during the extension step, and it requires complete annealing of the 3 -end of a primer to a template. Incomplete binding at the 3 -end results in inefficient PCR or sometimes no PCR products. Alternatively, it is possible that too stable annealing of a primer at the 3 -end to a template allows generation of PCR product without complete binding between the rest of primer and template, and tolerance in incomplete binding may amplify unexpected PCR product by primer binding to other templates or different regions in a target template. Thus, the 3 -end of a primer is important in PCR primer design for successful PCR experiments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Several kinds of recommendations for the 3 -end of a primer can be found in the literature.

Further studies of the 3 -end were necessary for primer design. It is difficult to perform comprehensive testing of the effects of all 3 -end triplet types in actual PCR experiments. There are 64 triplet types and the amplifying region of the template is different for every primer for 3 -end triplet testing. The optimized PCR conditions may differ for each primer pairs because primer pairs and amplifying regions of a template differ. In this case, PCR results are confounded with many critical factors: 3 -end triplets, primer and template sequences, and PCR conditions. Thus, another approach was taken to examine the frequencies of the 3 -end triplets in successful PCR experiments with a variety of templates and under a variety of conditions. Experimental conditions and primer sequences in successful PCR experiments have been deposited in and are available through the VirOligo database (7).

In the VirOligo database, WSS (19.0%; six of top 11) and SWS (18.0%; four of top 11) were the two most common kinds of 3 -end triplets.

It should be noted that TTS triplets were also preferred (top 8th and 14th), and all top 16 triplets were NNS at the 3 -end (N stands for any of the four nucleotides). Thus, primers should be designed to have SWS, WSS, or TTS as the 3 -end triplet but no CG in the triplet. If such primers are not available, one should select primers with S at the 3 -end.

The favored triplets are 11 of 64 types (17%). Because there are two primers in a pair for PCR, the chance of getting both forward and reverse primers with the recommended triplets is 17% multiplied by itself, or as small as 3%. Fifty output pairs are expected to have at least one pair that matches the requirements if nothing interferes with 3 -end sequence. A larger primer output is better, but more lower ranked pairs appear in the output in such case, and low ranked pairs have undesirable properties in terms of G + C contents or T m of primers. In addition, it simply is not easy to handle very large numbers of primers. So, try to obtain about twice the default number. 3. When primers are obtained by a primer design program, the user needs to note that some primer search settings such as 3 -end \"GC clamp\" interfere with the 3 -end triplet selection. Such settings should be turned off. Otherwise, all 3 -ends in output primer set will have uniform triplets as a result of the search configuration. GC clamp has been used for point mutation detection by adding GC-rich sequences to 5 -end of PCR primer (11). When PCR products with G + C-rich 5 -end primers were differentiated mutated sequences from wide type, GC clamp helps avoiding complete denaturation of DNA strands during a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis process. GC clamp for point mutation detection is simply by adding it to the 5 -end of a primer, and it is essentially not a complementary sequence of the gene sequence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "In primer design programs, GC clamp means different from that for point mutation detection. G + C-rich sequence creates strong annealing of primers to the template. Thus, some primer design programs search for G +C-rich or stable region in a target template. Some of them look for GC clamp at the 5 -ends of primers (e.g., Primer Premier) as that of point mutation detection does at the 5 -end. On the contrary, some programs (e.g., Primer3) have a function to search G + C-rich region at the 3 -ends of primers. Although such function can be used for ensuring complete annealing of the 3 -end of a primer to the template, it interferes with the recommendations in this chapter. Please consult a manual for primer design program using and find out a type of \"GC clamp\" that the primer design program searches for. In case the program has the searching function for GC clamp at the 3 -end, such function should be turned off or the number of GC clamp required should be set to zero. 4. Both Vector NTI Advance 9.1 and DS Gene 1.5 let the user decide on a 3 -end sequence to search for primer candidates. Because the recommendations described here consist of three types, SWS, WSS, and TTS, it is not possible to search all three types using this function in one primer search session. The user may try one triplet type at a time using such 3 -end restriction function, but the user should note that a better primer pair might be a forward primer with SWS type and a reverse primer with WSS type. Thus, such functions are not easy to apply for the present 3 -end recommendations, but it may be worth trying to find \"S\" at the 3 -end as all top 16 triplets contain \"S\" at the 3 -end.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Notes"}, {"text": "The following are the steps for finding \"S\" at the 3 -end:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Notes"}, {"text": "\u2022 Case of Vector NTI Advance 9.1 In \"3 -end\" tab of \"find primer\" window of Vector NTI, click off A and T for first nucleotide and leave the rest for both sense and anti-sense primer 3 . \u2022 Case of DS Gene 1. 5 Use the default settings (\"S\" should be appeared in \"3 -dinucleotide\" field). 5 .
