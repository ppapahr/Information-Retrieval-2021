            "text": "During global pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 , crisis communication is indispensable in dispelling fears, uncertainty, and unifying individuals worldwide in a collective fight against health threats. Inadequate crisis communication can bring dire personal and economic consequences. Mounting research shows that seemingly endless newsfeeds related to COVID-19 infection and death rates could considerably increase the risk of mental health problems. Unfortunately, media reports that include infodemics regarding the influence of COVID-19 on mental health may be a source of the adverse psychological effects on individuals. Owing partially to insufficient crisis communication practices, media and news organizations across the globe have played minimal roles in battling COVID-19 infodemics. Common refrains include raging QAnon conspiracies, a false and misleading \"Chinese virus\" narrative, and the use of disinfectants to \"cure\" COVID-19. With the potential to deteriorate mental health, infodemics fueled by a kaleidoscopic range of misinformation can be dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research on how to improve crisis communication across media and news organization channels. This paper identifies ways that legacy media reports on COVID-19 and how social media-based infodemics can result in mental health concerns. This paper discusses possible crisis communication solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to mitigate the negative influences of COVID-19 related news on mental health. Emphasizing the need for global media entities to forge a fact-based, person-centered, and collaborative response to COVID-19 reporting, this paper encourages media resources to focus on the core issue of how to slow or stop COVID-19 transmission effectively.",

In addition to its unknown viral characteristics, a key contributor fueling the destructive power of COVID-19 is its unprecedented transmissibility [6] [7] [8] . COVID-19's ability to spread fast and far in a short period is rare, even among other pandemics [6] [7] [8] . This rapid pace of transmission, coupled with consequent spikes in infection and death, has caused a range of physical and psychological issues in individuals across the globe [9] . Challenging to identify or fully \"cure\", mental health services were facing numerous, but resource-constraining pandemics like COVID-19 have exacerbated these issues [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

COVID-19 has been a source of complex, multifaceted stress for many [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .

Not only diminishing the mental health and well-being of individuals, COVID-19 has also limited the services people can access; the rationing of medical resources during the COVID-19 pandemic has instigated a restructuring and repurposing across mental health institutions to deal with the pandemic [26] [27] [28] . Well-intentioned measures, such as lockdowns and social distancing, have further diminished access to mental health services [10] , with many providers forced to close; leaving people little to no access to on-site assistance [26] [27] [28] .",

Crisis communication refers to \"the collection, processing, and dissemination of information required to address a crisis situation\" [33] . Though many developments of the field of crisis communication occurred in the past decades (e.g., the situational crisis communication theory developed by Timothy Coombs in 1995), crisis communication has a long history and is often contributed to eminent public figures such as Caesar and Confucius [34] [35] [36] [37] . With the help of exemplar (e.g., Johnson & Johnson's effective management of the Cyanide-Laced Tylenol Capsules crisis), as well as inadequate crisis communication practices (e.g., the United States government's mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina), a growing body of work has acknowledged crisis communication's role in mitigate negative impacts of adverse events [38] [39] [40] . Therefore, to address this research gap, this paper aims to identify areas where legacy media reports on COVID-19 and social media-fueled infodemics can harm people's mental health. This paper outlines potential crisis communication solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to alleviate the mental health consequences of COVID-19 coverage.",
