An exponential function E(t) with a time-varying Growth Constant k(t) is used. E(t) closely approximates observed COVID-19 Daily Confirmed Cases with NRMSD's of 1 to 2%. An example of prediction of future cases is presented. The Effective Growth Rates of a discrete SIR model were estimated on the basis of k(t) for COVID-19 data for Germany, and were found to be consistent with those reported in a previous study (1). The proposed procedure, which involves less than ten basic algebraic, logarithm and exponentiation operations for each data point, is suitable for use in promoting interdisciplinary research, exchange and sharing of information.",

The two corresponding sequences of dates have the same two intervals of separation, 9 days and 8 days. The difference in absolute dates of 13 days (between 7-Mar and 20-Mar) can be attributed to delays involved in the time required to achieve the desired effectiveness of each intervention (e.g. 5 days), and time shift due to averaging and reporting (e.g. 8 days).",

In order to complete the parameter estimation, other consideration and assumptions can be made to propose a suitable A. For example, 1/A can be taken to be approximately 8 days (Removal Rate of A=0.125) for the Germany data in accordance with community-specific information provided in (1). In (1), 8 days was proposed to be the typical reporting/detection delay (before removal) caused by incubation, symptoms development and testing. If we assume that this delay of 8 days is the Infectious Period 1/A, then, using our previous numerical example, k=0.087 and A=1/8=0.125 would result in (e k(t) -1)=0.091 and B=0.216. It can be easily shown that applying B=0.216 and A=0.125 to Eq. 7 to calculate \uf044I(t) = I(t+1)-I(t) = [B(t)-A]I(t) recursively for 8 successive days, a doubling of I(t) would occur, corresponding to an Effective Reproduction Number of 2.",

A Death-to-Confirmed-Ratio can be approximated by the average ratio of Death to Confirmed Cases in the last ten days of the observation period. For communities who are in the early stage of the pandemic, a time delayed time series of Confirmed Cases C(t-\uf074), to correct for the time delay \uf074 between the date of Confirmation and date of Death, can be used in estimating the ratio. Projected daily Death Cases can then be calculated by multiplying the Projected Confirmed Cases E(t) in Fig. 1 by the estimated Death-to-Confirmed-Ratio.",
