            "text": "Fully inactivating SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019, is of key importance for interrupting virus transmission but is currently performed by using biologically or environmentally hazardous disinfectants. Herein, we report an eco-friendly and efficient electrochemical strategy for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 using in-situ formed nickel oxide hydroxide as anode catalyst and sodium carbonate as electrolyte. At a voltage of 5 V, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses can be rapidly inactivated with disinfection efficiency reaching 95% in only 30 s and 99.99% in 5 min. Mass spectrometry analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the reactive oxygen species generated on the anode can oxidize the peptide chains and induce cleavage of the peptide backbone of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, and thereby disables the virus. This strategy provides a sustainable and highly efficient approach for the disinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous aerosols and wastewater.",

Effective vaccines or drugs are still under development for the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection as of press time [2] [3] [4] [5] . Governments implement strict measures such as social isolation, wearing medical face mask, and timely disinfection to interrupt transmission of the infection and ensure public health [6] [7] [8] . However, the extremely high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 makes it a great challenge to prevent and control the pandemic. With daily increase of over 200,000 new infections worldwide recently, the COVID-19 patients in hospitals, communities, or public places produce enormous quantity of viruliferous aerosols and effluents with high infectious risk [9] [10] [11] [12] . More importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 was found to be able to survive in the wastewater for several days and thus the potential spread of the virus via sewage must not be neglected [13] [14] [15] . Such situations exert great pressure in the disinfection of wastewater and aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2.",

As strong oxidants, chlorine-containing disinfectants, e.g., liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, can damage the cell wall of microbes or viruses and intervene their metabolism, and consequently destroy them by oxidation [9, 19] . Despite its high effectiveness in disinfection, chlorination is still disadvantaged in generating toxic and carcinogenic by-products such as chloroform or haloacetic acids [18] . Under the increasingly serious situation of the pandemic, disinfection against the SARS-CoV-2 tends to be normalized in a long period of time. Relying on heavy use of chlorine-containing disinfectants results in great environmental pressure. Thus, it is of critical importance and urgent to develop green and sustainable methods for efficiently disinfecting SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous aerosols and wastewater without forming environmentally hazardous by-products.",

The skeleton of the original nickel foam is in metallic state (Fig. S1 online) , which ensures high conductivity of the electrodes. The pore size of the nickel foam electrode is of a few hundred micrometers (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2 online) , which is beneficial for increasing the number of active sites and promoting the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the electrochemical oxidation process. The double layer capacitance C dl of the nickel foam is 5.4 mF/cm 2 , which was measured by cyclic voltammograms in the potential range of 0.3-0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO with different scan rates (Fig. S3 online) . In open circuit case, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can hardly be inactivated in the 2 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution for 5 or 10 min (Fig. 1d, e) , as the 50% TCID 50 values for group incubation were similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 stock without any treatment. In contrast, the virus titer was significantly reduced along with the increase of applied voltage in the electrolysis. Within 5 min, more than 99% of the viruses can be inactivated at applied voltages up to 4 V and further increasing the applied voltage obviously enhances the inactivation efficiency (Fig. 1d) . At 5 V, the inactivation ratio reaches 95% in only 30 s and 99% in 2 min and the virus titer reduces to below the detection limit (>99.99%) after electrolytic treatment for 5 min, exhibiting prominently higher inactivation rate than that at 4 V (Fig. 1e) . Parallel experiments were conducted at applied voltages of 2, 4 and 5 V for 5 min (Fig. 1b) , respectively, which shows that the inactivation ratios above 90% are all very close and thereby demonstrates the well replicability of the electrochemical inactivation efficiency. The temperature of the electrolyte solution was kept below 37\u00b0C at 5 V for 2 min or at 4 V for 10 min (Fig. S4 online) , indicating that the virucidal activity is not caused by the heat. Together, these results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be effectively and efficiently inactivated in the water electrolysis process. For application of the process, the viruliferous aerosols can be ventilated into the system and then be disinfected via flowing through the microporous and air-permeable Ni-foam electrode. Viruliferous wastewater can be directly disinfected combined with a water circulation system through the Ni-foam electrode to ensure full inactivation of the virus in the solution. Long-term stability test shows that the electrolytic system can run stably for more than 1000 h at the working voltage of 4 or 5 V (Fig. S5 online) , exhibting significant potential in continuous inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "The RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) glycoprotein directly interacts with the human cellular receptor ACE2, which is essential for virus entry in causing the pneumonia [20, 32, 33] . Thus, we speculate that the structures of the RBD may be broken during the electrochemical inactivation process, which thereby blocks infection. MS-based proteomic analysis was carried out to explore the decomposition of RBDs in the dynamic electrolysis process. The RBDs were resuspended in 2 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 in the electrochemical system at a constant voltage of 5 V. Significant reduction in the quantity of the RBDs during the electrolysis process was observed as time increases (Fig. 2a) . After electrolysis for 5 min, the relative abundance of the RBDs was reduced to about 6.5% (Fig. 2b) . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognized as efficient reagents for degradation of organic water contaminants and also proteins [34, 35] . Several cleavage sites were identified after electrochemical decomposition of the RBDs, which confirmed the degradation of the RBDs during the electrolysis (Fig. 2c) . Interestingly, 13 of 27 identified electrochemical cleavage sites are aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan, which all have high reactivity towards the ROS [36] . Moreover, these cleavage sites are all closely located in the structure of the RBD (Fig. 2c) . The high percentage of aromatic amino acids (15 tyrosines, 2 tryptophans and 14 phenylalanines) in the RBD sequence makes it easy to be attacked by the ROS and subsequently decomposed. In order to further gain a detailed picture of the oxidation and degradation process of the RBDs, we further analyzed the RBDs oxidation statuses at different electrolysis time. Several peptides with different oxidation levels were characterized, most of which can be identified in the RBDs processed with 15 s of electrolysis (Table S2 online). As the treatment time increases, the oxidized proteins were further degraded and cleaved into small peptides or amino acid fragments. These results suggest that the electrochemical inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 is at least partially due to the oxidative cleavage and decomposition of the RBDs.",

S1 and S6 online). This is also confirmed by in-situ XAS data of Ni K-edge of the anode, showing that the absorption edge shifts to higher energy levels during the water electrolysis (Fig. 3a, b) . High-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) characterizations also show that the anode catalyst is in a layered morphology with d-spacing of 2.4 \u00c5 in the crystal lattice corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane of NiOOH ( Fig. 3c and Fig. S7 online) .",

Thus, at the applied voltage of 5 V for the electrolysis, which corresponds to anodic potential of 3.81 V vs. the RHE (see more details in Supplementary material), the abundant O lat sites in the basal plane can serve as active sites for the OER. To simplify the oxidation and cleavage mechanism of the virus protein, we adopted a propionyl ethylamine molecule containing a peptide bond and two a-carbon atoms to represent a typical unit of protein. The reaction intermediate O lat O* as the most oxidative surface species can facilely abstract a hydrogen atom from both a-carbon sites, generating a-carbon free radicles and O lat OH* species (Fig. 3e) . The OH part of the O lat OH* may transfer to the free radicle sites to form a-carbon alcohols with significant free energy gains of around 2.7 eV. The formation of a-carbon radicles can also induce the cleavage of the peptide backbone with the help of O 2 [36] . The propionyl ethylamine can also be adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy (O v ) site generated from desorption of the O lat O* in the OER process (Fig. 3f) . After four steps of electron-coupled OH \u00c0 attack on the adsorbed peptide bond, the propionyl ethylamine can be favorably decomposed to acetyl hydroxylamine and propionic acid even at the equilibrium potential of 1.99 V for the OER at the basal plane O lat sites (Fig. 3f) . Similar scenarios are also obtained at the edge of the NiOOH catalyst, where the propionyl ethylamine can be oxidized by the O* species and the adsorbed peptide bond can be easily decomposed at the Ni site (Fig. S9 online) . Oxidation of another peptide molecule, i.e., glycylglycine, by the O lat O* in the basal plane and O* at the edge were also calculated which presents similar free energy pathways compared with those of the propionyl ethylamine molecule (Fig. S10 online) . These results point out a feasible way of deactivating the virus via oxidizing and decomposing the virus protein by the ROS with the help of active sites on the anodic catalyst surface.",

It employs Ni-foam electrodes and Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution and is free of hazardous products. High inactivation efficiency can be achieved at an applied voltage of 5 V, where the inactivation ratio reaches 95% in only 30 s, up to 99% in 2 min and 99.99% in 5 min. The electrolytic system can run stably for more than 1000 h at the working voltage. Experimental and theoretical studies of the inactivation mechanism indicate that the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be oxidized and degraded on the in-situ formed NiOOH surface at the anode during the electrolysis, which disables the virus and blocks the infection. This strategy provides an environmental-friendly route for highly efficient disinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous effluents and could offer significant help for preventing the pandemic COVID-19.",
