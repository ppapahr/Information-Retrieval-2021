These recommendations will evolve as knowledge about COVID-19 increases. Previous statements have provided insights into the clinical and ethical challenges that critical care specialists are facing [1] [2] [3] [4] . Moreover, the review from Joebges and Andorno [5] provided a multinational perspective on the ethics guidelines on COVID-19 triage. Alternatives to the first-come first-serve principle have been emphasized [6] by addressing fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and rewarding instrumental value, and giving priority to the worst off. Patient's wills, age-related considerations, social considerations (no decision can me made based on person's wealth or ability to pay), and the specific issues in patients with cognitive impairment have also been highlighted [5] . As discussed by the authors, guidelines also have the potential to reduce the burden on those who need to determine which patient gets access to a scarce resource.",

That includes policies and protocols for early extubation, sometimes with bridge to high flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation. Opening step-down units dedicated to weaning and non-invasive ventilation appears as a very valuable option. Alternatively, we may discharge a patient already in the ICU (bumping). This solution involves earlier-than-planned extubation of the ICU patient, who is then transferred to an intermediate structure (equipped with high oxygen flow devices and facilities to manage tracheostomized patients). Clinicians may also be keen to implement as early as possible a decision to forgo life-sustaining therapy that includes early extubation with immediate ICU discharge. Again, time constraints weigh heavily here. In a pressured environment with the need for urgent ICU admission, early discharge decisions may also apply to seriously ill patients in whom decisions to forgo life-sustaining therapies have been implemented. It is crucial that these decisions can be made following the best ethical standards, including early introduction of palliative care as well as support for families.",
