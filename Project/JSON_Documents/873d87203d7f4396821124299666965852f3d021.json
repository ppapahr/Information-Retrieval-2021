The intangible positive effects of international student mobility also encompass academic, research, cultural, and experiential dimensions, thanks to which societies can become more innovative, inclusive and interconnected (Choudaha 2019) .",

Iglesias (*) School of Tourism, Hospitality and Gastronomy, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain e-mail: montserrat.iglesias@cett.cat This chapter examines academic tourism through the specific lens of linguistic competence development. The global scope of foreign language acquisition in study abroad sojourns is outlined first, followed by a conceptualisation of what constitutes language tourism in relation to both academic tourism and educational tourism. Next, a general overview of the Spanish language travel industry is presented, before focusing more precisely on a state-of-the-art review of language tourism in Spanish universities. A discussion based on key remarks from the previous sections follows, and finally we move on to the conclusions deriving from the whole chapter, with a reference to future research approaches.",

Every year over 350,000 Erasmus+ participants test their language skills and become more proficient with OLS.

It has been considered a subtype of cultural tourism (Taboada de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010), intersecting with educational and youth tourism (Pi\u00e9drola et al. 2017 ). However, the age segments of language tourists nowadays range widely, as well as the rest of their demographic features, their inner motivations, behaviours and perceptions. Similarly, other aspects of the market system, such as the product composition, the market and management structures, and the destination's environmental and social resource base can also vary in nature (Iglesias 2018) . The disparities in the offer and the demand can give birth to a myriad of language tourism experiences. As a matter of fact, language tourism can also be practiced in informal learning environments, i.e. in contexts where the educational input is not provided through formal tuition. Nevertheless, most language travellers use the services of formal education providers (Iglesias 2017a ). Formal language instruction can be supplied to a wide range of learner targets, and international university students are one of them, in their dual role of language and academic tourists. Thus, language tourism in higher education environments can be regarded as an academic tourism activity, and both language and academic tourism activities can be conceptualised under the umbrella of educational tourism, and be linked to cultural tourism, too.",

The former can even be embedded in the latter, but they are not interchangeable in their full sense, as foreign language acquisition at university can either be a major interest, or just one among other areas of study, or simply an incidental option for international academic travellers. In the first case, academic tourists may also be seen as language tourists, whereas this overlap is blurred in the second scenario depending on the type of motivation for and dedication to language learning. The third situation definitely prevents academic travellers from being considered as language tourists, since language learning is not a major travel purpose for them.",

To start with, when compared with other types of visitors, both academic and language tourists seem to stay for longer periods, and their consumer patterns are more similar to locals' behaviour. Besides, the choice of accommodation and the high capacity of attracting new visits from their acquaintances also differentiate them from other tourists. Due to the fact that both types of tourism actually share part of their nature, the research outcomes linked to these common characteristics can be transferable, for instance when it comes to the reported higher sustainability degree of academic stays with respect to other conventional types of holidays, mainly from an economic and a social perspective (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2013 ). Yet, other idiosyncratic traits more specifically related to language learning can constitute distinguishing features that do not allow for extrapolation, for example when it comes to push and pull factors, or with regard to informal educational settings, like work placements, home tuition, volunteering, and multicentre alternatives (Iglesias 2019) .",

In the Americas, Spanish as a foreign language is the main one in the US and the second most important in Brazil. Moreover, some other countries in the Maghreb, Asia and Oceania are also becoming interested in the Spanish language progressively, e.g. Morocco, China, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand (Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Formaci\u00f3n Profesional 2018).",

A third-party provider is an independent organisation that facilitates study abroad programmes acting as an intermediary between universities. It is mostly hired by American and Canadian universities or independent students that want to go abroad with an all-inclusive package, which often includes accommodation, course registration at the Spanish university, medical insurance, transfers, cultural visits and trips, as well as other activities like volunteering or leisure pursuits, sometimes with local residents. Their educational programmes combine Spanish courses with other academic content to gain credits and transfer them to their home universities.

Given that language tourists tend to stay longer in their destinations than mass tourists, their direct, indirect and induced positive economic impacts are significant (Pi\u00e9drola et al. 2017) , for example in Castilla-La Mancha (Aranda and Molina 2007) , Salamanca (Carrera et al. 2009; Pardo 2011 ), Valladolid (Redondo-Carretero et al. 2017 , Galicia (Taboada de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2012 Rodr\u00edguez et al. , 2013 , Alicante (Barra et al. 2019), Barcelona (Iglesias 2017b) and C\u00f3rdoba (Pi\u00e9drola et al. 2016) . Pardo (2011) maintains that the effects of language tourism are globally positive for Spain, and more specifically for those cities whose cultural heritage and prestigious universities are well-known. He pinpoints several benefits for two such cities, namely Salamanca and Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. From a socioeconomic perspective, longer stays are favoured instead of one-day excursions from nearby Madrid, so new service providers and employment opportunities arise, and leisure activity is boosted. Furthermore, the economic growth leads to urban regeneration and architectonic restoration in the long run. The image of these cultural cities and their centenary identity are strengthened, and their international projection is reinforced. Consequently, language tourism allows for greater diversification, reduces seasonality, fosters the use of cultural services, enhances the image of these destinations, and increases economic profitability, which stimulates the demand for complementary activities intertwined with other types of tourism, e.g. gastronomic, rural, backpacking or sports. As indicated by Carrera et al. (2009) , 67% of the Erasmus students who studied at the University of Salamanca in 2006 took complementary Spanish courses. The numerous Erasmus students who stay in Spain for a semester, coupled with those secondary students who will eventually take part in a mobility programme, are therefore a substantial market niche.",

The average monthly expenditure per student was estimated at 752 \u20ac, but, interestingly, different patterns for language learners and for exchange students were observed at a closer look. Language students' expenditure was averagely higher. Nevertheless, their stays only lasted 2.1 months versus 6.6 months in the case of exchange students.

On account of their academic programme, 83% of the respondents spent between 3 and 6 months in Barcelona, and for 73% meals were excluded from the accommodation arrangements, since they shared apartments. Almost everybody used public transport during their stay, and they engaged in leisure activities such as cultural visits (82%), night activities (78%), and sport activities (32%). In terms of nightlife, most of the students (67%) used to go to pubs, clubs or discos. All in all, 57% thought it had been quite easy to adapt to a Spanish-speaking environment. The interaction with locals, reported as quite frequent by 46% of the respondents, may have enabled such adjustment, even though more than half of them did not interact very often in Spanish with local students (Iglesias 2017b) .",

Two recent research projects conducted in Barcelona have examined the language tourism industry in that city with a special focus on socio-cultural aspects, and counted on the participation of international and local students, as well as host families (Aliaga et al. 2018; Iglesias et al. 2019) . The results reveal that language tourists do not always interrelate with locals in Spanish owing to the activities they undertake with other international students. However, all the local students who met other international peers either through university classes or extra academic activities became friends with them. In conclusion, thanks to the strong bonds with foreign students that were created among host families and local students, all of them became more open-minded and tolerant, aware of cultural diversity, and conscious with their own cultural background. Alc\u00e1zar et al. (2019) have also researched cross-cultural issues and the main obstacles for language tourists' integration in the host community. These authors highlight the potentially significant transformational value of language tourism for both international students and local residents deriving from social interaction between them. The opportunity to intermingle with locals daily in different settings can be facilitated by elements like the educational milieu or some lodging options, since housing can be essential in preventing the creation of international bubbles. Pi\u00e9drola et al. (2016) claim as well that a good relationship between international and local students alongside the successful integration in host families fosters the provision of a high quality tourist service and the cultural enrichment of both tourists and residents. The positive impact of tourism development on the well-being of the local community is a key factor for its active involvement, which results in a destination's optimal positioning. Moreover, a sustainable approach leads to a high degree of tourist satisfaction. As a matter of fact, the evidence gathered through surveys to international university students shows that they are usually very satisfied with the destination and with their language tourism experience (Pi\u00e9drola et al. 2016; Iglesias 2017b) , which aligns with the findings reported by Turespa\u00f1a (2008) .",

The strategic approach for language tourism must aim to improve current products and services, but also to develop a new offer to attract repeat visitors, reduce seasonality and allow for territorial redistribution. The language tourism product is to be restructured so that it can be specifically marketed for different targets, underscoring the high quality of all the components of the language tourism experience (Turespa\u00f1a 2008) . Therefore, the quality standards of the service provided by both the tourism industry and the educational institutions must be guaranteed (Aranda and Molina 2007) .

However, enhanced coordination across the country is needed, and the limited experience that many Spanish cities have in this sector can be transformed into a competitive advantage if an appropriate approach is adopted. International mobility and its synergies with the tourism industry must be examined so as to cater for this type of expanding demand. Since the Spanish language is considered an asset throughout the Ibero-American community, some joint lines of action should be undertaken, such as agreements between Latin American and Spanish universities to organise and market Spanish language courses worldwide, particularly taking into account that language tourists can eventually become the best promoters of a geographical region (Pi\u00e9drola et al. 2017) . Providing a good image of the destination and raising awareness of its distinctive characteristics is essential in terms of pull factors (Taboada de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga 2010), while language tourism can also produce greater engagement with the hosting region.

In addition to the loss of jobs and spending power, particularly in lower-income and middle-income groups, the psychological impact on individuals is unpredictable. After having been on coronavirus lockdown, appreciation of freedom and willingness to travel may determine the influx of tourists. Conversely, the concern for safety can undermine consumer behaviour, so analysing the health risks to minimise them, providing psychological care, and implementing safety procedures will be fundamental to restore the confidence of tourists, residents and tourism professionals. In fact, this new variable might not only shape new patterns of travel behaviour and choice of destinations, but also the reluctance to welcome tourists from certain geographical regions as xenophobic collateral damage. It is therefore crucial for governments and stakeholders to investigate and work on recovery policies, as well as to raise awareness among host communities of the convenience of welcoming tourists in order to encourage economic revitalisation. This situation can actually be also regarded as an opportunity to reshape tourism from a more sustainable perspective, for example in formerly overcrowded destinations, so that the perceived benefits are not just utopian. It must be born in mind that the Covid-19 crisis has also promoted solidarity and altruism.",

            "text": "Thus, this challenging phenomenon could be turned into an opportunity for new approaches worth exploring, and also for market diversification and restructuring. For instance, analysing the behaviour patterns of outbound and inbound markets that recover first can shed light on future tourism trends. In the short run, it will be necessary to study if reimbursing measures for existing bookings-like corona vouchers-have proved effective, or the scope and impact of cancellations and delays. On the other hand, as business and social activities which are not deemed essential have been cut down or have become online, virtual horizons have been broadened. This raises the issue of taking into consideration if education and travel are essential needs, and if online education and travel will replace or reduce educational trips, for example through augmented reality, or by means of synchronous or asynchronous learning methodologies. Last but not least, since social media have become even more important as a source of information, their role in tourism promotion and travel arrangements may also be strengthened, hence the need to continue exploring new avenues of investigation thereupon.",
