Further, preterm birth has become the most common cause of infant death in China. The perinatal mortality rate among preterm infants is four to six times higher than that among normal term infants. Multicentre studies have reported an increase in the survival rate of preterm infants; however, the incidence of complications for these children remains higher than that in developed countries. [3] [4] [5] [6] If effective and comprehensive interventions are not taken promptly, the growth, development and nutritional status of preterm infants will lag behind those of normal-term infants. 7 Compared with full-term infants, preterm infants are more likely to develop neurological developmental defects due to immature brain development.

Neurotrophic factors in breast milk, including longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, sialic acid, taurine, hormones and growth factors, as well as neuroprotective factors, including glutamic acid, probiotics and oligosaccharides, may play an important role in nervous system development and cannot be substituted by other dairy products. The benefits of breast milk for preterm infants may occur through the direct and indirect mechanisms of nutrition, antioxidants, immune regulation, neuroprotection and reduced complications. [15] [16] [17] Studies have reported a dose-dependent relationship of breast milk intake with IQ and the entire adolescent brain volume; further, it is positively correlated with the volume of the hippocampus and deep grey matter nuclei. 18 19 Belfort et al 20 evaluated 180 breastfeeding (BF) preterm infants for 28 days after birth and found that when breast milk intake exceeded 50% of enteral nutrition, the BF duration extended by 1 day and the baby's IQ increased by 0.5 points. When the breast milk intake increased by 10 mL/(kg/day), IQ scores increased by 0.7 points. Lenehan et al 21 reported a significant positive relationship of BF with compound and non-verbal IQ scores at 5 years of age. Further, Belfort et al 20 analysed the relationship between BF and neurological developmental outcomes at 7 years of age and observed a positive correlation of breast milk intake with intelligence, memory, motor function and academic achievement. In addition, they reported that the advantages of breast milk for neurodevelopment can continue into old age, which is particularly reflected in speech reasoning ability. 22 The aforementioned literature indicates a positive correlation between breast milk and brain development. However, there are currently no prospective longitudinal follow-up studies confirming the effect of breast milk on neuronal development in preterm infants. It is necessary to conduct such a study in the Chinese population who has never undergone such research due to different genetic backgrounds, living environments and ethnic groups. Further, there is a need to clarify the association between BF and brain development in preterm infants and identify the key factors that may be involved.",

The consistency of the ASQ and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-3rd Edition-Screening Test is positively correlated with age (the correlation coefficient increased from 0.55 at 8 months to 0.75 at 30 months); moreover, the consistency in preterm infants is higher than that in full-term infants. 41 42 Compared with the Gesell Developmental Schedules, the ASQ has a sensitivity of 87.74% and a specificity of over 85%. 43 The ASQ contains 20 age groups with each having 30 questions that evaluate five areas: individual-social, rough movements, fine movements, problem solving and communication skills, which should be completed within 12-18 min. Infants or children with scores higher than the threshold (defined in the questionnaire description) are considered normal, those with scores close to the threshold are considered marginal, and those with scores below the threshold are considered impaired with further diagnostic testing required. 44 The ASQ has been translated into several languages and is widely used worldwide with high applicability and internal consistency. 45 46 It can be used to screen developmental behaviours of children in regions with low economic levels 47 48 ; moreover, the average ASQ scores in European, American and Asian populations are relatively consistent.

Studies have confirmed that the breast milk composition of preterm mothers differs from that of full-term mothers and is characterised by increased protein content, reduced fat and lactose content and elevated peptides and hormones that promote gastrointestinal maturity. 49 Breast milk has advantages over artificial formula. 50 Breast milk can improve digestion and absorption in preterm infants, meet their nutritional needs and promote rapid growth and development. Premature breast milk can help regulate immune function and improve the long-term health of preterm infants. The exclusive BF rate and BF duration in hospitalised preterm infants are significantly lower than those in full-term newborns. [51] [52] [53] [54] Preterm infants are transferred to the NICU immediately after birth for disease observation, diagnosis and treatment, which results in separation of mother and child, leading to insufficient lactation, an important factor that affects BF in preterm infants. 55 BF impacts the health economics of developing countries, improves the health of mothers and infants and reduces social inequities while reducing the incidence of infectious diseases, especially for disadvantaged children in poor areas. [56] [57] [58] [59] This study explores the association of different proportions in breast milk exposure with brain development in preterm infants. The proportion of breast milk exposure may be a cost-effective neurodevelopment predictor in preterm infants. Our findings could be used to evaluate the proportion of in-hospital breast milk feeding for preterm infants to identify preterm infants requiring monitoring of their neurodevelopment. This could allow early measures for reducing neurodevelopment complications. For underdeveloped areas, an appropriate increase in breast milk exposure is an important health measure for improving the neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants. Additionally, this study is expected to determine whether exclusive breast milk feeding can be achieved and the proportion of breast milk exposure that can better promote the development of preterm infants. This study may provide recommendations regarding the proportion of breast milk exposure for individuals presenting difficulty in achieving exclusive BF.",
