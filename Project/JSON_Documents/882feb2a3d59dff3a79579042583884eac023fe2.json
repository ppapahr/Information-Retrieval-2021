However, other authors have reported that haematological parameters, such as haematocrit, total WBC, neutrophil and lymphocytes were not correlated with the gammaglobulin concentrations (Shelton et al., 1995) . The discrepancies observed may be due to the different number of animals included in each study (89 in the present study, five in the one conducted by Shelton), or to the variability of the virulence of the infective strain (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997) . In any case, few studies have been undertaken in which the haematological parameters are compared with the serum fractions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 178, "text": "(Ackley et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 715, "end": 737, "text": "(Shelton et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 964, "end": 994, "text": "(Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "FeLV+ cats were found, on average, to be slightly hypergammaglobulinemic. It has been reported that amongst other observations, FeLV infection (specifically FeLV-induced immunodeficiency) is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia (Hoover et al., 1987) . In fact, most of the animals included in the study had low gammaglobulin levels (86.7%); however, four animals, non related to each other, that had gammaglob-ulin levels higher than 3.0 g/dl raised the mean. Two of these animals were female kittens 4 and 5 months old, which died of acute respiratory signs shortly after being taken to the practitioner. The high gammaglobulin levels could be due, either to maternal antibodies or to a very severe infection in such young kittens (one of them had severe lymphocytosis of 91%). The other two (also females) had vesicular lesions in the oral mucosa, which could have been caused by secondary infections. The possibility of infection by FIP virus was investigated in these four cats, both serologically with sera 90 days apart (only in the last two cats), and clinically. Both parameters were negative, and FIP was not considered an explanation to the hypergammaglobulinemia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 251, "text": "(Hoover et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Double-infected animals had higher levels of a1-globulin than both FIV+ and FeLV+ cats (Table 3) . However, these data have to be regarded cautiously, because of the small number of animals in the group. As regards a2-globulin, statistically significant differences were also seen between FeLV+ cats and non-infected cats. Most a1 and a2 proteins are acute phase proteins, considered to be markers for acute inflammatory disease, infection or neoplastic and traumatic disorders (Duthie et al., 1997; Pocacqua et al., 2005) . An increase in these fractions is an indicator of tissue damage and can be attributed to the fact that the pathogen induces an acute phase response in the host, as reported in FIP (Giordano et al., 2004) or in canine leishmaniosis (Miro\u00b4and Fraile, 1999) . One of these acute phase proteins, a1-acid-glycoprotein or AGP, is considered as immunomodulator, and it has diagnostic value in FIP (Duthie et al., 1997; Kajikawa et al., 1999) . It has been reported to be increased in FIV infections (Duthie et al., 1997) , which would mean that FIV-positive cats would have elevated a-proteins in the serum, a fact we did not observe. In the present study, cats were not in the terminal stage of the disease (as were the cats in Duthie's study) which may account for this discrepancy.

The plasma electrophoretogram is useful for assessing the initial clinical status, and could be a valuable tool to determine the clinical course of the disease, during and after suitable therapy. High gammaproteins, as seen in FIV-infection, should alert about an increase in the humoral immune response, probably reflecting the uncontrolled replication of the virus and higher presence in the bloodstream. Acute phase proteins, which migrate in the a-globulins fractions, are indicative of microbial infection or following inflammatory stimulus, and also in neoplastic and traumatic disorders, and they are helpful as indicators in clinical diagnosis. After empirical treatment, such as with interferon (De Mari et al., 2004) , it would be advisable to follow-up these parameters, to assess the results objectively, economically and easily.
