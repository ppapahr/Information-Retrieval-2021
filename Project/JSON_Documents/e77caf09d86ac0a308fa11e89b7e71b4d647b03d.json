Our results, using both GARCH (1,1) and VAR specifications, suggest that such events are directly affecting the dry bulk and the dirty tanker segments. In addition, the results also suggest that second round effects, mostly via the decline in oil prices and, in some cases, third round effects via the impact from the stock market, also exist. Finally, by employing daily port calls a proxy variable for the demand for transportation services, we show that both the dry bulk and clean tankers are highly affected by the demand side of the economy, while vessels which transport crude oil do not register such a relationship.",

First, it is the first time that a shipping cycle collapse is examined in the short run rather than as a point of a longer-duration cycle, allowing us to have a closer look at how freight rates are affected by rapid changes in the macroeconomic environment. Moreover, we employ, for the first time, what appears to be one of the best proxies for demand available, namely vessel port calls, which are able to better assist us in capturing the demand-side changes in the shipping. Finally, through the use of the coronavirus variable in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we effectively turn an event-study methodology into an endogenous reaction, allowing us to observe how the whole system is affected when an unexpected shock occurs, and not just rely on how a variable reacts in a simple OLS framework.",

Shipowners, charterers, operators, and policymakers are all affected from the pandemic. As the results suggest, the excess drop in the industry's returns that hits the market in such exogenous events affect largely the cash flow generating abilities of shipping companies. This leaves companies with income problems that affect the companies themselves and consequently their investors, management, and employees. Moreover, on a broader perspective, extended stakeholders are affected by such events, like governments on a tax perspective. To address this issue, market participants could try to reduce losses and limit volatility in freight rates by entering into paper markets J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 (FFAs, Futures) and engage in chartering activities. For policymakers, especially in locations which have been traditionally considered shipping hubs (Greece, Cyprus, Singapore, Shanghai, etc.) , adverse changes in shipping companies' cash flows can potentially mean reductions in output as well as job losses, which could hurt the local economy, and thus they may need to use targeted measures to account for that.",

Similarly, the index would capture any changes in the economy-wide (and worldwide) risk sentiment. The benefit of using the abovementioned variables is that it allows us to use a higher frequency, given that they are all available on a daily basis.

As such, with demand declining, freight rates drop. This impact can be quantified in our estimates, with the stock market acting as a proxy for industrial and consumer activity, given that it is quick to capture changes in corporate profits and future potential. Then, this effect is passed on to oil prices and then to freight rates.

More precisely, an increase of 1% of the cases of the coronavirus reported globally, would decrease the Baltic Dry Index by 0.03% and the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index by 0.046%. While, the latter decreases do not seem large, one should consider both the daily nature of the data as well as the cumulative effect during the period of the pandemic.",

This supports the importance of using tankers as storage capacity during periods of oil market distress and the oil future curve is in contango (Regli and Adland, 2019): while commodities transported by dry bulk vessels and clean tankers J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 20 cannot be easily stored given both their nature and the need for specific facilities, crude oil can be stored much more easily given that it can simply remain in the vessel.",

Shipowners, charterers, operators could try to reduce losses and limit volatility in freight rates by entering into paper markets (FFAs, Futures) and engage in chartering activities. Furthermore, as the shipping industry has already been notoriously volatile due to its relationship with world trade and output, we expect that this will further add to this volatile nature, and the impact will highly affect shipping companies' cash flows, leaving both ship-owners and the industry's stakeholders Figure 2 reports the impulse responses from the VAR model, as specified in section 3. BDI to Global Calls refers to the response of the BDI to a shock in Global Calls. Vertical axis reports the magnitude of the variable response in percentage points. For example, a 1% increase in global calls would case a maximum of 0.1% increase in the BDI. Dotted lines are the 68% confidence interval. Horizontal axis refers to the periods (days) ahead after the shock took place. For example, the BCT response to a shock in Global Calls is zero after 10 days. ",

Firstly, it should be noted that the regression used ARCH errors, given that the GARCH term proved to be statistically insignificant, suggesting that past values of the variance do not have an impact in current variance. In other words, it appears that long-term variance shocks are not as important as short-term shocks(Alexander, 2008). 4    As the results show, the dry bulk index has a strong relationship with global calls, standing at around 0.45 throughout specifications(1)to(5). The BDI is also dependent on its previous values, but not to a very large extent, at 0.66. Other lags of the BDI were not found to be statistically significant. Interestingly, the coronavirus impact is statistically significant, with a 1% change in virus cases implying an additional impact of -0.03% on the BDI. It should be again underlined that due to the nature of this regression, the coronavirus impact is interpreted as additional to the drop in global port calls. Finally, it should be noted that the remaining variables, including the stock market indices and Brent oil, are not statistically significant.case. In the BCT case, it appears that the GARCH term is larger than the ARCH term, suggesting that shocks are kept in the variance for longer. Brent oil has the opposite relationship to the BDTI than the once anticipated: the results in table 5 suggest that Brent oil is negatively related to the BDTI.",
