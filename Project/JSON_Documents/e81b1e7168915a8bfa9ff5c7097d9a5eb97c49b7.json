They found that the intervention's stress -reducing effect was mediated via selective neural responses and information trafficking patterns. Two other studies used electroencephalography (EEG) and emotional faces as stimuli; Yang et al. reported neural events underlying automatic and regulatory patterns of emotion appraisal, whereas Liu et al. found an interesting relationship between frontal EEG alpha asymmetry and individual differences in the processing of congruent and incongruent fearful faces. Similarly, but using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fMRI, Jung and Kim looked at individual differences in the tendency to compare oneself with others, and found that these were predicted by different patterns of functional and structural brain connectivity. For the very relevant but understudied research field of olfaction, behavioral and fMRI evidence shows that social signals are transported with smells. Sch\u00e4fer et al. demonstrate that mothers are able to detect the developmental state of children by smelling their body odors, especially when they have own children of similar age. Smelling odors of stressed persons leads to an increased activation of the Amygdala and related networks in healthy subjects that have a history of childhood trauma, as reported by Maier et al. This hypersensitivity to stress signals can be dampened by oxytocin.",

Eckstein et al. reviewed the current state of research on the role of social and non-social (robotic) touch for stress-relief from a medical as well as technical view, taking into account subjective experience and objective physiology. Matyjek et al. summarized multiple dimensions of social and non-social rewards, such as duration, familiarity, and source in a model in order to allow a differentiated description and recommendations for experimental comparisons. Levy and Bader follow on the empirical data above on subjective experience of emotions, empathy, and the integration of these experiences with neural data. They do so by providing a novel neurophenomenological framework (i.e., integrating neuroscience and subjective experience) on empathy, thereby extending dichotomous accounts and bringing forward an ecologically valid approach to real-life empathic encounters, while reporting empirical supporting evidence from magnetoencephalography (MEG) and other neuroimaging studies.",

The heterogeneity of these studies reflects the multiplicity of scientific approaches to study the complex processes and mechanisms involved in emotions and reward in social settings. This is particularly relevant at a time when (nondigital) social interaction is being reduced due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while providing an outlook on the involvement of multiple levels during social interactions. Thus, the research topic can motivate researchers to reproduce these findings and to test new hypotheses. For instance, what are the differences in mechanisms implicated during digital vs. non-digital social interaction? Does it influence interpersonal empathy? Does it implicate more stress and less reward? Finally, this topic can pave the road toward designing innovative interventions targeting the different levels of social interaction as outlined here (Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "Overview on multi-method perspectives for investigating social interaction. positive affect in the daily life of young adults with a family history of depression. For females suffering from acute major depression, Warth et al., could show that an instructed positive interaction with their romantic partners results in higher stress levels, as assessed with cortisol on the one hand, but also improved relationship quality on the other hand. Therefore, adding to the evidence that the interaction of reward and stress is modulated in affective disorders. Likewise, in a single-subject study on a patient with acquired damage of bilateral amygdalae, Piretti et al. integrate the neural level with the subjective experience of emotions, thereby pointing out the interaction between this neural substrate and subjective shame during social norm violations. Kroczek et al. investigated interpersonal distance in social interaction using a novel paradigm in virtual reality to study social anxiety behavior of avoidance in real-life settings, and by integrating subjective experience, behavior, and physiology. For patients suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, Schneider et al., could show a beneficial effect of applying the neuromodulator oxytocin for behavioral hypersensitivity/avoidance toward threatening facial stimuli. These findings nicely complement the above mentioned Maier et al.'s study of oxytocin's dampening effect to stress hypersensitivity in healthy controls with a history of childhood maltreatment.",
