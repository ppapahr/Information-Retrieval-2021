The contribution of the non-respiratory symptomatology of COVID-19 to prognosis is currently unclear. As shown by a recent case series, the presenting symptomatology of an infection with SARS CoV II can include gastrointestinal symptoms e.g. diarrhea or vomiting, as well as neurological manifestations including headache, anosmia and dizziness [2] [3] [4] . While recent editorials call for enhanced clinical concern for central nervous system pathology within the course of SARS CoV 2 infection, a direct correlation between an infection with this viral agent and neurological morbidity remains unclear [5] [6] [7] .

During earlier coronavirus outbursts, including during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreak in 2012, reports have been published on coronavirus spreading to the central nervous system by directly infestation of the central nervous system (CNS) [9] [10] [11] [12] . Several hypotheses on CNS infiltration have been formulated, including viral transmission from the nasal cavity via the olfactory nerve [13] , but a recent report did not find direct viral CNS entry [14] . We hereby present a case of massive and rapidly fatal cerebral edema in a patient who was admitted to the ICU with severe ARDS due to COVID-19. In this case, the absence of histopathological evidence or cerebrospinal fluid analysis complicates determination of a certain diagnosis. The differential diagnosis in this case includes: (massive) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), hemorrhagic/necrotizing (viral) encephalitis (and thereby developing reactive cerebral edema) and (massive) vasculitis [15] . SARS CoV 2 is the latest descendent in the strain of coronaviruses, with prior fellow species suggested to (directly) cause necrotizing encephalitis. CT scan showed multiple juxtacortical hemorrhages (figure 4), which may well fit the diagnosis of cranial sinus thrombosis. Remarkably, cortex involvement was limited, making arterial infarction less suspect as a cause for cerebral vasogenic edema. Of note, hypercoagulability in COVID-19 has recently been well described and was present in this patient despite treatment with therapeutic LMWH [16] . ",

            "text": "replacement therapy was initiated. After 7 days on the ICU, a CT-scan of the thorax was indicated as the ARDS persisted, showing bilateral pulmonary emboli despite prophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Therapeutic LMWH was subsequently started (10.000IE, twice daily) instead of prophylactic dosage. During the first two weeks of ICU admission the patient was managed on mechanical ventilation requiring high dosages of sedatives (midazolam) and intermittent neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium. Intermittent prone positioning was done during the first week of admission. The clinical course was further characterized by hemodynamic stability, requiring low dose norepinephrine. Lactate levels remained normal. During the second week, respiratory condition markedly improved as indicated by improved paO2/fiO2 ratio, and ventilator settings improved to assisted-breathing and sedatives could tapered. On day 15, approximately 24 hours after midazolam sedation had been stopped, dilated and non-reactive pupils were noted on physical examination. An emergency CT-scan and CT-angiography of the brain showed extensive cerebral edema and brain herniation (figures 2 and 3). Several subcortical hemorrhages were present without focal areas of arterial infarction (figure 4). CT-angiography showed absence of cerebral perfusion distally from the internal carotid arteries. The patient had remained in a hypercoagulable state, despite the administration of therapeutic dosages of LMWH, as was confirmed by thromboelastometry (supplementary figure 1) with a modestly elevated fibrinogen level of 5.7 g/liter (reference range: 2.0-4.0 g/liter). Partial thromboplastin time was normal and activated partial thromboplastin time was 25 seconds (reference range: 25-31 seconds). Brain stem reflexes on subsequent clinical neurological examination were absent. Given the infaust prognosis, further treatment was considered futile and the patient died shortly afterwards. The patient's relatives granted consent for publication of his case, autopsy was not performed.",
