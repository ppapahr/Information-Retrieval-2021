A multimodal CT showed an M2 branch occlusion of the left MCA, and a corresponding focal perfusion deficit without basal ganglia involvement, as well as a thrombosed aortic arch (Fig. 1 , second row, first and second images). She underwent urgent endovascular treatment with successful revascularization and partial clinical improvement. Two days after the procedure, the deficits worsened and presented abnormal choreic movements of the right limbs, that ceased with iv haloperidol. The MRI showed an acute ischemic stroke affecting the left insular and parietal cortex and complete sparing of the basal ganglia ( Fig. 1 , second row, third and fourth images). At discharge, the patient recovered completely and did not need chronic neuroleptic treatment. Perfusion computed tomography (CTP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all 4 patients. The first two images on top row show a CTP of patient 1 while symptomatic, with delayed perfusion in the right fronto-parietal cortex, as shown in the time-to-peak (TTP) with normal perfusion of deep structures; third and fourth images show follow-up diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI of the same patient after symptom resolution with patchy acute ischemic lesions in the right convexity, sparing the basal ganglia. The two images to the left on the second row show TTP CTP of patient 2, during the first asymptomatic phase, with delayed perfusion on the left insular, frontal and parietal cortex with normal perfusion of basal ganglia; the two images to the right show MRI fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences after the onset of right hemichoreic movements, where ischemic left insular, frontal, and postcentral gyrus lesions can be appreciated; note the absence of compromise of the deep territory. The two images on the third row consist of the DWI MRI sequences of patient 3, performed while symptomatic, demonstrating a right hemispheric ischemic lesion on the posterior insula and parietal cortex, sparing the basal ganglia. Bottom row shows three DWI MRI images of patient 4, performed 24 hours after symptom onset, with ischemic lesions in the left posterior insular and parietal cortex, also without involvement of deep gray matter structures.",

Control of chorea with haloperidol in one of the cases we report would fit with this notion. Alternatively, sensory loss through reduced input from sensory to motor cortex, as seen in thalamic or parietal cortex lesions, might also play a role in the origin of hyperkinetic contralateral movements. 12 Previously reported cases could not rule out hypoperfusion of the basal ganglia due to a proximal occlusion that subsequently recanalized as the origin of the symptoms. 5\u00c09,13 In two of our cases we have evidence of limited cortical hypoperfusion during the symptomatic phase, with sparing of the basal ganglia, and all the cases were confirmed to have only cortical infarctions on MRI, suggesting a fundamental contribution of the cortex.",

In our series, the insular infarction, although present in the majority of the cases (3 out of 4), always occurred accompanied by ischemic lesions in the parietal and/or frontal cortices. Previous described cases also present with an associated insular infarction. 5 For those reasons, it is doubtful that the insular region had any role in the symptoms, and the presence of insular lesions could be just the result of poor collateral circulation in the insula in patients with large vessel occlusions involving the middle cerebral artery territory. 15 In all of our patients, symptoms ceased rapidly after stroke revascularization. This finding is in line with previous publications, 13,16 suggesting a good prognosis, probably due to preservation of the deep structures circuitry integrity.

The first two images on top row show a CTP of patient 1 while symptomatic, with delayed perfusion in the right fronto-parietal cortex, as shown in the time-to-peak (TTP) with normal perfusion of deep structures; third and fourth images show follow-up diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI of the same patient after symptom resolution with patchy acute ischemic lesions in the right convexity, sparing the basal ganglia. The two images to the left on the second row show TTP CTP of patient 2, during the first asymptomatic phase, with delayed perfusion on the left insular, frontal and parietal cortex with normal perfusion of basal ganglia; the two images to the right show MRI fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences after the onset of right hemichoreic movements, where ischemic left insular, frontal, and postcentral gyrus lesions can be appreciated; note the absence of compromise of the deep territory. The two images on the third row consist of the DWI MRI sequences of patient 3, performed while symptomatic, demonstrating a right hemispheric ischemic lesion on the posterior insula and parietal cortex, sparing the basal ganglia. Bottom row shows three DWI MRI images of patient 4, performed 24 hours after symptom onset, with ischemic lesions in the left posterior insular and parietal cortex, also without involvement of deep gray matter structures.",
