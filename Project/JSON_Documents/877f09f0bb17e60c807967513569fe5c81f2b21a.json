            "text": "Throughout human history, there have been many struggles against epidemic diseases. During the outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, plague, malaria, and tuberculosis, countries have experienced difficult times from societal and economical points of view. Following the SARS, MERS, H1N1, and EBOLA, which have been observed at the beginning of the 21 st century, a new type of coronavirus emerging from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in China, in December 2019 has spread all over the world and the WHO has declared COVID-19 pandemic on February 11, 2020. While, on one hand, studies to describe the virus, to develop vaccination and medication against the virus, and to develop alternative treatment methods were being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, developed and developing countries underwent a big test related to their health system infrastructures. Italy, recently distancing from public-centered healthcare and organizing to start up a patient-centered healthcare system, and therefore decreasing the number of the beds in hospitals and giving rise to regional inequalities in reaching the healthcare service, has been one of the capitals of the pandemic in Europe because of the late precautions taken against together with the developments given above [1] . The authorities in Italy have underlined the necessity of effective distribution of resources in health system stipulating the need for extra hospital beds of about 4000 until mid-April 2020 after the use of 5200 beds at maximum capacity already existing in intensive care units [2] . In England, where the herd immunity strategy has been followed at the beginning of the COVID-19 fight, widespread distresses have been experienced at NHS which underwent austerity policies lately resulting in budgetary cuts. Besides, it was reported that the healthcare workers throughout the country point out difficulties in obtaining personal protective equipment and equipment [3] . In Iran, one of the countries which were affected highly by the pandemic, it is clearly observed that the health sector experiences difficulties in fighting the pandemic because of the international sanctions imposed on the country in the last years. Lack of medical, pharmaceutical, and laboratory equipment in the country is a factor increasing the burden of the pandemic and the number of losses [4] . In the United States of America, where the inequality in health services is at its top and the healthcare system is completely privatized, while the number of cases and mortality increases, on one hand, the citizens of the country face with high costs at the access point of healthcare services. Besides the constraints faced up in the healthcare system, it is pointed out that the political discourses make managing the process more difficult [5, 6] . The pandemic process mirrors the healthcare systems throughout the world and plays a role of a wake-up-call system in order to step back from the privatization and commoditizing of the healthcare issues [7] .",

The Science Committee follows the situation of the world closely and based on the recommendations of the WHO practices the basic preventive measures [8] . In the context of these measures, the border gates have been closed, education and training applications were suspended, and the employees in the risk group (those who have chronic diseases, employees older than 65 and / or transplanted, cancer patients, etc.) were allowed administrative leavings. In the scope of the fight against COVID-19, while actions were taken to raise awareness for personal matters (cleaning the hands, covering up the cough, keeping social distance, and social isolation), the number of daily tests to determine the cases has gradually been increased to a number of 40.000 a day on average [9] .",

In the application of this test, a large team comprised of 5849 persons take part. Other than these studies realized in the acute stage in Turkey, the infrastructure of the healthcare services generated as a result of the \"Transformation in Healthcare\" activities since 2003 has also been effective in the process. When the existing condition in Turkey is studied [10] based on data from 2018, the number of hospitals is 1,534, the number of hospital beds is 231,913, the number of the qualified beds is 139,403. When data related to intensive care is studied [10] the number of intensive care beds is 38,098, the number of adult intensive care beds is 24,071, and the number of intensive care beds per 10,000 persons in all sectors is 4,6 in 2018. When the number of intensive care beds per 10,000 persons is studied, the result is 1,3 for Italy, 1,0 for Spain, 1,2 for France, 1,6 for the USA, and 3,5 for Germany. Turkey has a low population of 65+ persons (9%) and a high capacity of intensive care [11] . Besides, in addition to 20,000 respirators already existing in Turkey, domestic production initiated, and 5,000 respirators were manufactured until the end of May 2020. In addition to these, there are 10 city hospitals in service in Adana, Mersin, Isparta, Yozgat, Kayseri, Manisa, Elaz\u0131\u011f, Ankara, Eski\u015fehir, and Bursa provinces [12] . The first stage of the \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir Hospital got into the act on April 20, 2020. The fact that the city hospitals are equipped with more modern equipment and have more and qualified intensive care beds than other hospitals have provided a positive contribution to the process.",

On the other hand, the OECD average of the number of nurses is 8,8 and again Turkey with an average of 2,1 falls into the countries with a low average. As well as the adequacy and structure of the healthcare facilities in the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and distribution of the healthcare workforce is another significant component. In this respect, the Ministry of Health has started to apply some measures and practices related to the healthcare workforce from the day the first case was identified. An organization was declared on the pregnancy, maternity leave for the female employee, and for handicapped employee and x-ray leavings on March 13, 2020 [14] . Another decision was made on March 24, 2020, that enabled the health workforce to benefit from the public transport services free of charge and secondly, to stay in the guesthouse closest to the hospital where he/she worked free of charge to minimize the risk for their family members [15] . Another decision was taken during a capacity assessment commission meeting held on March 27, 2020 which prevented resignation for the healthcare personnel in public and private hospitals for a period of three months [16] . For the employment of 18,000 nurses and midwives a process was initiated on April 09, 2020 through On the other hand, an amendment was made in the 12 th Article of the Basic Law of the Healthcare Services on April, 15 2020 and an arrangement was put into action to increase the crimes by half that were committed against a healthcare employee [19] . There is no doubt that these reformative exercises fell in place; however, it is clear that the healthcare employees playing an active role in the struggle against the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. In this context, anxiety and stress levels of the healthcare employees must be studied and the problems they experienced must be recorded and the required countermeasures must be taken together with the support services for the healthcare employees. This research aims to determine the levels of anxiety, depression and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as collecting their opinions on the pandemic.",

The sample of the research was selected from the regions taking place the Statistical Regional Unit Classification, with the aim of obtaining a nationwide sample. In calculating the sampling size, the formula proposed by Cochran [21] was used and as a result of the calculation, the number of the employees that are going to be included in the sampling with a confidence level of 95% and with an error margin \u00b10.03 is determined as 1053 however data were collected from 2076 healthcare employees. The fact that the number of questionnaires reached is more than the sample size calculated statistically, and the distribution of healthcare employees obtained from the sample is close to the distribution in the universe by state of title (doctor 20.6%, nurse/midwife 48.8%, and health technicians 17.7%) suggest that the study sample has a good representation power of the universe. It is seen that among the participants of the study, the level of participation of nurses is higher. However, it should not be forgotten that working in situations of crisis can cause overwhelming psychological pressure to nursing staff. Nurses are always in the forefront of any dangerous medical situation, like infections.",

            "text": "Assessments based on the results of the analyses related to levels of depression, anxiety and stress show statistically meaningful differences based on their sex, marital status, ages, and titles (p<0.003). Accordingly, as for the sex variable, it was observed that levels of depression, anxiety and stress of the female employees are higher than that of male employees. As for the marital status variable, depression, anxiety and stress levels of the single employees were found to be higher than that of the married employees. Whereas, as the age of the employee increases, depression, anxiety and stress levels were observed to decrease. In order to determine the source of the difference related to the titles of the participants between the groups, a Tukey LSD test was made. The depression dimension of the difference, as a result of the test, was shown to be between the nurses/midwives (8.769\u00b14.417) and the doctors (7.722\u00b14.489) and the medical secretaries/patient consultants (7.157\u00b14.014). Accordingly, the level of the nurses is higher than that of doctors and medical secretaries. As for the anxiety dimension, it was found to be doctors (5.416\u00b13.876) and nurses (6.671\u00b14.041) and health technicians/technicians. The anxiety level of the doctors is lower than that of the nurses/midwives and health technicians and technicians. As for the stress dimension, it was found to be between nurses/midwives (9.293\u00b14.256) and doctors (8.288\u00b14.391) and medical secretaries/patient consultants (7.951\u00b14.103). According to the results, the depression level of the nurses is higher than the doctors and the medical secretaries (Table 6 ). (Table 6) An ANOVA test was analyzed to show whether the depression, anxiety and stress levels vary or not based on the working institution. The results of the analysis have shown that assessments of the participants related to the depression, anxiety and stress levels indicate significant statistical differences based on the institution they worked (p<0.001). It was found that those who work at city hospitals have higher depression, anxiety and stress levels compared to those who work at other institutions (Table 7) . (Table 7) Another ANOVA test was made to see whether depression, anxiety and stress levels differ or not based on the department of the participants. The results of the analysis have shown that the assessments related to the level of depression, anxiety and stress vary statistically based on the department of the participants (p<0.001). Those who have the highest depression, anxiety and stress levels come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (Table 8 ). It is thought that the fact that the majority of the health employees (63.1%) diagnosed with COVID-19 symptoms work in these services at the hospital where the participant works has a great impact. (Table 8) A t-test analysis was made to show whether observing COVID-19 diagnosis in the hospital where the participants work influences the level of depression, anxiety and stress or not. The results have shown that there are statistically meaningful differences at the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of the participants. Accordingly, those who work at a hospital in which COVID-19 diagnosis was made have higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than those who work at a hospital with no COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 9 ). Similarly, based on the level of contact with the patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, depression, anxiety and stress levels of the participants display statistically meaningful differences (p<0.001). Depending on the increase in the contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19, levels of depression, anxiety and stress are found to be higher (Table 10) . (Table 9 ) (Table 10) Whether the assessments of the health employees, related to the levels of depression, anxiety and stress differ based on seeing their families or on the frequency of seeing their families have been analyzed with an ANOVA test. As a result of the analysis, it is pointed out that the depression, anxiety and stress levels of the participants differ at a statistically meaningful order based on the frequency of seeing their families (p<0.001). Accordingly, the health employees seeing their families every day have lower depression, anxiety and stress levels (Table 11) . (Table 11) In this study, 50% of the health employees have indicated that they experienced protective equipment problems. It was observed that in the studies conducted in various foreign countries the health employees repeated their problems related to protective equipment. In a qualitative study conducted in China involving 13 health employees, the participants have emphasized the lack of protective equipment problem and expressed their anxiety arising from not being able to deal with the problems of the patients. They have pointed out that they did not need psychological support but instead taking a continuous rest taking off their protective equipment [29] . In the study conducted by the Turkish Thorax Society, only 30% of the health employees who participated in the study have indicated that they could get medical masks each time they demanded. This result clearly shows the lack of personal protective equipment [30] .",

Approximately 25% of the employees have expressed nutritional problems. Adam and Walls [31] have pointed out that the working conditions of the health employees were quite difficult and they were anxious about contaminating their families. For this reason, it was emphasized that, during this process, food service for the employees, breaks for taking a rest, and creating free times sufficient enough are as significant as personal protective equipment and treatment protocols. Shanfeld et al. [32] have pointed out that the best method to determine the levels of anxiety of the health employees is to listen to them, and accordingly they have arranged 8 listening sessions with 69 health employees in the first week of the pandemic in the USA. It has become very clear that the health employees expected both medical and social support by the institutions they were working for themselves and their families in the event that they were infected. Besides, the health employees expect especially the politicians to listen to them and take steps to meet their demands.",

This situation makes it urgent to find a smart solution to the common problem throughout the world. In this study, when the depression, anxiety and stress levels were studied it was observed that the levels are higher for female health employees than male employees and similarly higher for single employees than married ones and for nurses than other health employees.

In a study realized in China, involving 180 health employees, it was found out that the social support level has meaningful relation with self-efficacy and sleeping quality but, on the other hand, it has a negative relation with stress level and anxiety levels. It was concluded that anxiety level is related to stress level which affects the self-efficacy and sleeping quality negatively. For this reason, the necessity for social, psychological, and logistic support for the health employees are emphasized [34] . Greenberg [35] has pointed out that during the COVID-19 pandemic process the health employees are at risk from mental health problems point of view. It was strongly emphasized that health managers need to be proactive in order to protect the mental well-being of health employees and keep good and healthy communication with the employees.

In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) comprised of 21 expressions under three-dimension (DASS-Depression, DASS-Anxiety, and DASS-Stress) is presented. This scale was developed by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995) and the validity and reliability study for Turkish was made by Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m et al. (2018). The scale was structured in the form of Likert 4 where scoring is made as 0 = never, 1= sometimes, 2= very often, 3= all the times. The minimum point for each dimension is \"0\", and the maximum point is \"21\". In the second section of the survey, the problems the healthcare employees experienced during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the sociodemographic features of the employees (age, sex, marital status, title, the unit worked in, etc.) were investigated.",

The number of infected health employees comprises 6.5% of the total number infected. According to the data published by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 14, 2020, 9,282 health employees were infected in the USA and 27 employees lost their lives. The average age of infected health employees is 42 [25]. It was reported in printed media that in Spain 5,400, in Germany 2.000 health employees have been infected, while approximately 100 health employees died in England [26,27,28]. In order to prevent the health employees to catch the disease and to remove the possible negative impacts of a longworking period and a stressful working environment, there are many things to be done by the health managers and health politicians. It is thought that it is essential to provide strong communication with the health employees and to analyze their anxiety and stress levels by using proven scientific criteria to take required measures.",
