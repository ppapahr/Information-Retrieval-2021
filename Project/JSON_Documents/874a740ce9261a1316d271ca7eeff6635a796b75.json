The authors wrote that historic trade volume will reflect these non-GDP and non-geographic factors, but isn't it reasonable to assume that trade volume will also be affected by GDP and geographic factors? Assume a country A exports the same volume in a given commodity in 2000 to two different neighboring countries, B and C, both with similar distances, but B having a significantly larger GDP than C. Would this third element, trade relationship, be assigned the same value for that country exporting that commodity, or have different values taking in consideration the difference in GDP between the two trade partners? Shouldn't the trade-relationship element for the export of that commodity from A to C have a higher value than that from A to B in this case? If not corrected, then it would be important to discuss why this wouldn't introduce a significant double-counting type of bias in favor of larger GDP / shorter distances when combining this third element with the previous two.",

In here the reader is left assuming that the ranking and matching process is calibrated somehow to account for trade-offs between the variables mentioned in the paragraph (production and transport costs, willingness to pay, etc...). Does that process take into consideration the effects of the different variables differently? For example, up to which point (quantity?) production costs outweight transport costs in the match-making process? A few sentences in here explaining how such calibration allows the model to reproduce the dynamics of price implicitly would make the argument in this paragraph more convincing. As it is, the argument sounds a bit incomplete: the model includes all the information in the price, but does it do so in a way that emulates the price dynamics sufficiently well? (c) page 12, paragraph starting at lines 15-16. The calibration described here is a valid way of addressing the questions above in an empirical way. As a suggestion, the authors would be able to address both issues above in a relatively short way by adding a sentence at the end of the paragraph at page 11, line 6 stating that the four elements are calibrated with real data, and then a few sentences in each of the two paragraphs I've mentioned before stating how the calibration addresses the issues, namely of the possible double-count bias of the third element (they don't need to be ortogonal, as long as their parameters are calibrated to match observed data), and of the price dynamics (the behavior is calibrated to match the observations, and therefore it should work at least as well as having a price variable explicitly). Regardless of the way they choose to address these questions, I think it would be useful to have it in this section (2.2.2.).",

            "text": "(d) page 13, paragraph starting at line 31. The paragraph does a good job of explaining why the addition of the maximum amount of trade is important, but leaves the reader wondering how this parameter is computed, and what are the uncertainties in the model's behavior caused by its addition. If this is described elsewhere, it is worth pointing it out. If not, it would be important to describe the structure of this parameter (is it a flat value for all countries? does it change over time, or over commodities?), and also to provide some form of sensitivity analysis regarding its parameterization. What would be a reasonable variation of this maximum amount? What would be a good metric to check the impact of such variation? By how much would that metric change under that variation? Could the literature help ground any of these answers? (e) page 13, paragraph starting at line 49. Is the order with which the food categories are traded the same every year? If so, wouldn't it introduce a bias against the consumption of the latter categories in the order, since possibly all the macro and micro nutrients needed by a country could be met by the trade and production of the first categories? Would it be possible to randomize the order the categories are traded from year to year in NetLogo (or perhaps feeding a new randomized order into NetLogo each year)? And if so, can it be used to show that following a fixed order yields no significant difference on the final result? (f) page 14, paragraph starting at line 3. Although the use of the word parameter implies that trade saturation is a quantity that can be set in the model, it is only much later in the text (section 4.1) that this parameter is fixed to different values, and its impact discussed. From this paragraph alone it could also be the case that the authors let the model run until market clearance, saving snapshots of each food category's trade round at fixed saturation values. A few words in here clarifying that saturation is a parameter in the sense that it can be fixed by the model might help some readers understand it more concretely in here, and later help in the reading of section 4.1.",

            "text": "(g) page 18, paragraph starting at lines 44-45. The authors' approach to calibrating their model is sufficient for the scope of the current work. It would be interesting to explore in a future work how the calibrated parameters in table 5 would vary across countries, or at least regions. The significant differences between the mean values in table 18 suggests the general parameterization done presently works better for some regions than some others. Also, the use of two metrics for finding the Pareto tradeoff between them is a valid approach, but it doesn't guarantee that the solutions are matching volume and partner together. The same goes for the validation. In the future the authors might want to consider a single metric defined by number of matches (right partner with a volume difference within the same 20% range) over the total amount of trades. This single metric would allow the authors to pick the best parameterization in the random set of 10,000, or to inform some sort of gradient-descent / markov-chain mechanism, which might even converge before 10,000 runs (particularly if the authors use their current calibration as starting point). For the present work, a few lines discussing how these two caveats, namely lack of parameterization per country, and the uncontrolled correlations between trade volumes and partners, are not an issue for its stated purposes (as in page 6, paragraph starting at line 29) would make section 3.1, and subsequently section 3.2, better.",

If indeed trade saturation is a parameter that can be fixed in the model, the calibration and validation sections don't discussed explicitly to which value it was set for the analyses there. From my reading, currently the model doesn't have an endogenous mechanism that stops trading from happening before market clearance. I understand it is beyond the scope of the current work, but wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that relaxing the constraint of market clearance would allow the model to provide better predictions? If trade saturation is indeed a parameter, why not include it in the calibration process? In other words, it would be important to discuss precisely how trade saturation works in the model, and if it is indeed a fixed parameter, a constraint so to speak, why the choice of 1, or whatever choice was made in the calibration and validation phases, is better than, say 0.5, or a value that yielded the best calibration with the observed data?",

Key challenges that the authors could address include, first, move most of the model development specificities into the appendix. The paper is very long and many readers will not be able to hang on for the ride; try to address, if feasible some of the already identified challenges, such as relating future trade only to history and not to changing trends in diets (linked empirically to changes in incomes and urbanization) in low-income countries, and in high-income countries, to reductions in per capita consumption of some food items, like milk, sugary drinks, and a few other commodities. P 28, lines 26 notes that poor countries are penalized by trade. Other studies have found that poor countries always benefit nutritionally from trade, pretty much regardless of scenario. The results on pages 23-25 could be tightened and presented differently. My black and white printout showed nothing, also which trade saturation picture comes closest to reality? The paper should take a bit more care to adequately differentiate the terms food security and nutrition in the paper even if the 1996 World Food Summit referred to nutritious foods and meeting dietary needs; they are not the same thing. F.ex. Abstract: \"comprehensive nutrition model to investigate\" \"food and nutrition security\"; also page 6: \"Most research on food security has so far focused on energy consumption (calories). However, having sufficient energy does not guarantee a nutritionally adequate diet.\"; page 29, line 3 \"nutrition consumption\"",

The authors wrote that historic trade volume will reflect these non-GDP and non-geographic factors, but isn't it reasonable to assume that trade volume will also be affected by GDP and geographic factors? Assume a country A exports the same volume in a given commodity in 2000 to two different neighboring countries, B and C, both with similar distances, but B having a significantly larger GDP than C. Would this third element, trade relationship, be assigned the same value for that country exporting that commodity, or have different values taking in consideration the difference in GDP between the two trade partners? Shouldn't the trade-relationship element for the export of that commodity from A to C have a higher value than that from A to B in this case? If not corrected, then it would be important to discuss why this wouldn't introduce a significant double-counting type of bias in favor of larger GDP / shorter distances when combining this third element with the previous two.",

In here the reader is left assuming that the ranking and matching process is calibrated somehow to account for trade-offs between the variables mentioned in the paragraph (production and transport costs, willingness to pay, etc...). Does that process take into consideration the effects of the different variables differently? For example, up to which point (quantity?) production costs outweight transport costs in the match-making process? A few sentences in here explaining how such calibration allows the model to reproduce the dynamics of price implicitly would make the argument in this paragraph more convincing. As it is, the argument sounds a bit incomplete: the model includes all the information in the price, but does it do so in a way that emulates the price dynamics sufficiently well? (c) page 12, paragraph starting at lines 15-16. The calibration described here is a valid way of addressing the questions above in an empirical way. As a suggestion, the authors would be able to address both issues above in a relatively short way by adding a sentence at the end of the paragraph at page 11, line 6 stating that the four elements are calibrated with real data, and then a few sentences in each of the two paragraphs I've mentioned before stating how the calibration addresses the issues, namely of the possible double-count bias of the third element (they don't need to be ortogonal, as long as their parameters are calibrated to match observed data), and of the price dynamics (the behavior is calibrated to match the observations, and therefore it should work at least as well as having a price variable explicitly). Regardless of the way they choose to address these questions, I think it would be useful to have it in this section (2.2.2.).",

If this is described elsewhere, it is worth pointing it out. If not, it would be important to describe the structure of this parameter (is it a flat value for all countries? does it change over time, or over commodities?), and also to provide some form of sensitivity analysis regarding its parameterization. What would be a reasonable variation of this maximum amount? What would be a good metric to check the impact of such variation? By how much would that metric change under that variation?

Although the use of the word parameter implies that trade saturation is a quantity that can be set in the model, it is only much later in the text (section 4.1) that this parameter is fixed to different values, and its impact discussed. From this paragraph alone it could also be the case that the authors let the model run until market clearance, saving snapshots of each food category's trade round at fixed saturation values.

It would be interesting to explore in a future work how the calibrated parameters in table 5 would vary across countries, or at least regions. The significant differences between the mean values in table 18 suggests the general parameterization done presently works better for some regions than some others. Also, the use of two metrics for finding the Pareto tradeoff between them is a valid approach, but it doesn't guarantee that the solutions are matching volume and partner together. The same goes for the validation. In the future the authors might want to consider a single metric defined by number of matches (right partner with a volume difference within the same 20% range) over the total amount of trades. This single metric would allow the authors to pick the best parameterization in the random set of 10,000, or to inform some sort of gradient-descent / markov-chain mechanism, which might even converge before 10,000 runs (particularly if the authors use their current calibration as starting point). For the present work, a few lines discussing how these two caveats, namely lack of parameterization per country, and the uncontrolled correlations between trade volumes and partners, are not an issue for its stated purposes (as in page 6, paragraph starting at line 29) would make section 3.1, and subsequently section 3.2, better.",

If indeed trade saturation is a parameter that can be fixed in the model, the calibration and validation sections don't discussed explicitly to which value it was set for the analyses there. From my reading, currently the model doesn't have an endogenous mechanism that stops trading from happening before market clearance. I understand it is beyond the scope of the current work, but wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that relaxing the constraint of market clearance would allow the model to provide better predictions? If trade saturation is indeed a parameter, why not include it in the calibration process? In other words, it would be important to discuss precisely how trade saturation works in the model, and if it is indeed a fixed parameter, a constraint so to speak, why the choice of 1, or whatever choice was made in the calibration and validation phases, is better than, say 0.5, or a value that yielded the best calibration with the observed data?",

Key challenges that the authors could address include, first, move most of the model development specificities into the appendix. The paper is very long and many readers will not be able to hang on for the ride; try to address, if feasible some of the already identified challenges, such as relating future trade only to history and not to changing trends in diets (linked empirically to changes in incomes and urbanization) in low-income countries, and in high-income countries, to reductions in per capita consumption of some food items, like milk, sugary drinks, and a few other commodities. P 28, lines 26 notes that poor countries are penalized by trade. Other studies have found that poor countries always benefit nutritionally from trade, pretty much regardless of scenario. The results on pages 23-25 could be tightened and presented differently. My black and white printout showed nothing, also which trade saturation picture comes closest to reality? The paper should take a bit more care to adequately differentiate the terms food security and nutrition in the paper even if the 1996 World Food Summit referred to nutritious foods and meeting dietary needs; they are not the same thing. F.ex. Abstract: \"comprehensive nutrition model to investigate\" \"food and nutrition security\"; also page 6: \"Most research on food security has so far focused on energy consumption (calories). However, having sufficient energy does not guarantee a nutritionally adequate diet.\"; page 29, line 3 \"nutrition consumption\"",

Assume a country A exports the same volume in a given commodity in 2000 to two different neighboring countries, B and C, both with similar distances, but B having a significantly larger GDP than C. Would this third element, trade relationship, be assigned the same value for that country exporting that commodity, or have different values taking in consideration the difference in GDP between the two trade partners? Shouldn't the trade-relationship element for the export of that commodity from A to C have a higher value than that from A to B in this case?

For example, up to which point (quantity?) production costs outweight transport costs in the match-making process?

If this is described elsewhere, it is worth pointing it out.

If so, wouldn't it introduce a bias against the consumption of the latter categories in the order, since possibly all the macro and micro nutrients needed by a country could be met by the trade and production of the first categories? Would it be possible to randomize the order the categories are traded from year to year in NetLogo (or perhaps feeding a new randomized order into NetLogo each year)? And if so, can it be used to show that following a fixed order yields no significant difference on the final result? The order is the same, however, it should not cause any bias to the results, because the trade of each commodity is independent of each other, and the countries are not trying optimise their nutrient intake. Say, the countries will start from wheat, and then rice, and then vegetables, and meat, and fish etc (there are 91 food commodities that they trade), and each trade decision is made independent of trade decisions of other foods.",

From this paragraph alone it could also be the case that the authors let the model run until market clearance, saving snapshots of each food category's trade round at fixed saturation values.

It would be interesting to explore in a future work how the calibrated parameters in table 5 would vary across countries, or at least regions. The significant differences between the mean values in table 18 suggests the general parameterization done presently works better for some regions than some others. Also, the use of two metrics for finding the Pareto tradeoff between them is a valid approach, but it doesn't guarantee that the solutions are matching volume and partner together. The same goes for the validation. In the future the authors might want to consider a single metric defined by number of matches (right partner with a volume difference within the same 20% range) over the total amount of trades. This single metric would allow the authors to pick the best parameterization in the random set of 10,000, or to inform some sort of gradient-descent / markov-chain mechanism, which might even converge before 10,000 runs (particularly if the authors use their current calibration as starting point). For the present work, a few lines discussing how these two caveats, namely lack of parameterization per country, and the uncontrolled correlations between trade volumes and partners, are not an issue for its stated purposes (as in page 6, paragraph starting at line 29) would make section 3.1, and subsequently section 3.2, better.",

If indeed trade saturation is a parameter that can be fixed in the model, the calibration and validation sections don't discussed explicitly to which value it was set for the analyses there. From my reading, currently the model doesn't have an endogenous mechanism that stops trading from happening before market clearance. I understand it is beyond the scope of the current work, but wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that relaxing the constraint of market clearance would allow the model to provide better predictions? If trade saturation is indeed a parameter, why not include it in the calibration process? In other words, it would be important to discuss precisely how trade saturation works in the model, and if it is indeed a fixed parameter, a constraint so to speak, why the choice of 1, or whatever choice was made in the calibration and validation phases, is better than, say 0.5, or a value that yielded the best calibration with the observed data? 'Trade saturation' is an intervention parameter that we vary in the computer experiment. It is not fixed, and is exogenous to the model. We agree with the reviewer that one way to approach it is to calibrate it with data, and find the optimal value for it that best fit the data. However, unlike the four elements w.r.t trade priority, which are intrinsic values in the model to be calibrated, we believe trade saturation is an intervention parameter, which trade policies and global geopolitics will change. We want to be able to alter its value to see its impact on results. We have included the clarification in section 4.1.",

If that were the case, sorghum, barley and roots and tuber food availability levels would not be changing in Africa and per capita rice consumption would not be declining in Asia (and growing in Africa). Countries do not want to remain in a status quo! Typical diet in 2000 is only used as a baseline, the demand for food each year does change!
