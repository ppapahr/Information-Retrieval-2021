            "text": "To make decisions in dangerous environments we need some way of assessing the risk corresponding to different choices we might make. In the context of an epidemic, or a pandemic, such as COVID-19 there are two points of view that can be considered. The first point of view is that of government which wants to minimise the spread of the disease globally in accord with various objectives, such as ensuring: that fewer vulnerable people get the disease, that the health system is not overwhelmed, essential services can continue to function and, in the long run, that the economy recovers. The second point of view is that of individuals, or small collections of individuals (such as families or groups of friends) who want to minimise their risk of getting COVID-19, and (for the altruistic) minimise their contribution to the global spread of the disease. Individuals also want to be able to use essential services, and look after their economic wellbeing. Given sufficient assistance, individuals and small groups of individuals are capable of quite complex decision making behaviours to navigate dangerous situations. For example, a large percentage of the population can drive, and even those that cannot are, by and large, capable of behaving safely around vehicles. Physical (social) distancing measures that are typically considered are rather coarse-grained [43] . Examples include closing schools, asking people to go for only one walk per day, implementing a work from home policy, etc. Such policies are appropriate when we are in a near lock-down state. It would be good if government had its hands on \"levers\" enabling them to transition smoothly from lock-down to full-liberty state where people can move around as they wish (once the disease has ceased to be a concern). The proposal in this paper would allow this smooth transition harnessing the ability and intent of individuals to navigate the dangers of a pandemic by putting in place a framework individuals could use to make informed decisions concerning the risks associated with different actions. Further, this framework could be integrated with government objectives.",

This app would allow people to view, in advance, the risks associated with different choices (such as whether to go to a particular cafe or not). It does this by calculating a cost in terms of points. Each point corresponds to a probability increment, p point , for getting infected with the disease. Government can set a certain recommended number of points per day, per week or per fortnight for individuals (this may depend on various factors such as age and underlying health conditions). The points costs associated with the actual activities a person engages in are tallied. This is rather like counting calories. There are numerous venues where people can interact such as a dwelling, a workplace, the gym, or a supermarket. Venues could be managed or unmanaged. For managed venues there is a nominated person who would be tasked with entering information into an installation of the app, perhaps with the objective of keeping the rate at which transmission of the disease occurs at that venue is below some recommended maximum.",

            "text": "In Part II of this paper I will put in place a mathematical framework for doing quantitative calculations based on the information collected by the app. This will be a circuit framework consisting of boxes with systems passing between them (the mathematics is borrowed from work done in Quantum Foundations [19, 18, 8, 9] ). Here is an example of a small fragment of a circuit describing the behaviour of three individuals visiting two venues (1) Time runs up the page. This shows how individual 7 visits arrives at venue 43, leaves to visit venue 27 then returns to venue 43 before finally leaving. Meanwhile, individuals 23 and 18 arrive at venue 43 at different times and leave at different times. This diagram is descriptive but it can be used to obtain a mathematical object, namely a tensor which captures the pertinent probabilities of the individuals and the venues transitioning between internal states (hidden variables) as they interact. The key aspect of this map from the descriptive to the mathematical is that it preserves the compositional form -calculations can be represented in diagrammatic form by pictures having the same composition as the descriptive pictures. Ideally, every system is maintained by data entry into an installation of the app though we can also accommodate unmanaged systems in the framework. The systems correspond to individual people (e.g. individuals a 7 and a 18 using the app and individual b 23 not using it) and to venues (e.g. x 43 managed by the app and unmanaged venue y 27 ). Examples of a venue are a family home, a cafe, a sidewalk, a work place, a supermarket. . . . The boxes correspond to social interactions (meeting a friend for coffee in a cafe, going to work, a visit to the supermarket. . . ). I will consider strategies for using this mathematical framework to inform the points costs for different social activities. Symptoms and positive or negative test results for the disease can be entered using the app interface. Using this mathematical framework, the app can provide the user with an ongoing report of the probability they have contracted the disease. This probability typically will be low if the user has stuck to the recommended points allocation, though if somebody they have come into contact with subsequently reports symptoms or a positive test result, their probability will increase. In this way, the framework can accomplish what might be termed probabilistic contact tracing. People with probability of infection above some threshold can be asked to self-isolate. It will cost more points to interact with people who have spent more points (who typically have a higher probability of having contracted the disease even if they fall below the threshold at which people are instructed to self isolate) and it is posited that this will help suppress spread of the disease.",

Should we use the fine-grained probability or the \"coarse-grained\" probability (determined from behaviour) when we calculate the number of points it costs to visit a venue? Since we are endeavouring to provide people with a behavioural framework which influences the way they make choices, it is better to base the number of points on the coarse-grained probabilities based on behaviours (which people have control over).

Costs for such visits could be calculated from generic cost functions for such types of venue. This kind of approach would be well suited to spacious outdoor spaces. For example, the cost for a picnic with a friend in a park would depend on the recent activity of that friend and be calculated by some function taking into account that this is an outdoor space.

The app lets the user know the predicted costs beforehand. Then the app charges the user the actual cost after their visit (so this is subtracted from the recommended daily (or weekly) number of points). The app, further, allows reporting of the finegrained probability to the user and updates this fine-grained probability when new information becomes available. If this updated fine-grained probability rises above various threshold values then various policies may be implemented. Possible policies associated with different thresholds are (i) reduction of allocated points allowance, (ii) increase in coefficients that determine the costs for others to interact with this individual, and (iii) the user is asked to self-isolate. It is worth noting that subsequent information may be made available that may reduce the updated probability. This could happen if, for example, some other person, m, reports that they are infected causing individual n's probability to go up. But then another person, m \u2032 , could report they are infected suggesting a different pathway to m having become infected so that individual n's probability will go down again. In such a circumstance, an instruction to self-isolate could be retracted. If calculations are done properly then the actual cost multiplied by p points should equal the average of the fine-grained probability for visits to the venue. If this is not the case, there is a problem with the model and we could adjust the parameters by which the actual cost is calculated. This could be implemented by a machine learning algorithm. Further information that might be incorporated into a machine learning algorithm could come from reports of symptoms and test results that relate to the given venue.

Individuals are, at all times, in some place (home, a cafe, work, the park, . . . ) which we call venues. We label venues by v = 1, 2, . . . . We will consider direct and indirect infection. Indirect infection is where one person leaves pathogens behind at a venue (for example, on a surface, in some food, or lingering in the air) and these infect another person at a later time. Direct infection is when one person releases pathogens which impinge on the other person more or less immediately (for example, by hand shaking or coughing).

Imagine venue 39 is a store. Individual 7 arrives through the entrance door at a certain time. He then wanders around the store. At the intermediate time associated with the change from the first box to the second, he may be anywhere. Later still, he pays and leaves by the exit door. His behaviour is described by a probability over various random walks through the store which does not factorize into separate probability distributions over the two time intervals.

There are other technologies, such as using WiFi signals as radar to detect peoples position [22, 46] that may find application to disease control. There are, of course, ethical considerations at play here if this is non-consensual. We will consider the Bluetooth example here but our notation will apply to other tracking technologies. If some of the visitors to a venue have Bluetooth tracking enabled then we will be able to collect additional information that goes beyond the behaviours those individuals have chosen. For example, individual 7 may choose a behaviour whereby they go to a supermarket at a certain time take a basket rather than a trolley and spend 30 to 35 minutes shopping. It would be difficult to be more prescriptive than this in choosing a behaviour. There are many trajectories around the supermarket consistent with this behaviour. Bluetooth can provide fine-grained information on these other trajectories and, in particular, how proximate the individual is with other shoppers who have enabled Bluetooth tracking. We take this additional information to be an outcome rather than a setting they choose (because it is unreasonable to expect individuals to decide on such prescribed trajectories).",

As currently implemented it is a rather blunt tool consisting of general advice and directives to the entire population. Physical distancing brings its own considerable risks however. First, it is not mentally healthy for people to be isolated from friends and taken out of their regular habits. With such large numbers of people affected, this could take its own toll [40] . Second, it impedes the regular functioning of society. This affects the provision of essential services during the crisis itself. It also affects the longer term economic health of society with potential knock-on effects that may be enormous in the fullness of time [10, 37, 28] . When these considerations are taken into account, the total death toll of too strong a physical distancing policy could be comparable to that due to COVID-19. There is a need, then, to enable people to find way for people to interact to as great an extent as possible while stemming the spread of the disease. In this paper I have described a way for people to make decisions in an epidemic to reduce their exposure and that of others. There are many challenges on the way to implementing this idea.",

Consider the case where some fraction, \u03b1, of people and some fraction, \u03b2, of venues participate.

This will depend what stage the disease is expected to have developed to in the interim. A fraction of the population will not use the app. In the case that such people can be identified and their behaviour modeled, they can be treated by allocating a value S m = kc(t) (35) to such individuals (as used in (31)) where the constant k is greater than or equal to 1 and c(t) is the fraction c(t) 1 p point upper estimate of number of people infected at time t population (36) This approach would treat individuals not using the app as presenting a greater risk than those that do. Some venues may only admit people who track using the app so they can keep the infection rate for their venue below a certain recommended value. In (32) we added costs. This is justified under certain circumstances. Consider an individual who goes to the cafe, then to the supermarket, then to the bank. Let the corresponding probabilities of infection for each of these stops be p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 respectively. If each of these three chances of infection are uncorrelated then the probability of not being infected is (1 \u2212 p 1 )(1 \u2212 p 2 )(1 \u2212 p 3 ). Hence Prob of infection = 1\u2212(1\u2212p 1 )(1\u2212p 2 )(1\u2212p 3 ) \u2248 p 1 +p 2 +p 3 for p 1 , p 2 , p 3 << 1 (37) This means there is a linear regime when probabilities are small and the risks are uncorrelated. If the probability of infection is large enough or if the situations are correlated then we cannot simply add probabilities. In this regime, the total cost associated with these activities total cost = c 1 + c 2 + c 3 where c i = p i p point (38) is approximately proportional to the probability of infection. We will provide a simple framework for calculating the probabilities p i so that costs can be calculated.",

However, both these assumptions will break down. Probabilities will become big if somebody is showing symptoms or has a positive test result. Probabilities will necessarily become correlated through the complex pattern of interactions of people with each other One source of error in the formula (31) is double counting. For example, if Alice and Bob had met several days earlier in a restaurant then there would be a contribution to Bob's total, S 2 , from having met Alice. This, in turn, contributes to Alice's cost when she meets Bob at the cafe. This means we have a contribution for Alice infecting herself. If being infected with the disease infers immunity over the timescale we are looking at then this cannot happen. Either Alice is still infected in which case she cannot be reinfected. Or she is recovered in which case she cannot be reinfected. We could consider tweaking the above formulae to remove such contributions taking into account previous interactions. One way to tweak is to go back and look at each of the c jm m 's appearing in (32) (or (34) ) and see if the visit j m involved Alice. If it did, then the calculation of c jm m can be redone setting the appropriate \u03b2 v \u2032 u1um to zero where v \u2032 is the venue for visit j m . Call this redone (or tweaked) value c jm m 1 (where the 1 refers to Alice). We can then redo the calculations of S m using c jm m 1 instead of c jm m and obtain the tweaked value S m 1 .

We are taking a simplified approach here by assuming that C and S are each represented by a single number (and an integer at that) rather than being represented by a vector. A more detailed model might require that some of these quantities are modeled by vectors. For example, the degree of contagiousness of an individual might be different through different channels (coughing, sweat deposits, . . . ) and these different degrees of contagiousness could be represented by different components of a vector. Should the vectorial aspect of these quantities be essential in the modeling, we could easily adapt approach above so that each component of the vectors is discretized (indeed, we do this below for the contagiousness of a venue). We may want to include more quantities. For example, the quantity T (a n ), equal to the number of days since initial infection (set equal to \u22121 for the uninfected), might help modeling the development of the disease.

Let c jn n be the cost to person n for their j n th visit to a venue since they started tracking. In the simplified approach to calculating the cost for Alice for this cafe lunch with Bob is as followswhere the visit to the cafe is her j 1 th visit to a venue, \u2206t 1 is the duration of Alice's visit, and where V v is the set of all visitors except Alice either present during Alice's visit or who have visited sufficiently recently that they may have left pathogen deposits there that are still active during Alice's visit. The set V v includes Bob and the people working at the cafe. Also, we defineis the sum of the costs of previous visits to venues that individual m made during such a time that they may have been infected and now be infectious (to Alice). The label, u m , indicates the behaviour of individual m at the cafe (such as sitting at table number 4 from 1pm to 1:30pm). The coefficients \u03b2 v u1um are weighted according to the risks posed at venue v to Alice. These coefficients will depend on various factors such as the layout of the cafe, how well ventilated it is, and cleaning procedures.The calculation for the cost for Alice in (31) includes a contribution, \u03b2 v u1u2 S m , from her interaction with Bob. Since Bob will be sitting at the same table, the \u03b2 v u1um coefficient is likely bigger than the contributions from other people at the cafe and so Alice will care more about S 2 for Bob.When user m first begins using the app there is some probability going in that they have the disease. We represent this assuming that they have already accrued a certain cost, c 0 m . This cost is included in the sum in (32) if they have",
