The old age is an independent factor for the COVID-19-related death (RR = 9.45) (Zhao et al., 2020) . This pandemic might affect this population's mental health. Retrospective studies of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic demonstrated that suicide rates raised among elderly during this period (Kluge, 2020) .

With civil society support, it has been possible to provide personal hygiene and safety products, such as soaps, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels and fabric masks. All individuals received product cleaning and reuse guidance. In the first week of the influenza vaccine campaign, all the elderly assisted were vaccinated to minimize H1N1 flu syndrome.

Of 6,984 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 148 deaths (Norwegian Institute of Public Health, 2020), '1,599 people were infected abroad and 3,439 were infected locally within Norway. All institutions that treated or performed elderly patients' care have faced challenges and have taken actions. Both home-dwelling and nursing home residents were deeply affected. Many older persons living at home have become more isolated. At first, many have been afraid of being contaminated by COVID-19 and many have avoided going outside. Besides, all the activities have been suspended in this period, such as physical activities, social activities and physiotherapy. They have also avoided meeting family members, especially children and grandchildren, which increased the isolation. Homecare nurses have focused on good hand hygiene, maintaining social distance when possible and prioritizing visits. The unnecessary visits were suspended. Some measurements were taken to minimize the negative isolation consequences by promoting contact with family members by telephone or videocalls, performing active listening and talking about pleasurable themes when they were intensively worried (Goyal, 2020) .",

Those with severe dementia might not understand the situation, but still, persons with dementia are more vulnerable to develop symptoms such as anxiety, depression and agitation. This can be triggered by situations they do not understand, like the daily routine changes powered by COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, nursing homes in Norway have focused in maintaining daily routines, activities and especially measurements that stimulated pleasure. Many nursing homes have also offered contact with residents' relatives through videocalls, and there has been positive feedback from both residents and relatives. Some relatives have also had contact with residents through glass walls or windows combined with telephone calls. A possible consequence of the suspension of routine physical activities and physiotherapy is the worsening of daily living function. Professionals have therefore tried to create not only other types of activities, physical activities but also social and cognitive stimulation. Another issue that might be frightening to the infected patients is to meet the professionals wearing infection control equipment. Consequently, this group needed to have contact with relatives through a screen or window.",
