In this goal, we separate the total cases into fourteen groups for the corresponding fourteen incubation periods. The estimated mean incubation period we obtain is 6.74 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 6.35 to 7.13), and the 90th percentile is 11.64 days (95% CI: 11.22 to 12.17), corresponding to a good agreement with statistical supported studies. This model provides an almost zero-cost approach to estimate the incubation period. : medRxiv preprint NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice. cer etc., and older people are vulnerable to severe complications and death from coronavirus, although we are discovering new features of COVID-19 every day. In the absence of vaccination and proper medication, we can merely obey some non-pharmaceutical containments, lockdown, social distancing, hand hygiene, face masking, mobile app to trace corona-positive individuals, to help prevent the spread of the this infectious disease. To minimize transmission of the virus through human-to-human interaction, quarantine of individuals with exposure to infectious pathogen is an effective strategy for containing contagious diseases. To govern a quarantine period for asymptomatic as well as presymptomatic individuals, it is essential to fully estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 disease.",

Using the proposed model and publicly available data of confirmed cases, one could accurately estimate the incubation period in any region. We obtain the distribution of the incubation period from the population, so that it is better than any sample-dependent result. We have considered fourteen delays, but it is possible to consider an arbitrary number of delays. After estimating the model parameters, one can estimate the incubation period of confirmed cases over a long period, over a small time interval, and even over a single day. The present approach 15 .

For the incubation period an oscillatory behaviour is observed. The descending pattern for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 5 and the ascending order for 7 \u2264 i \u2264 9 and 11 \u2264 i \u2264 14 indicate that the mean incubation period is rising.
