Perceived stressors and coping strategies were also explored. Methods A cross-sectional study on 714 physicians was carried out using an online administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, data related to the current pandemic, Kessler psychological distress scale, and the brief resilient coping scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors. Results About 50% of physicians had severe psychological distress. Among studied physicians, the significant predictors were being female, having a pre-existing illness, having an elderly family member, and being in close contact with a case (AOR 1.6, 1.6, 1.4 and 1.7, respectively). Meanwhile, significant occupational predictors were less experienced and frontline physicians (AOR 2.0 and 1.8, respectively). The most distressful concern was fear for families and personal health and safety, while religious coping was the most effective coping strategy. Conclusion During the current pandemic, Egyptian physicians have a high prevalence of psychological distress. Frontline, low-experienced, female, previously ill physicians are more likely to have severe psychological distress. Therefore, psychological preparedness and psychological support services should be implemented and made easily accessible during pandemics.",

The total score was interpreted as follows: well (10-19), mild distress (20-24), moderate distress (25-29), and severe distress (30-50) (Andrews and Slade 2001) . K10 has excellent internal consistency and reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) (Kessler et al. 2002) . 6. Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS): A 4-item measure designed to capture tendencies to cope with stress in a highly adaptive manner. It is useful for identifying individuals in need of interventions aimed to develop resilient coping skills. The items have a five options response format, where 1 = \"does not describe you at all\", 2 = \"does not describe me\", 3 = \"neutral\", 4 = \"describes me\", and 5 = \"it describes you very well\". The total score ranges from 4 to 20, which is interpreted as follows: low-resilient copers (4-13), medium-resilient copers (14-16), and high resilient copers (17-20). The BRCS had adequate internal consistency and reliability estimated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.76 (Sinclair and Wallston 2004).",

The reported possible risk factors were in line with the results of the current study. Female gender, younger age, fewer years of experience, being a frontline HCWs, being previously infected, and fear of transmitting the infection to the family were the predictors of PTSS and PTSD. At the same time, active coping was reported as an effective resilience strategy that can mitigate distress and reduce PTSS. Targeting such factors in intervention strategies can prevent adverse mental health outcomes (Carmassi et al. 2020) .",

First is the inability to recruit a genuinely random sample that is representative of Egyptian physicians. Second, only physicians who happen to be online at the time of data collection can participate. Third, self-selection bias is a significant limitation of online data collection. Fourth, systematic bias due to some physicians' tendency to accept the invitation to participate in an online study, while others ignore it. These sampling problems inhibit researchers' ability to generalize study results. Finally, the response rate cannot be calculated as the target population is unknown.",

Among studied physicians, the main sociodemographic predictors of severe psychological distress were being female, having a pre-existing illness, having an elderly family member, and being in close contact with a case. Meanwhile, significant occupational predictors were less experience and being a frontline physician. The most distressful concern was fear for families and personal health and safety, while religious coping was the most effective coping strategy.",

Then, psychological, and mental health services (available resources, support, and intervention) should be provided to health professionals emphasizing the importance of emotional support from colleagues, family, and friends. HCWs should receive regular screening for psychological distress, and timely counseling or psychotherapy should be provided for those in need. Considering a 'resilience training' program based on different psychotherapeutic approaches that consider modifiable resilience factors can improve resilience and reduce depression and stress symptoms. Implementing strict infection control procedures and adequate protective equipment supplies in hospitals may help lower personal safety concerns. Unique and tailored arrangements should also be made for individuals with pre-existing illnesses. Psychological preparedness should be integrated into the overall public health responses to pandemics. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the long-term psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic.",
