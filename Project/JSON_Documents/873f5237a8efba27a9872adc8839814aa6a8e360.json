Indeed, as symbolic execution actually follows all paths in the program, it does not terminate if the program contains an unbounded loop or an infinite path (unless an error is found). Even when the number of paths is finite and all the paths are finite, symbolic execution usually runs out of resources if the number of paths is large. Although this problem is slightly alleviated by program slicing, our tool still does not scale well on complex programs. \u2022 --prp=file, which sets the property specification file to use, \u2022 --witness=file, which sets the output file for the witness,",
