            "text": "Reviewer #1: Remarks to the Author: Wang and colleagues present two mAbs that (MW05 and MW07) have neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and does not cross-react with the S of SARS-CoV-1. Using an assay to measure ADE, they found that only MW05 can mediate internalization of pseudoparticles only in Raji cells and not in K562 or THP-1 cells. Further investigation find that FcgRIIB appears to be the determinant for Fc-Fc\uf067R dependent internalization of Raji cells. Of note, there is some concern over Fc\uf067R expression in THP-1 cells (discussed below). In vivo efficacy was validated in macaques where protection was found in both pre-and post-exposure prophylactic settings. A lot of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have already been published describing and the addition of two RBDspecific mAbs arguably adds little to the field. The idea of using cell lines to describe ADE is suggestive at best and may not reflect what may actually happen in nature. However, this should not be counted too much against the authors since the use of Raji cells have been used in CoV research. Of note, even in Raji cells SARS-CoV-1 replication was abortive (PMC3187504), meaning that while there is enhancement of entry, this mechanism did not lead to more viral progeny being made. This is in contrast to dengue virus, where it can replicate in Fc\uf067R-bearing cells and thus enhance disease to due increase viral replication. The finding that Fc\uf067RIIB mediated infection should be further discussed and authors should temper what this actually means in nature. In the dengue virus field, FcgRIIB has actually been demonstrated to inhibit ADE of infection (PMC3145677, PMC4673539). The strength of this paper is the finding that they have two mAbs that can differentially engage FcR and that protection was validated in non-human primates. Specifically, the authors should focus on why they have 2 mAbs that can or cannot engage FcRs -this can significantly educate this nascent field. We currently do not know what are the determinants of ADE in SARS-CoV-2. It would be highly encouraging if the epitopes can be elucidated of these two mAbs as they can provide some clues as to the structural basis of the ADE phenomenon.",

Overall the paper is well organized and addresses the urgent need for medical countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro characterization of the antibodies was complete and explained well. The authors went as far as to address the antibody-dependent enhancement seen in the use of some antibody therapies. My main concern with the paper is the NHP efficacy study. Animals we treated with antibody 24 h before or 24 h after challenge constituting prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups. The authors suggest the antibody is protective based on n=3 NHPs clearance of virus RNA in oropharyngeal swab at day 4 and no viral RNA above the level of detection in the prophylactic group. The differences in histopathology are based on an n=1 at days 6 and 7 post-challenge. The authors should discuss the limitations of this study and how it relates to similar work from other groups.",

The researchers don't show any viral data on lower respiratory tract, such as bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal washes during the live phase of the study. Were such samples not collected, or did they not give the desired results? In addition, at time of necropsy, even the control animals had no detectable viral RNA in lung tissues by RT-PCR, which is surprising considering that there is much virus in the trachea and bronchi, and that there also still histopathology. What was the limit of detection for the tissue RT-PCR methodology, as that is not mentioned in the manuscript. \u2022 Figure 4 . Did the authors use a scoring system for the gross pathology and histopathology? From other studies, it is known that even in SARS-CoV-2 infected control animals, the lesions are often spotty, as many regions may still be normal. How detailed and how systematic was the analysis performed to assure that all groups are evaluated the same way and the comparison is valid. , so it should be updated. \u2022 As both MW05 and MW07 look promising in vitro, I am curious why the investigators selected MW05 for further development, especially as based on the in vitro data (Fig 3) , MW07 didn't have any detectable ADE effects. Can the authors mention the reason? \u2022 Line 118: Instead of \"incubation\", a better word would be \"inoculation\". \u2022 Line 124: the text says that the controls received antibody 1 day post-inoculation, but the legend of figure 4 mentions it was given 1 day before virus inoculation. Please verify and correct. \u2022 Line 140: The authors mention \"cellulose\". Do they mean a cellular reaction? \u2022 The histology pictures in Figure 4 are too low resolution to interpret. \u2022 Line 149 mentions detection of antigen in the lung tissue of the control group on day 5, but according to the rest of the manuscript, animals were euthanized either on day 6 or 7, so this is confusing. In Figure 4F , it is also not clear whether each panel presents the data on a single animal.",

Overall the paper is well organized and addresses the urgent need for medical countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro characterization of the antibodies was complete and explained well. The authors went as far as to address the antibody-dependent enhancement seen in the use of some antibody therapies. My main concern with the paper is the NHP efficacy study. Animals we treated with antibody 24 h before or 24 h after challenge constituting prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups. The authors suggest the antibody is protective based on n=3 NHPs clearance of virus RNA in oropharyngeal swab at day 4 and no viral RNA above the level of detection in the prophylactic group. The differences in histopathology are based on an n=1 at days 6 and 7 post-challenge. The authors should discuss the limitations of this study and how it relates to similar work from other groups.",

Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease are still being developed. No single model has emerged as being more relevant for human diseases. By now, rhesus macaques model is the best animal model to mimic various settings of human infection. The rhesus macaques model is widely used to assess efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines of SARS-CoV-2. In terms of the viral loads in respiratory samples, especially for throat swabs, the viral loads reached to about 10 6.0 to 10 7.0 copies/ml at day 2 post infection. Then, viral loads started to drop at day 5 post infection. Low level of viral RNAs were detected from rectal swabs of some monkeys in control group. No viral RNAs were detected from blood samples of all animals. No significant body temperature and body weight changes were observed. These data is in line with Munster's publication. For the nasal swabs, high viral load could be detected from Munster's paper mainly due to the combination inoculation route of intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular. Pathology data in our study is also in line with previous studies. Animals in the control group showed evidence of lung injury by interstitial pneumonia, infiltration of mononuclear cells in the septa and perivascular space. As for the protection provided by vaccination (Doremalen et al. 2020 Nature), viral gRNAs were detected in nose swabs from all animals and no difference was found on any day between vaccinated animals and control animals. Viral RNAs were detected in a minority of animals, with no difference between groups. While in our study, almost no viral RNAs were detected in MW05/LALA prophylactic group. In the control group, the viral loads reached to about 10 6.1 copies/ml at day 2 and last to day 4 before dropping. For the viral RNA loads in lung tissues, viral RNAs were detected in 2 out of 6 animals in the prime-boost vaccinated group. While, no viral RNAs were detected in any lung tissues of MW05/LALA prophylactic animals.The authors should discuss the limitations of the efficacy data, mainly the limited number of animals.",

We have added more information about the animal study in the Methods section.Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):The authors describe the preclinical development of a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody MW05, which was modified via a LALA mutation in the Fc portion to remove any ADE activity. They tested MW05/LALA both in a prophylactic as well as therapeutic setting in rhesus macaques. The authors provide interesting findings that are of high interest to the field. But I have a number of concerns, as expressed in my comments below, that need to be addressed.Major comments: \u2022 It is very surprising that the investigators, while able to find viral RNA in oropharyngeal swabs, and to a lesser extent rectal swabs, they were not able to find viral RNA in nasal swabs, although this is perhaps because they inoculated virus intratracheally. The researchers don't show any viral data on lower respiratory tract, such as bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal washes during the live phase of the study. Were such samples not collected, or did they not give the desired results? In addition, at time of necropsy, even the control animals had no detectable viral RNA in lung tissues by RT-PCR, which is surprising considering that there is much virus in the trachea and bronchi, and that there also still histopathology. What was the limit of detection for the tissue RT-PCR methodology, as that is not mentioned in the manuscript.",

            "text": "We appreciate reviewer's comments and deep insights. We share the same opinion with reviewer about the positive oropharyngeal swabs and \"kind of negative\" nasal swabs. And we are also curious about this phenotype. The possible reason is due to the infection route. The viral RNA can always be detected from trachea and bronchus. The throat is physically close to the trachea. The virus could establish on-site replication in the throat while the nose still has the physical distance with trachea and the minor virus from breath cannot establish the on-site replication in the nose. This may cause the negative results from nasal swabs. Sorry, we regret that we didn't take fluid from either bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal washes. The limit of detection for the tissues is between 10 3 to 10 4 copies/g based on the difference of the tissue weight. We have added this information in figure legend.\u2022 Figure 4 . Did the authors use a scoring system for the gross pathology and histopathology? From other studies, it is known that even in SARS-CoV-2 infected control animals, the lesions are often spotty, as many regions may still be normal.

The scoring system: 1. A semi-quantitative score was performed based on the pathological level, including the thickness of the alveolar wall, the number of inflammatory cell infiltration, the alveolar cavity fibrosis and the inflammatory cells number and the degree of small bronchial disease. The scope of above pathological area was also evaluated. If the area is between 1% to 20%, it is mild level; the moderate level is between 21% to 50%; if the area is more than 50%, it will be defined as severe level. 2.
