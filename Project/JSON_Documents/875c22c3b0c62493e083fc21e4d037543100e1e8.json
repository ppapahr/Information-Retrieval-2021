These changes in 233 nasopharyngeal community composition are subtle, meaning that they are restricted to few 234 taxa out of the complete meta-community. Nevertheless, there are detectable and significant 235 changes among OTU abundances. These changes could be linked to the different severity 236 groups, as we identified both taxa that were present exclusively among COVID-19 positive 237 patients as well as those whose abundance was significantly higher or lower among different 238 severity groups. Not only this, but also the complexity of co-abundance networks (which can 239 be taken as a proxy for potential interactions between taxa), was decreased among patients 240 that developed more severe cases of COVID-19.

Another important limitation is the fact that we 307 performed amplicon rather than whole genome shotgun sequencing. This leads to three 308 issues. First, some of the bacterial diversity is lost due to the fact that the selected primers do 309 not amplify the entirety of bacterial diversity. Second, some genomes have more than a single 310 copy of the 16S operon, which can lead to an overestimation of their abundance in the 311 samples. Third, without metagenomes (and metagenome assembled genomes) we could not 312 make inferences about the presence of virulence factors and other features of the genomes 313 of the microbes in our samples.

Briefly, the sequence spanning the hypervariable regions V3 and V4 130 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified through PCR and amplicons were quantified using a Qubit 131 4 Fluorometer (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit) and validated by 4200 TapeStation (company). 132 Amplicons were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq System using the 2x300bp cartridge.

Sequences 136 were trimmed using trimmomatic [12] and the resulting paired reads were merged using 137 casper [13], generating individual fragments of about 460 bp. Given the uneven coverage 138 between samples, the number of individual reads was standardized to 20,000 per sample, 139 removing samples that did not reach this sequencing depth. Merged amplicon sequences 140 were grouped in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using cd-hit [14] with an identity of 97%. 141 Sequences were queried against small subunits (16S) rRNA genes by the SILVA database [15] 142",

In the network of severity group 1, OTU 16 224 (Prevotella, associated with severity in two GLMs) displayed 18 co-abundant OTUs connected 225 in the network in first degree (Figure 2). Among these connections, ten were negative 226 associations while eight were positive. Most of these connections with OTU 16 were absent 227 from networks of severity groups 2 and 3. Only 3 and 2 first degree connections remained in 228 each of these networks respectively (Figure S3). 229 230 DISCUSSION 231",

            "text": "248The genus Prevotella is usually considered commensal and, as such, rarely involved in 249infections. However, some strains have been identified as opportunistic pathogens in chronic250 infections, abscesses and anaerobic pneumonia [20,21,22,23]. The role of some strains of 251 Prevotella in chronic mucosal inflammation has been demonstrated. They are involved with 252 augmented T helper type 17 (Th17)-mediated mucosal inflammation, through activation of 253 Toll-like receptor 2, followed by production of cytokines by antigen-presenting cells, including 254 interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-1 [23]. The severe symptoms of COVID-19 are associated with 255 cytokine storms, many of which are involved in TH17 type responses [24]. The significant 256 association of Prevotella sp. and disease severity observed here suggests a possible link 257 between Prevotella sp. and the COVID-19 through the activation of immunity signaling 258 pathways that modulate inflammation, and this link should be further explored. 259 260 Reduced network complexity among patients who later developed more severe COVID-19. 261 Several studies demonstrated the usefulness of co-abundance networks to elucidate changes 262 in the microbiome associated with human diseases [26,27,28,29]. By switching from 12 individual OTU associations to a community interaction approach it is possible to attain a 264 better understanding of the dynamic of microbiome/phenotype associations, revealing 265 microbial consortia (and not only an OTU) that might be collectively influencing the host 266 phenotype. Our linear models showed OTU 16 (Prevotella sp.) as an important OTU associated 267 with severity. This OTU had the highest number of connections in the network, followed by 268 OTU 9 (Veillonella sp.). Of the four networks generated, the severity group 1 network showed 269 the higher number of interactions with this OTU. Ecological networking, in vitro and clinical 270 studies showed that Prevotella sp. and Veillonella sp. are keystone species in microbiomes 271 during airway disease progression, especially in diseases associated with mucus accumulation 272 such as cystic fibrosis [30-32]. These anaerobes are efficient at degrading mucin molecules on 273 the airway mucosa, releasing byproducts that enable the colonization and growth of 274 pathogenic bacteria that are poor at degrading mucus for growth [33]. In COVID patients, 275 Prevotella sp. and Veillonella sp. could have a similar role due to the decreased mucociliary 276 clearance caused by the viral infection [34]. Lower rates of clearing increase the residence 277 time of Prevotella sp. and Veillonella sp. in the airways, likely increasing their mucus 278 metabolism and enabling further colonization by pathogenic bacteria that may cause 279 pneumonia. 280 OTU 96, classified as Dolosigranulum sp., was identified in the group 1 network by having a 281 negative relationship with OTU 16 (Prevotella sp.) as first-degree neighbor (Figure 3). OTU 96 282 did not pass the q-value threshold established for the GLMs but shows significant p-value 283 (0.003 in the model comparing group 2 and group 0, and 0.02 in the model comparing group 284 2 and group 1 as reference). The only species currently described in this genus is 285 Dolosigranulum pigrum, which is commonly found in the nasopharynx microbiome and is 286 predicted to benefit the host through protection against pneumococcal colonization [35-36] 287and through protection against inflammation damage[37]. One study also found a lower 288 abundance of Dolosigranulum in children with Influenza A Virus compared to healthy children 289[38]. In addition, a study reported that patients with their airway microbiota dominated by 290Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum experienced the lowest rates of early loss of asthma 291 control and have a longer time to develop at least 2 episodes [39]. We did not identify 292",
