            "text": "For all reported potential donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, CDC, OPO, or transplant center staff reviewed medical records of donors and recipients, including SARS-CoV-2 testing and chest imaging reports. The donor clinical history was reviewed to look for evidence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath. OPO staff asked donor next of kin if the donor had been exposed to someone who had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Additional information included whether the donor had contact with any sick persons or any travel in the 2 weeks prior to death. Recipients who initially tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and triggered a notification to the OPTN of a potential donor-derived transmission were referred to as index recipients, and recipients who shared a common donor with index recipients are referred to as co-recipients. CDC investigators asked OPO and index recipient hospital staff if nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had occurred in donor or recipient hospitals. CDC investigators collected information from transplant centers and OPOs about potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for index recipients during the 14 days before symptom onset, including contact with persons with fever or respiratory symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, travel, and hospitalization prior to admission for the transplant procedure.",
