At present, we do not have a good understanding of general practitioners' (GPs) current management of BPSD. Aims To explore the knowledge, attitudes, and opinions of GPs regarding the prescribing of psychoactive drugs in managing BPSD. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was adapted from a previous study and piloted with three GPs and was posted to a census sample of all GPs working in counties Cork and Kerry, Ireland. We collected and analysed both quantitative and qualitative data. Results Of the 456 eligible GPs who received the questionnaire, 168 GPs returned completed questionnaires (response rate 36.8%). All respondents (100%, 168/168) believed that antipsychotics did not benefit all patients with BPSD. The majority of GPs (69%, 116/168) routinely recommended non-pharmacological interventions before medication to manage BPSD. Most GPs (60.7%, 102/168) welcomed more training and experience to improve their management of BPSD. The qualitative comments provided by GPs described a pressure to prescribe from nursing home staff. GPs highlighted that the management of BPSD is difficult in daily practice and felt that antipsychotics still have a role to play. Conclusions This study identified several factors influencing the prescription of antipsychotics for patients with BPSD as well as the prescribing dilemmas faced by GPs in their daily practice. These findings can be used to guide future interventions aimed at reducing inappropriate prescribing in dementia care.",

            "text": "In 2017, 50 million people were living with dementia, a figure which is expected to rise to 152 million people by 2050 [1] . Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to non-cognitive symptoms that affect up to 90% of patients with dementia [2] . The behavioural symptoms include agitation, physical aggression, loud vocalisation, wandering and restlessness, whereas the psychological symptoms include anxiety, depressive mood, hallucinations and delusions [3] . Those symptoms are frequently very troubling and disabling for patients, can be a burden for their caregivers and are a recognised trigger for admission to nursing homes [4] . BPSD can have many potential causes and triggers. The Unmet Needs Model postulates that BPSD results from unmet needs [5] . The model stems from the concept that a person with dementia may be unable to either identify their needs or Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02356-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. communicate their needs verbally. As a result, they may react to situations with behaviour that is disturbing to others. Identifying what 'need' they are trying to communicate is the key to assessing and ultimately managing BPSD. Psychotropic medications, in particular antipsychotics, are sometimes prescribed for the management of aggression and psychosis in BPSD [6] . Nursing home residents, who typically have more advanced dementia, are significantly more likely to be on an antipsychotic medication than people with dementia living in their own homes, [7] up to five times as likely in one study [8] . However, best practice recommendations warn about the serious side effects associated with the use of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia. Furthermore, there is relatively weak evidence for the efficacy of antipsychotic medication in people with dementia [9] . Antipsychotic use in people with dementia has been associated with an increased mortality risk, increased incidence of stroke, aspiration pneumonia, falls and drowsiness leading to injuries [10, 11] . There is a dearth of economic evaluations comparing pharmacological and non-pharmacological management strategies for BPSD. However, a reduction in healthcare costs is anticipated by the appropriate prescribing of psychotropic medications through reduced medication costs and from reduced health and social care costs related to psychotropic medication adverse events [12] . Therefore, guidelines recommend that non-pharmacological strategies should be employed first line unless there is a risk of harm to the person living with dementia or others [12, 13] . However, psychotropic medications continue to be used to manage BPSD in both residential and community settings [8, 14] , despite their wellknown risk to people with dementia [9, 15] and calls for action to reduce antipsychotic prescribing [16] .",

            "text": "GPs play a vital role in the management of BPSD, and their workload is set to increase in the context of rising dementia prevalence [17] . In the community, the GP is the first point of contact for families and caregivers and has a role in the assessment of potential triggers for behaviours and implementing a management plan. Similarly, in the nursing home setting, GPs work with nursing colleagues in assessing for potential triggers and advising on non-pharmacological treatment options. In both the community and the nursing home setting, it is the GP who is responsible for the prescribing of medications for BPSD. Despite this central role a GP plays in the management of BPSD, previous international studies have shown that GPs, like their hospital-based colleagues [18] , can find the management of the BPSD a particularly challenging aspect of dementia care [18] [19] [20] [21] . A quantitative study carried out in Ireland reported that the majority of GPs acknowledge the importance of non-pharmacological methods to manage BPSD but highlighted the difficulty implementing such methods in reallife practice [22] . A recent mixed method systematic review carried out by the authors on GPs experiences of managing BPSD internationally identified that, in the context of resource limitations, GPs can be over-reliant on antipsychotics and family caregivers when managing BPSD [23] . In a recent qualitative study conducted by the authors, GPs in Ireland reported the following aspects of managing BPSD to be challenging: a lack of clinical guidance, insufficient resources and pressure from family and nursing home staff [24] . At present we do not have a good understanding of GPs' current management of BPSD. This study aims to quantitatively assess Irish GPs' knowledge of and attitudes towards the management of BPSD with a view to informing future interventions in this area.",

We did not find a previously validated questionnaire addressing our research question, and we, therefore, decided to adapt a questionnaire used in a previous Australian study that looked at GPs' prescribing of psychotropic medication for nursing home residents with dementia [26] . After receiving permission from the original author, the questionnaire was modified for use with GPs in Ireland. The questionnaire was modified following a group discussion between the authors. Demographics questions were added to the questionnaire to collect data about the location of GP practice (rural, urban or mixed area), type of GP practice (single or group practice) as well as nursing home commitment. The original questionnaire only looked at the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in nursing home residents; however, our study looked at the prescribing of psychotropic drugs for both community patients and nursing home patients. Therefore, our questionnaire also included questions about community patients. Some questions were rephrased to avoid ambiguity. The questionnaire was piloted with three GPs with an interest in dementia care and refined based on their feedback. The finalised questionnaire had three parts. The first part gathered participant's demographic information. The second part consisted of 5-point Likert-type statements, a series of ranking questions and multiple-choice questions that collected information about GPs' prescribing habits. Finally, the last part asked GPs to share any comments they had in the free text area provided. A summary of information collected in the questionnaire is available in Table 1 .

These are all encouraging findings that are in line with the current prescribing and clinical guidelines [12, 13] . However, there were some conflicting results. Despite the belief that psychotropic medications rarely benefited, or only benefited some people with BPSD, the majority of GPs reported that they would prescribe antipsychotics to most people with dementia who were physically aggressive. Likewise, nearly half of GP respondents reported they would prescribe antipsychotic medication to people with dementia who were agitated or unsettled. While there appears to be a disconnect between GPs' knowledge on the limited efficacy of antipsychotic medications and their clinical practice, these findings serve to highlight the theory/practice gap and the dilemmas faced by practicing GPs. The findings on the barriers to recommending nonpharmacological approaches to BPSD go some way to explaining this discrepancy. Lack of appropriate resources and pressure to prescribe acted as barriers to the GP when attempting to recommend non-pharmacological alternatives. In the community, the lack of resources within the primary care team was reported to be the most significant barrier to recommending non-pharmacological strategies. In the nursing home setting, nursing staffs were identified as the group of people who most influenced GPs' prescribing of antipsychotic medication. Likewise, 'increased staffing levels in nursing homes' was identified as the single change that would most help GPs to reduce the usage of psychotropic medications in BPSD.",

            "text": "This study highlighted the essential role played by nursing home staff when GPs are making a decision to initiate, reduce or stop an antipsychotic in a person with BPSD. That a nurse would be a key influence on a GPs decision to prescribe an antipsychotic is not, in itself, surprising. In a nursing home setting, the nurse is providing daily one to one care for the person with BPSD. The nurse is, therefore, best placed to report on the person with dementia's mood and behaviour. The GP relies on this account from the nurse and it rightly informs the decision-making process. However, in this study, in addition to the nurse's influence, the GPs reported feeling pressurised by nursing home staff to prescribe antipsychotics. Previous studies have identified how pressure from nursing home staff influenced GPs' management decisions in BPSD [26, [29] [30] [31] . In these studies, nursing staff were often seen as a barrier to a GP recommending non-pharmacological strategies. Similarly, in a qualitative study, GPs reported that they found it challenging to manage the expectations of nursing home staff, especially in the context of poor communication pathways between the GP and nursing staff [31] . At what point does the nurse's influence move from an informative aid in a GP's decision-making process on whether to prescribe an antipsychotic to a source of pressure? It could depend on GP factors. A previous Australian study found that the more experienced a GP was, in terms of years in practice, the less likely they were to rate 'pressure to prescribe' as a barrier to recommending non-pharmacological treatments in BPSD [26] . In our previous qualitative study, we did find that GPs who had experience caring for people with dementia had more confidence in their management of BPSD [24] . However, in this present study, neither years in practice nor the extent of the GP's nursing home commitment influenced whether they rated 'pressure to prescribe' as a barrier. The experience of being under pressure to prescribe could also depend on the relationship that exists between the GP and the nursing staff. As identified in our qualitative study, the influence of nursing staff can be helpful and appropriate in the context of a long-standing relationship of trust between the GP and the nurse [24] . A recent systematic review of the qualitative evidence surrounding antipsychotic prescribing in BPSD highlighted the importance of effective communication between healthcare professionals and identified a collaborative approach as the key component of any attempts to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medication [31] . Finally, the experience of being under pressure to prescribe antipsychotic medication could depend on wider resourcing issues in the nursing home. In this study, 'increased staffing levels' was the number one recommendation of participating GPs when asked what would help to reduce the prescribing of psychotropic medications in dementia. Previous studies have identified that chronic understaffing in nursing homes can hinder the nursing staff's ability to implement nonpharmacological strategies [32] and, thus, increase pressure on GPs to prescribe sedative psychotropic medications [26, 29] . It is likely that the prescribing pressure the GP feels from the nursing staff is a combination of all these factors; the experience level of the GP, the relationship between the nurse and the GP, and the resource constraints of the nursing home [32] .",

In our systematic review of international studies, we found that GPs repeatedly highlighted the importance of access to community supports for family caregivers [19, 33, 34] . However, accessing these supports was challenging for GPs. GPs need access to community-based multidisciplinary supports such as community psychologists to successfully implement nonpharmacological strategies in BPSD. This is not currently the case in Ireland [35] . The qualitative comments in this study referenced the lack of available day care centres and home help hours. These are the practical, on the ground, community supports that people with dementia and their families need. Guidance documents advising GPs not to prescribe psychotropic medications in BPSD will only truly be implementable if the necessary supports and resources are provided at a community level, resources that enable GPs to recommend non-pharmacological alternatives. Guidelines for BPSD prescribing without accompanying resources are challenging to implement at the coal face. Repeatedly, evidence has shown that BPSD is a significant trigger for admission to nursing homes [36] . It would seem logical, therefore, that improving how BPSD is managed in the community could effectively postpone a person's admission to a nursing home, recouping the economic cost of a policy decision to increase community supports and resources.",

Anecdotally, the authors are seeing in practice the negative impact these changes are having on people living with dementia and their caregivers.

Finally, because this study was anonymous, it is possible that non-response and group differences might have been sources of bias in our study. Finally, this study relied on participant recall of what they would do in specific situations. This might have biased responses towards what GPs perceive as best practice but gives us an idea of what GPs would ideally do if there were no barriers to this practice.
