Since many patients with chronic pulmonary diseases rely on corticosteroids to control disease, it is important to understand the risks of their use during the pandemic. We aim to study if the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids affects the likelihood of developing COVID-19 infection. Methods: We used the National Jewish Health electronic medical record research database to identify a cohort of all subjects who were tested for suspected COVID-19 between March 11 -June 23, 2020. Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Conclusions: Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic pulmonary diseases, have worse outcomes including greater hospitalizations, intensive care unit admission, and mortality. 1,2 Surprisingly, different from diabetes, the prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19 was lower compared to the general population. 3 One possibility for the low prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases in COVID-19 patients is that therapies used to treat these diseases may be protective and/or decrease the susceptibility to infection with SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. One of the most commonly prescribed medications used in chronic pulmonary diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is corticosteroids, administered by inhalation and less often, systemically. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases using inhaled corticosteroids concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids resulted in adverse or beneficial outcomes for COVID-19. 4 One explanation is that different inhaled corticosteroids (e.g.",

Despite recent evidence of beneficial effects of dexamethasone in treating COVID-19-associated acute lung injury 6, 7 , systemic corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive drugs or biologics are known to dose-dependently increase the risk for a variety of other infections. Therefore, they are intuitively thought to also increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence whether and/or how corticosteroids affect COVID-19 susceptibility. In our study, we sought to investigate the association between the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroid and the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals suspected of having acute viral respiratory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f disease, drawn from a cohort of subjects with a high prevalence of pre-existing chronic pulmonary diseases.

There are, to our knowledge, no studies that have reported this association. A recent editorial cautioned that patients who are taking corticosteroids may have increased susceptibility to COVID-19, although our study suggests the contrary. 20 Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology, based on expert opinion, recommend using the lowest effective dose of corticosteroids to control the underlying rheumatic disease. 21 Our study offers evidence that individuals on systemic corticosteroid treatment may have reduced COVID-19 susceptibility, especially those with airway diseases.

A previous study in six European countries indicated that sex differences in COVID-19 susceptibility varied with age, with a higher risk of males being noted in those above 50years old 22 . This association may also be related to gender-specific (e.g. occupational) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exposure risks. Emerging evidence supports that male gender is also associated with higher COVID-19 mortality, with a 1.7 times higher average case fatality rate in males than in females, based on sex-disaggregated data from 37 countries. 23 Our study revealed that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases have a lower prevalence of COVID-19 test positivity. This finding is consistent with observations in a recent editorial, 3 implicating the possibility of underdiagnosed (missed) chronic pulmonary disease diagnoses in their population. However, this is unlikely in our cohort, where the prevalence of chronic pulmonary diseases was high (66%) with the population drawn from a health care center dedicated to respiratory conditions. Another explanation proposed in the above editorial was that medications used by patients with chronic pulmonary diseases may reduce COVID-19 susceptibility; this is in fact supported by our study. Interestingly, in our study, the protective effect of corticosteroids on COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases remained significant even after adjusting for medication use and other comorbidities. This suggests that individuals with chronic pulmonary diseases may exhibit immunological differences that are protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another potential explanation that seems more likely is that individuals with chronic pulmonary disease are more likely to practice preventive measures such as social distancing or face mask usage more effectively than those without chronic pulmonary disease. Besides, the difference in the prevalence may be related to the disproportionately higher numbers of COPD/asthma patients in our study cohort. Given this limitation and the fact that this outcome was not the primary focus of the study design, further investigations are needed to determine the interaction between underlying comorbidities and COVID-19 risk.",

This limitation may explain why we did not find diabetes as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. However, our findings may be applied to patients with chronic pulmonary diseases Third, we do not have sufficient information about the dosage or duration of medication use and cannot assess how those might have affected the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 Fourth, the mean age of our study population is relatively young (53 years old) which may not be representative of the total population. This may be an important confounder and limitation to our study results since age is an independent factor of COVID severity and mortality. 29 Finally, similar to other electronic medical research, non-differential misclassification of binary variables may reduce the power of detecting a true association.",

Our finding that systemic corticosteroids decreased COVID-19 susceptibility should be interpreted with caution due to the above-mentioned limitations. However, our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases who have indications for either inhaled or systemic corticosteroid therapy should continue using them during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Discontinuation of those medications for concern regarding COVID-19 risk may be unnecessary and detrimental, as corticosteroids may be essential to control asthma, COPD, and other chronic pulmonary diseases such as sarcoidosis, and autoimmune lung diseases.",

There were no significant associations between ACE/ARBs, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, or biologics/JAK inhibitors use and testing positive for COVID-19 in either overlap propensity score-weighted analysis or conventional logistic regression analysis using all or subgroups of patients. To further explore the effects of different corticosteroid formulations on susceptibility COVID-19, we have compared the prevalence of testing positive for COVID-19 among patients using different types of corticosteroids. For systemic corticosteroids, 191 of the 214 patients (89%) who received systemic corticosteroids used prednisone while 18 patients (8%) used methylprednisolone and the remaining 5 patients (3%) used other systemic corticosteroids. The prevalence of testing positive for COVID-19 in patients using prednisone was 5.7% compared to 5.6% of patients using methylprednisolone(Chi-square P-value =0.97), suggesting no significant difference in the prevalence on the two different main systemic corticosteroid formulations use. For inhaled corticosteroids, we exclude 10 patients out of 348 patients who used more than one J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhaled corticosteroid formulations. Among the remaining 338 patients, 156 patients (46%) who received inhaled corticosteroids used fluticasone while 138 patients (41%) used budesonide, and 44 patients (13%) used other inhaled corticosteroids (24 patients used beclomethasone, 16 patients used mometasone, and 4 patients used ciclesonide). The prevalence of testing positive for COVID-19 in patients using fluticasone was 12.2% compared to 8.7% of patients using budesonide (Chi-square P-value =0.33), suggesting no significant difference in the prevalence on the two different main inhaled corticosteroid formulations use. For commonly used biologics in asthma such as anti-IL5 and anti-IgE, we observed a COVID-19 prevalence of 8.3% in patients using anti-IL5 (2 out of 24) and in patients using anti-IgE 11.1% (2 out of 18) (Chisquare P-value =0.76), suggesting no difference in the prevalence on the two different biologicsuse. We performed analyses restricted to 708 patients (76% of the overall cohort) with recorded data on BMI, smoking status, and pack-years. When including these variables in the model, there was no significant association between any medication use and testing positive for COVID-19 in the overlap propensity score-weighted analysis. Conventional logistic regression analysis indicated that testing positive for COVID-19 was higher in males (OR 1.76; 95% CI:1.01-3.08, e-",
