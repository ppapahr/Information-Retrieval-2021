Meeting sufficient sleep during the COVID-19 is important since the good night's sleep is considered to be one of the best ways to improve the immunity and defend against viruses and diseases [13] . In addition, insomnia has been reported to have an indirect association with negative categories of the doctor-patient relationship [12] . Sleep and the circadian system pose a strong regulatory influence on immune functions. The normal sleep-wake cycle has been shown to affect the number of undifferentiated na\u00efve T cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, sleep has been suggested to facilitate the extravasation of T cells and their possible redistribution to lymph nodes [13] . The present study showed that the sleep was more escalated by stress rather than days spent focusing on the COVID-19; r=0.558 and r=0.210, respectively. The reason behind this finding is that the HCWs work periodically in corona special hospital. Therefore, we can say that the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on sleep difficulty has been mediated by stress made by the outbreak on physicians.
