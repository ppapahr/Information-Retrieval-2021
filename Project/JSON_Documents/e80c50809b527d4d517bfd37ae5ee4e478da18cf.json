The weakening of environmental enforcement is most likely due to the difficulties imposed by COVID-19, but the pandemic can also word as an excuse for ill-intentioned governments. In Brazil, a number of controversial actions by the Ministry of the Environment have occurred since the outbreak started in March 2020.",

The current government questioned this understanding, with a more flexible and weaker interpretation that would have dire consequences to the Atlantic Forest (Brasil, 2020a) . It would result in the amnesty of up to 20,000 km 2 of illegally deforested land, the removal of protection of 110,000 km 2 of currently protected vegetation within islands and mangroves, and inaction on 3,297 km 2 of vegetation in 'permanent preservation areas' that should had been restored (Rosa and Azevedo, 2020) . COVID-19 is also harmful for these areas that need restoration, as one of its more lasting impacts will be economic, restricting the availability of funds, particularly for active restoration that requires tree planting (Zahawi et al. 2020) . The synergism between the changes in the Atlantic Forest Law and the economic cutbacks caused by the COVID-19, therefore, could be disastrous for this already threatened ecosystem.

            "text": "Council (Conama) Another way to weakening Ibama and ICMBio is to cut budgets and reduce the infrastructure available for law enforcement operations, especially those against deforestation in the Amazon, which require aircraft support and complex logistics (Brant and Machado, 2020) . The direct consequence is a reduction in the number of fines applied for environmental infractions (Fig. 2) . Usually, there is an increase in the number of fines with an increase in the number of environmental infractions, as seen for Amazon deforestation in 2019 (Fig. 2) . However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite high deforestation rates, the number of fines was reduced by 72%",

Its composition was modified in 2019 to increase the presence of the government and reduce that of civil society, and in September 2020 revoked three key environmental rules. The rules revoked led to weaker standards and procedures for pesticides and changed the definition of permanent preservation areas. This last decision reduces the protection of coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and sandy coastal plain vegetation, which have an important role in coastal protection, and are included in Brazil's National Plan for Climate Adaptation (Brasil, 2016). Finally, in November 2020, the Supreme Court suspended the effects of that decision, considering the risk of violation of the constitutional principle of non-regression in environmental protection and disregard to international agreements where Brazil is a signatory ((particularly those linked to the Ministry of the Environment). This appears to have intensified during the pandemic. The elimination of the Ministry of the Environment has always been on the agenda of the current administration (Stachewski, 2019; Bragan\u00e7a, 2018), as well as the merging of the two main federal environmental management bodies: the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), in charge of inspection and environmental licensing, and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), which manages protected areas and conservation programs for threatened species (Borges, 2020a). Society's reaction has been able to prevent both measures thus far (see Societal Response section below), but other actions have been reducing the management capacity of these bodies (Borges, 2020b). Nationwide, at all levels of environmental administration, police or military staff are systematically replacing administrative and reserve heads, who previously had technical or environmental expertise (Bragan\u00e7a and Menegassi 2020). Just in May 2020, 38 reserve and sub-reserve heads were dismissed (Bragan\u00e7a and Menegassi 2020). Many protected areas had head positions removed and staff relocated to regional offices called Integrated Management Centers (NGI, in Portuguese), weakening the management and enforcement in the field. The change, made with no clear ecological or geographical criteria, left protected areas essentially headless and understaffed. The protected area that has saved the emblematic Golden Lion Tamarin, for example, lost its head in May 2020 (Gon\u00e7alves et al., Amazon, the change of staff has been directly linked to those who were on the forefront of command-and-control operations to curb deforestation. For example, the Ituna-Itat\u00e1 Indigenous Land has a group of indigenous people living in voluntary isolation. In 2019, this was the most deforested indigenous land in Brazil, with 120 km 2 of forests cleared (data from INPE,http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/deforestation/biomes/legal_a mazon/rates), a figure six times higher than the Kayap\u00f3 Indigenous Land, which came second. In the beginning of 2020, Ibama conducted several command-and-control operations in the area, which were featured in April in the most watched TV news program in the country. Two days later, the Ibama director of environmental protection and the two Ibama officials who led these operations were removed from office(Gonzales, 2020).",

A 2019 decree eliminated all councils and collegiate bodies of the federal public administration that were not created by specific laws. Conama had its composition changed, with a sharp reduction in seats for civil society, leaving it dominated by governmental officials(Brasil, 2019a). Another example of the reduced participatory process in the environmental administration is the changes made in the commission in charge of the National Plan for the Restoration of Native Vegetation (PLANAVEG) of the Ministry of the Environment. In August 2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new program called \"Regenera Brasil\" was created by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation,",
