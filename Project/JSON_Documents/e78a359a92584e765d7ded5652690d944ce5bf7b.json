            "text": "We use simulated data to examine the consequences of depletion of susceptibles for hazard ratio (HR) estimators based on a propensity score (PS). First, we show that the depletion of susceptibles attenuates marginal HRs toward the null by amounts that increase with the incidence of the outcome, the variance of susceptibility, and the impact of susceptibility on the outcome. If susceptibility is binary then the Bross bias multiplier, originally intended to quantify bias in a risk ratio from a binary confounder, also quantifies the ratio of the instantaneous marginal HR to the conditional HR as susceptibles are depleted differentially. Second, we show how HR estimates that are conditioned on a PS tend to be between the true conditional and marginal HRs, closer to the conditional HR if treatment status is strongly associated with susceptibility and closer to the marginal HR if treatment status is weakly associated with susceptibility. We show that associations of susceptibility with the PS matter to the marginal HR in the treated (ATT) though not to the marginal HR in the entire cohort (ATE). Third, we show how the PS can be updated periodically to reduce depletion-of-susceptibles bias in conditional estimators. Although marginal estimators can hit their ATE or ATT targets consistently without updating the PS, we show how their targets themselves can be misleading as they are attenuated toward the null. Finally, we discuss implications for the interpretation of HRs and their relevance to underlying scientific and clinical questions. See video Abstract: http://links.lww.com/EDE/B727. Columns 7 and 8 show prevalences of susceptibility at interval's start; columns 3-6 show the N of survivors (parenthesized) at interval's end. b Bross's formula for sensitivity of a risk ratio estimate to a confounder is shown here to yield the ratio of the iHRm (column 10) to HRc (0.5) at t.

            "text": "S usceptibles are defined as individuals whose baseline risk is relatively high. If the outcome can only happen to a person once-like death-then the prevalence of susceptibility in a cohort decreases over time because susceptibles tend to have earlier outcome events. Even in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), if the treatment reduces risk then the treated and untreated groups lose their susceptibles at different rates: the prevalence of susceptibility decreases faster in the untreated group than in the treated group. Consequently, the risk profile of the untreated survivors becomes more favorable than that of the treated survivors. This process, termed \"differential depletion of susceptibles,\" poses challenges for the estimation and interpretation of hazard ratios (HRs) in survival analyses. Unless we ascertain and adjust for all aspects of susceptibility, the HR attenuates toward the null. This is a known source of selection bias, yet it is often overlooked. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] We use the acronym HRc to denote an HR that is conditional on susceptibility and HRm to denote an HR that is marginal (i.e., population-averaged over time). In an RCT-or a cohort study balanced by propensity score (PS) matching or weighting-the HRm equals the HRc initially, then the HRm diverges toward the null (unless it is already at the null) as outcomes occur. Our aims are to: (1) show how the divergence of the HRm from the HRc is driven by the incidence of the outcome, the distribution of susceptibility, and the effect of susceptibility on the outcome. (2) show how HRc estimators that condition on a PS tend to yield estimates between the HRc and HRm, closer to the HRc if the PS is strongly associated with the outcome (within each treatment group) and closer to the HRm if the PS is weakly associated with the outcome.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] A subsequent Sentinel workgroup proposed a time-dependent PS to reduce this bias. 14 Here, we provide new insight into the bias, add refinements to the time-dependent PS, and point out features of research questions that can make the HRc-rather than the HRm or alternative effect measure-an appropriate target. Table 1 shows attenuation of the HRm in a hypothetical RCT of a treatment that always reduces mortality by 50% (HRc = 0.5). One million subjects are randomized 1:1 to be treated or not. Half are susceptible (high risk), which multiplies risk ten-fold. Everyone is followed until death. Each row of the table summarizes an interval when 1% of subjects die. The first row shows the 10,000 earliest deaths; the last row shows the last 10,000. Columns 3-6 show the interval's deaths (and survivors) in four subgroups: high-risk treated, low-risk treated, high-risk untreated, and low-risk untreated. Given that 50% of subjects are treated, 50% are susceptible, treatment reduces mortality by 50%, and susceptibility multiplies mortality ten-fold, we have enough information to identify each subgroup's share of each row's 10,000 deaths. (All 100 rows are shown in eTable 1; http://links.lww.com/EDE/ B712.) Column 10 shows the instantaneous HRm (iHRm) in each interval: mortality among the treated divided by mortality among the untreated. Thus, the iHRm in interval 5 is: The iHRm diverges from the HRc toward the null as susceptibles are depleted. It reaches a maximum of 0.95 when 57% of the cohort has died (row 57); then gradually returns to 0.50. For intuition about why the iHRm stops moving away from the HRc and starts returning to it, notice that after row 57 the RCT's untreated arm is so depleted of its susceptibles that mortality no longer exacerbates the imbalance in susceptibility but instead restores balance.",

When outcomes are infrequent or unaffected by the treatment, the HRm and HRc are nearly equal and this bias is negligible.

Imagine that the true HRc is stable at 0.5 yet influenza incidence is high, susceptibles are depleted differentially, and by March so many unvaccinated susceptibles have been infected (and are immune to reinfection this season) that Bross's bias multiplier is 1.89, as in row 57 of Table 1 . If our research question is whether vaccine protection wanes (so that vaccination should be delayed until November for more timely protection), then the relevant target is the trajectory of the HRc-the trajectory of the HRm could be misleading insofar as it reflects depletion of susceptibles. As the HRm attenuates from 0.5 to 0.95, the corresponding VE estimate decreases from 50% to 5% due to selection bias.

(See Ray on depletion-of-susceptibles bias in research on the waning of vaccine protection. 22 ) Although our estimators use Cox regression, we need not assume that the HRm or HRc was constant-indeed their divergence implies that one or both changed. To examine a trend in an HRm or HRc, we can specify time-by-treatment interaction effects or divide the timeline into intervals and estimate the HR in each interval.

When the treatment effect is expected to be multiplicative, we can target the HRc. If it may be strengthening or weakening, we can target its trajectory. Whereas Hern\u00e1n duly emphasizes the value of marginal survival curves, the HRc and its trajectory answer some research questions more directly. It can be helpful to ascertain the treatment's effect on the individual survivors (as measured by the HRc) apart from The true HRc = 2, each simulated cohort has N = 10 5 , and the Monte Carlo 95% confidence interval for each mean HR estimate is <0.007 in width.",
