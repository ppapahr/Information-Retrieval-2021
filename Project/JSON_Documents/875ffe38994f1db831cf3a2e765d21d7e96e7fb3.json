COVID-19 has been classified as a member of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily under the Corona viridae family [1] . The members of this family are generally categorized as zoonotic viruses and transmission to humans occurs as a result of contact with infected animals. Bats and snakes have been implicated as the major reservoirs of coronavirus [2] . COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, has an 80% similar identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the strains share similar lipid rafts. Human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets has been the major infection route and has caused the spread of the virus [3] . The potential for the virus to spread widely resulted in a global pandemic in 2020, which caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [4] on 30th January 2020. As of the time of writing (on May 17, 2020), there are approximately 4,500,00 confirmed cases of human infections in 213 countries, areas, or territories with more than 300,000 deaths worldwide [4] . The primary target of the virus is the lower respiratory tract, which subsequently leads to distress or multiple organ failure in severe cases due to replication of the virus [5] . Lack of access to critical early detections and diagnostic tools has contributed to patient death [6] . A widely used method for diagnosing COVID- 19 infections is the nucleic acid test based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR tests is low, which means it is not adequate for diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing of infected patients [7] . In addition, the process of obtaining the results with real-time RT-PCR test can take between 3 and 8 hours. Due to the aforementioned reasons, there is a need to investigate other timely approaches for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Since its introduction in the 1970s, CT scanning has revolutionized diagnostic decision making and has had a major impact on the field of surgery, where it has decreased the need for surgery from 13% to 5% and has made many exploratory surgical procedures extinct [8] . Several studies have reported high specificity in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT [7, 9] . However, associated radiation exposure incurred by patients is one of the downsides of CT. This assertion is supported by a study .
