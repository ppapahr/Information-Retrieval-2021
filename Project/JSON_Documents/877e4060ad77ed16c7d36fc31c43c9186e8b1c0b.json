            "text": "Retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to improve epithelial and endothelial barrier function and development and even suppress damage inflicted by inflammation on these barriers through regulating immune cell activity. This paper thus sought to determine whether RA could improve baseline barrier function and attenuate TNF-\u03b1-induced barrier leak in the human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE14o-(16HBE). We show for the first time that RA increases baseline barrier function of these cell layers indicated by an 89% increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 22% decrease in 14 C-mannitol flux. A simultaneous, RA-induced 70% increase in claudin-4 attests to RA affecting the tight junctional (TJ) complex itself. RA was also effective in alleviating TNF-\u03b1-induced 16HBE barrier leak, attenuating 60% of the TNF-\u03b1-induced leak to 14 C-mannitol and 80% of the leak to 14 C-inulin. Interleukin-6induced barrier leak was also reduced by RA. Treatment of 16HBE cell layers with TNF-\u03b1 resulted in dramatic decrease in immunostaining for occludin and claudin-4, as well as a downward \"band-shift\" in occludin Western immunoblots. The presence of RA partially reversed TNF-\u03b1's effects on these select TJ proteins. Lastly, RA completely abrogated the TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in ERK-1,2 phosphorylation without significantly decreasing the TNF-driven increase in total ERK-1,2. This study suggests RA could be effective as a prophylactic agent in minimizing airway barrier leak and as a therapeutic in preventing leak triggered by inflammatory cascades. Given the growing literature suggesting a \"cytokine storm\" may be related to COVID-19 morbidity, RA may be a useful adjuvant for use with anti-viral therapies.",

            "text": "Epithelial tissues are physical barriers between the outside environment and our systemic circulation and interstitial tissue. Examples are the epidermis of the skin and the linings of organs defining luminal spaces in our body such as our gastrointestinal tract, renal tubes, and alveoli in the lungs [1] . Cells constituting these protective sheets are unique in that they polarize (form a distinct apical side directed toward the lumen and a basolateral side connected to an underlying basement membrane) and form specialized junctional seals termed tight junctions (TJ) around and between adjacent cells [2] . A family of proteins including tricellulin, occludin, and 27 distinct claudins comprise the barrier element of TJs in a variety of different combinations throughout different epithelia [1] [2] [3] . These proteins extend from the cell into the intercellular space, forming oligomeric complexes with TJ proteins of adjacent epithelial cells to create a circumferential seal around the subapical perimeter [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Establishment of apico-basal polarity and regulation of paracellular permeability to fluid and solutes (barrier function) is dependent on these TJ proteins and their intracellular complexes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . TJs are pivotal in the development and maintenance of epithelial barriers throughout the body, and epithelial barriers are vital to any organism's homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial barrier leak is associated with disease in many different organ systems such as inflammatory bowel disease in the gastrointestinal tract, acute renal failure in the kidneys, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the lungs [2, 6]. The airway epithelium limits infiltration of inhaled noxious stimuli into underlying tissue and vasculature, and in the process prevents damaging immune reactions [1, 7] . In addition to inhibiting pathogens, allergens, carcinogens, and other detrimental compounds from entering the body, this barrier also prevents interstitial and vascular fluid from leaking into the lungs and interfering with gas exchange [4, 5] . Altered structure/function of this barrier and its associated TJs is observed in a variety of lung disorders such as rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic asthma, ARDS, and lung cancer [4, 7, [8] [9] [10] . The lifethreatening nature of these diseases highlights why it is crucial to maintain an intact epithelium that lines the airways and alveoli and restore any compromised barrier function.",

This suggests TNF-\u03b1 may play a role in altering the phosphorylation state for this TJ protein [29] . Occludin band densities were analyzed in detergent soluble fractions of 16HBE cell layers to determine whether any changes in intensity would be observed in occludin protein bands present in TJs. As shown in Fig 6A, two prominent bands were observed in Western immunoblots of occludin in detergent soluble fractions. Prior work by our group and others suggests that these bands represent phosphoproteins of occludin [30] . After 48 hours of exposure, TNF-\u03b1 induced an obvious decrease in the upper band intensity while slightly increasing the lower band density (downward band-shift) (Fig 6) . The proportion of upper to lower band densities were quantified, which revealed that TNF-\u03b1 produced a 33% decrease in the ratio while the addition of RA produced a 55% increase, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 and the combination of TNF-\u03b1 and RA are modulating occludin phosphorylation in opposite directions (Fig 6C) .",

To our knowledge, this is the first study showing improvement in airway basal barrier function using RA. Suppression of endogenous TNF-\u03b1 production may be partially responsible for RA's induced elevation in basal barrier strength given TNF-\u03b1's detrimental effect on the 16HBE barrier (Figs 1 and 2) . While only TNF-\u03b1 production was assessed here, RA could also be dampening production of other cytokines as is the case in mouse hepatocytes, in human and mouse adipocytes, in rats with collagen-induced arthritis, and in the kidneys of diabetic rats [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . More experimentation would be needed to reveal the distinct mechanisms involved in RA enhancing barrier function of 16HBE cell layers, but the physiological results presented here do suggest that RA could be useful prophylactically in preventing lung barrier dysfunction in vivo.",

In LLC-PK 1 , renal cell layers, both TNF-\u03b1 and the phorbol ester, TPA, induced leak [40] . However, the leak produced by these two inducers exhibited very different characteristics [40] . A size limit existed as to which probe molecules manifested increased leak triggered by TNF-\u03b1, while no such size limit existed for TPA-induced leak. The presence of holes (or complete loss of TJs) created by TPA would be consistent with the absence of any size limitation, while the lack of holes in TNF-\u03b1 treated cell layers would result in only low MW probes crossing cell layers [40] . Since no size limit was observed for TNF-\u03b1-induced leak in 16HBE (increased leak for mannitol, lactulose and inulin), holes may be present in addition to alterations in TJs. In any event, what is most important is that RA almost completely restores barrier strength of this airway model in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 to all three probes (Figs 3 and 4) . The implications of this could be very important for patients with high systemic levels of cytokines, placing them at an increased risk of lung water accumulation and subsequent respiratory distress. This data suggests that RA could be helpful either therapeutically or prophylactically.",

Further, the degree of phosphorylation of occludin correlates with its localization, with increased phosphorylation of occludin associating with TJ localization and less phosphorylation associating with non-TJ localization [45] . Here, immunostaining of occludin was greatly diminished in TNF-\u03b1-treated cell layers (Fig 5) . Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 caused a downward \"band-shift\" of occludin, suggesting a decrease in occludin phosphorylation (Fig 6) , though this contrasts with what was observed in hCMEC/D3 cells where an upwardshift of occludin was rapidly initiated by TNF-\u03b1 [28] . These results could suggest TNF-\u03b1induced leak in 16HBE cell layers is partially carried out through induced change in occludin phosphorylation with subsequent or concurrent loss of occludin from TJs. In addition to altering occludin-and potentially other TJ proteins'-phosphorylation states, TNF-\u03b1 could also induce paracellular leak by triggering MLCK-dependent endocytosis of TJ proteins [46] .",

As we have shown (Figs 1 and 5) , TNF-and RA-induced changes in claudin-4 are also pronounced. Investigations into many other TJ proteins are clearly required and will be the subject of future studies by our group. In this regard, it is worth noting that RA is not only reducing the changes in occludin and claudin-4 abundance caused by TNF (Fig 5) but is itself capable of causing increased levels of claudin-4 in control cell layers (Fig 1C) . It should be noted however that whereas in immunofluorescence the sharply decreased claudin-4 signal caused by TNF is partially reversed by RA, this was not observed in Western immunoblotting. Therefore, a focal effect regarding RA reversal of TNF action on claudin-4 cannot be ruled out here.",

Furthermore, evidence for an association between the cytokine storm and resulting lung water may be building [32, 54] .
