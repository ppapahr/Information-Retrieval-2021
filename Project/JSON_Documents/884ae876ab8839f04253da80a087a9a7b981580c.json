However, these clinical decision tools have had suboptimal uptake in the everyday clinical practice in emergency departments (EDs), despite numerous implementation efforts. We aimed to test the feasibility of a multi-faceted intervention to implement an evidence-based PE diagnosis protocol. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series study in three EDs in Ontario, Canada. We enrolled consecutive adult patients accessing the ED with suspected PE from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2020. Components of the intervention were as follows: clinical leadership endorsement, a new pathway for PE testing, physician education, personalized confidential physician feedback, and collection of patient outcome information. The intervention was implemented in November 2019. We identified six criteria for defining the feasibility outcome: successful implementation of the intervention in at least two of the three sites, capturing data on \u2265 80% of all CTPAs ordered in the EDs, timely access to electronic data, rapid manual data extraction with feedback preparation before the end of the month \u2265 80% of the time, and time required for manual data extraction and feedback preparation \u2264 2 days per week in total. Results: The intervention was successfully implemented in two out of three sites. A total of 5094 and 899 patients were tested for PE in the period before and after the intervention, respectively. We captured data from 90% of CTPAs ordered in the EDs, and we accessed the required electronic data. The manual data extraction and individual emergency physician audit and feedback were consistently finalized before the end of each month. The time required for manual data extraction and feedback preparation was \u2264 2 days per week (14 h).",

            "text": "The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a multistep process. At least 10 different clinical decision tools are available [1] , mainly aimed at reducing the use of advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilationperfusion scan (VQ). When PE prevalence is 15%, clinician's Gestalt, the Wells score, and the Revised Geneva score all have an estimated sensitivity greater than 80%. When combined with D-dimer testing, the failure rate for PE diagnosis is below 2% [1] . These standards are now used to benchmark the safety of new PE tests. Clinical decision tool use is endorsed by recent guidelines [2] . Despite high-quality evidence supporting the use of these diagnostic algorithms, published data show that these tools are seldom used in everyday clinical practice [3] [4] [5] [6] . The main effect of this is the overuse of CTPA, which translates into excess radiation exposure, the possibility of contrast-induced nephropathy, overtreatment, and reduction of health system efficiency and resources. According to some simulations, 0.6 to 2.0% of all cancers in the USA may be attributable to the radiation from CT studies [7, 8] . Contrast-induced nephropathy is reported in 1-2% of patients with normal renal function and 5% of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing an intravenous low-osmolality contrast-medium injection for computed tomography [9] . Contrast-induced nephropathy is associated with increased mortality, need for dialysis, and longer hospital stays [10] . The knowledge translation gap persists despite numerous efforts to improve the implementation of evidence-based diagnostic pathways [6, 11] . The reasons why implementation studies to date had minimal or no impact on the use of CTPA include the perception that clinical decision support systems are complicated, have a negative impact on productivity, are not supported by a sufficient body of evidence, and are not better than clinical judgment [6, 11] . Moreover, defensive behaviors, such as \"fear of missing PE,\" have been identified as associated with a lower CTPA positive yield [12] , and might be a barrier to the implementation of quality improvement interventions. This tendency toward overtesting seems to be more rooted in the North American environment, than in European [13] .",

            "text": "de Wit and colleagues conducted a nationwide thinkaloud interview study with 63 emergency department (ED) physicians from nine sites (unpublished data). This study found that the sources of variance in decisionmaking arose from the following: (1) physicians' risk tolerance for missing a PE diagnosis being very low, (2) physicians are confident in their gestalt and think their suspicion is sufficient to order a CTPA, (3) the Wells score is perceived as complicated and can lead to either under-or overestimation of clinical probability (this might apply to the other tools, but only the Wells score was investigated in this study), and (4) having to order a D-dimer blood test, waiting for the results, and then ordering a CTPA if needed is perceived as delaying an inevitable scan. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, this same group interviewed ED physicians within 2 weeks of them having deviated for evidencebased protocol for PE diagnosis (unpublished data). They found the following themes: (1) reserved confidence in the clinical guidelines and ability to apply them, (2) belief that strong clinical gestalt is crucial when testing for PE, (3) fear of not diagnosing PE, and (4) belief that the advantages of the standard protocol outweigh the disadvantages. Lastly, our research group has also performed semi-structured interviews with ED patients who were being tested for PE [14] . Patient interviews revealed zero tolerance for false positive and false negative diagnoses, association of rapid ED assessment with better quality testing, preference for individualized testing, contradictory acceptance of CT limitations for PE diagnosis, overestimation of pretest probability for PE, association between more tests with better quality testing, preference for imaging over clinical examination to exclude PE, primary concern being testing related to previous heart-related issue, a focus on pain symptoms rather than underlying diagnosis, and a preference for direct interaction with ED physician.",

Furthermore, we decided to design a multi-faceted intervention, ensuring leadership endorsement and targeting patients and healthcare workers, with a focus on physicians. However, given the challenges and the negative results from previous quality improvement studies for PE diagnosis, we decided to assess the feasibility of our intervention in two centers in Hamilton, ON, and one in Ottawa, ON, before attempting to assess its effect or to implement the protocol on a larger scale.

The population was consecutive adults (aged 18 years and older) with suspected PE, for whom a D-dimer blood test and/or imaging for PE (CTPA or VQ scan) were performed in the ED. When a patient books into the ED, the triage nurse assigns a chief complaint from a selection of predefined categories, classified based on the Canadian Emergency Department Information Systems (CEDIS) Presenting Complaint List [16] . D-dimer blood test is used to diagnose both deep vein thrombosis and PE, so to ensure we captured only patients tested for PE (and not deep vein thrombosis), we aimed to restrict our population to those who presented to the ED with the presenting complaint \"chest pain\" (cardiac and non-cardiac) and/or \"shortness of breath.\" To evaluate whether a sufficient proportion of all patients tested for PE were registered under these two presenting complaints, we retrieved a list of CTPAs ordered in the ED in 2018. We manually extracted the presenting complaints for each case. We aimed to capture a minimum of 80% of the CTPAs ordered in the ED. The rationale for the use of predefined triage categories to identify the study population was to reduce inter-person variability in this process.",

The implementation was not successful at a hospital in Ottawa, ON, due to the lack of availability of dedicated resources for data access and manual data extraction. We were able to obtain timely electronic data which identified 90% of the CTPAs ordered in the Hamilton EDs. We found that this implementation protocol takes approximately 14 h per week of research assistant and investigator time. While we successfully implemented the intervention in two out of three centers, we faced numerous barriers. We were expecting to meet some resistance to change due to bureaucracy and human nature, but this translated in delays greater than expected: we were aiming at implementing the intervention in May 2019, but we actually implemented it in November 2019. We encountered measurement barriers, in that it took some time to identify a timely source of electronic data, which required additional manual chart extraction. The secondary outcome preliminary results showed a signal of improved adherence to the proposed intervention, with fewer imaging tests ordered without D-dimer or despite a negative D-dimer, and more imaging tests ordered after a positive D-dimer. However, for now, this did not translate into a reduction of the use of imaging tests, nor in an increase of the positive yield of imaging. The results suggest an increase in the use of D-dimer and imaging tests, and the prevalence of PE in the population remained the same. It is still too soon to claim that the intervention is futile, but these preliminary results should not be ignored. For this intervention to be meaningful and before scaling it up to a multicenter study, we will need to carefully assess its effect in our population. Historically, most implementation strategies have failed to reduce the number of imaging tests and improve the diagnostic yield of imaging [11] . By embedding a clinical decision support tool for ordering CTPAs in the computerized order entry system, Prevedello et al. showed a small reduction in the use of CTPAs (from 26.5 to 24.3/1000 patient visits, p < 0.2) and an increase in the yield of CTPAs (from 9.2 to 12.6%, p < .01) [23] . Later on, the same research group failed to further improve these outcomes implementing a performance feedback report for ED physicians. One explanation for our finding may be that we chose not to implement an adjusted D-dimer strategy (such as the YEARS algorithm [24] , clinical probability [25] , or age-adjusted [26] Ddimer). We chose this plan for simplicity. It may be that implementing an adjusted D-dimer strategy would have been more effective and we are considering changing the intervention in this direction.",

The generalizability of the study results, both in terms of feasibility and evaluation of the effect of the intervention, may be reduced because the intervention was implemented only in Hamilton EDs. A multicenter step-wedge trial would have mitigated these limitations. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic appears to be changing the population attending EDs. We expect to see a reduction of visits for complaints that are not related to COVID-19. We also expect the ED personnel to work under a higher level of stress, which might jeopardize the adherence to our protocol. Another limitation is that we were not able to present data on the safety of the intervention. To address this limitation, we are collecting data on the EDs access of any patient with PE in the 30 days preceding the diagnosis. This will increase the data extraction workload but will allow us to find out if these patients could have been diagnosed before and were not, and if Fig. 4 Time trend of testing for PE. The aim of this figure is to display our collected data to show how we will analyze the data in the future. The regression line for the period after the intervention is based on only three points and might not be a reliable estimate of the effect of the intervention this is due to lack of adherence to the protocol or to insufficient safety of the protocol itself.",
