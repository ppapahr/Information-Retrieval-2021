Patients were categorised according to month of hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by month of admission, adjusting for, age, sex, comorbidities, care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (patients in intensive care units; ICU). Findings: A total of 17,140 patients were included, of which 2943 died within 60 days of admission. The overall 60-day mortality was thus 17\u00a22% (95% CI, 16\u00a26%-17\u00a27%), and it decreased from 24\u00a27% (95% CI, 23\u00a20%-26\u00a25%) in March to 10\u00a24% (95% CI, 8\u00a29%-12\u00a21%) post-wave (July-September). Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0\u00a246 (95% CI, 0\u00a239\u00c00\u00a254) post-wave, using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those admitted to ICU were 0\u00a249 (95% CI, 0\u00a242\u00c00\u00a259) and 0\u00a249 (95% CI, 0\u00a233\u00c00\u00a272), respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19\u00a24% (95% CI, 17\u00a29%-21\u00a21%) in the March cohort to 8\u00a29% (95% CI, 7\u00a25%-10\u00a26%) post-wave. Interpretation: There was a gradual decline in mortality during the spring of 2020 in Swedish hospitalised COVID-19 patients, independent of baseline patient characteristics. Future research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing COVID-19 mortality should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.",

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been a gradual and substantial increase in our understanding of COVID-19. This may have contributed to the improved survival that has been noted among ICU-treated COVID-19 patients. In an ICU study of COVID-19 patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by Doidge et al. [8] , a decline in 28-day mortality was noted from 43\u00a25% before the peak of the first pandemic wave to 34\u00a23% after the peak. A metaanalysis of Armstrong et al. [12] showed lower ICU mortalities in studies published April-May than in those published January-March. However, a large proportion of hospitalised COVID-19 patients are never admitted to ICU, and to our knowledge it has not been clarified if mortality has changed among non-ICU treated hospitalised patients. Karagiannidis et al. [5] reported no considerable change in mortality over time in a large German cohort of unselected hospitalised COVID-19 patients.",

Additionally, after adjusting for baseline patient characteristics, all healthcare regions except South-East were associated with higher mortality than the reference Stockholm-Gotland (Fig. 3) .

The survival curves showed a higher initial mortality rate for the March cohort than for the other months of admission, most clearly so for those admitted to ICU. As noted in Fig. 3 , the decrease in mortality remained throughout the study period with an adjusted RR of 0\u00a279 (95% CI, 0\u00a272 to 0\u00a285) in April, 0\u00a263 (95% CI, 0\u00a257 to 0\u00a269) in May, and 0\u00a246 (95% CI 0\u00a239 to 0\u00a254) post-wave, with March as reference. Accordingly it decreased in patients not treated in ICU with RR 0\u00a249 (95% CI, 0\u00a242 to 0\u00a259) post-wave, and in patients treated in ICU with RR 0\u00a249 (95% CI, 0\u00a233 to 0\u00a272) post-wave, with March as reference (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S2-S3) . Sensitivity analysis showed no impact on estimates for admission month when imputing missing data on country of birth as 'Sweden' or 'Outside Sweden' or imputing missing CCI as either of the two extreme values. Fig. 6 shows the crude 60-day mortality proportions over time by age categories, sex, CCI, care dependency, and country of birth. As noted, mortality decreased over the study period for all these levels of covariates, although the magnitude of change varied. However, when looking at different healthcare regions, greater variance in crude mortality over time was noted (Fig. 7) . Fig. 8 shows the adjusted RR for 60-day death of month of admission stratified by each covariate of interest, from the models including both main effect and interaction term. There was a significant interaction between month of admission and age, country of birth, care dependency levels, and healthcare region (p Joint test of interaction term all <0\u00a201). No interaction was found for sex or CCI levels. The magnitude of mortality change over time decreased with increasing age, consistently across age categories (Fig. 8) . In contrast, mortality by healthcare region showed strong regional heterogeneity; decline in 60-day mortality was most pronounced in the healthcare regions with the highest initial mortality, i.e. Stockholm-Gotland and Uppsala-\u20ac Orebro (Figs. 7 and 8). In contrast, there was no decline in 60-day mortality over time for the North region, and a very small decline if any, for South-East, West, and South (Fig. 8) . The 60-day mortality ranged from 15\u00a20% to 28\u00a20% in March, and between 10\u00a23% to 19\u00a21% in June across healthcare regions, and it further declined or stabilised post-wave (Fig. 7) .",

Reasons for differences in outcome are difficult to analyse since studies use different outcome definitions, provide different patient characteristics, and often include patients that are still treated in hospital. Importantly, the time period of inclusion is probably crucial for the overall mortality and for differences between studies, since the mortality has clearly been changing over time [25] . In the present study, the overall 60-day mortality declined from 24\u00a27% in March to 10\u00a24% post-wave, it declined correspondingly from 36\u00a21% to 21\u00a23% among ICU treated patients, and from 21\u00a29% to 9\u00a21% among non-ICU treated patients (Fig. 4) . In addition, adjusted 60-day mortality decreased significantly (Figs. 3 and 5) . Accordingly, both crude and adjusted 60-day mortality declined over time by age categories, sex, CCI, care dependency, and country of birth (Figs. 6 and 8) , However, the mortality dynamics over time varied between the Swedish healthcare regions (Figs. 7 and 8) . The reasons for these variations are not known, but a number of factors may have contributed to those and to the overall decline in mortality. First, improvements of management and care have probably been of great importance for the declining mortality. For instance, the present study shows that even though acute severity of illness (SAPS3 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) among ICU-treated patients remained unchanged over time, the proportion of patients managed in the prone position increased from March to May, and the proportion receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased considerably (Table 3) . Thus, respiratory care improved in ICU. In addition, the proportion receiving renal dialysis decreased, most likely due to improved circulation support. According to our experience, the respiratory care was significantly improved in hospital wards as well.",

Prior to that, corticosteroids were predominantly used on the ICU, and their use increased over the study period (Table 3) . However, the infrequent use of corticosteroid treatment in March-May suggests that corticosteroids were unlikely to be a major cause for the decline in mortality among ICU patients. Meanwhile, the decreased mortality post-wave compared to that of May-June among non-ICU treated patients (Figs. 3 and 5) could perhaps to some extent be explained by corticosteroids, which was then used as standard of care treatment in Sweden. Remdesivir became a treatment option in Sweden from the end of June 2020. As it was rarely used prior to that time point (Table 3) , Remdesivir use was most likely not a major cause of the declining COVID-19 mortality between March and June. However, it cannot be excluded that Remdesivir use could have influenced survival during the post-wave months (July-September). Second, the high load of new admissions and of patients in hospital care for COVID-19 in March and April (Fig. 2) may have contributed to the high initial mortality. This notion is supported by the result from healthcare region Stockholm-Gotland, which had the highest number of new COVID-19 admissions per resident in March-April (Supplementary Table S4 ) and also the most prominent decline in mortality. However, the message is complex, as Stockholm-Gotland region had the lowest mortality in June despite still having the highest rate of COVID-19 admissions per population (Supplementary  Table S4 ), and its adjusted overall RR of 60-day death was lower than that of four other regions (Fig. 3) .",

Demographic factors changed over time (Table 1) , the median age decreased and the proportion of patients without comorbidity (CCI zero) increased, although the proportion of patients living in nursing homes prior to admission increased. Importantly, the proportion of hospitalised COVID-19 patients that were admitted to ICU and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased substantially over time (Fig. 9 ) This may indicate that the overall hospitalised COVID-19 population was gradually less severely ill during the study period. This explanation is supported by an Italian study of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in the emergency department between March and May, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract gradually decreased and the proportion of patients requiring ICU care decreased over time [32] .",

For instance, in studies using mortality as endpoint, the timing of inclusion may play a crucial role regarding outcome. The results of before-and-after studies on specific interventions should thus be interpreted with caution. The impact of an intervention during a high-mortality period does not necessarily apply to the same intervention during a period with significantly lower mortality.

However, SAPS3 scores on ICU admission were constant throughout the study period, indicating that the criteria for ICU admission had probably not changed considerably. Third, we did not have access to data on drug therapy on wards during hospital stay, and thus we could not appropriately assess the impact of different drug therapy for outcome. Forth, the study lacked information on hospital bed occupancy and caregiver-to-patient ratio, which could have enabled further investigation of reasons for temporal as well as regional variation in mortality [36] . Fifth, the National Patient Register lacks information from primary care, hence the CCI may be underestimated.
