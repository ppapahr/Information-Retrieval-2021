            "text": "In a news recommender system, a reader's preferences change over time. Some preferences drift quite abruptly (short-term preferences), while others change over a longer period of time (long-term preferences). Although the existing news recommender systems consider the reader's full history, they often ignore the dynamics in the reader's behavior. Thus, they cannot meet the demand of the news readers for their timevarying preferences. In addition, the state-of-the-art news recommendation models are often focused on providing accurate predictions, which can work well in traditional recommendation scenarios. However, in a news recommender system, diversity is essential, not only to keep news readers engaged, but also to play a key role in a democratic society. In this PhD dissertation, our goal is to build a news recommender system to address these two challenges. Our system should be able to: (i) accommodate the dynamics in reader behavior; and (ii) consider both accuracy and diversity in the design of the recommendation model. Our news recommender system can also work for unprofiled, anonymous and short-term readers, by leveraging the rich side information of the news items and by including the implicit feedback in our model. We evaluate our model with multiple evaluation measures (both accuracy and diversity-oriented metrics) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.",

            "text": "With the advancement in internet technology, more and more news readers start to read news online. The news readers' preferences are not fixed and tend to change over time [1] . A reader's interests may be triggered by certain events or contexts [14] , for example, breaking news, weather alert, a political riot in the region and such. A reader's reading behavior is also affected by temporal factors such as the time of a day or the day of a week. For example, the highest news consumption usually happens in the evening from 6-8pm, followed by a peak at 7am or sometimes around the noon [15] . We refer to these types of dynamic interests as a user's short-term preferences. A news reader may also have long-term preferences. For example, a user who is a fan of Raptors (a basketball team) may have read many basketball news about this team consistently in the past. These long-term preferences are stable and may evolve over a long period of time, possibly due to the change in the user's personality or habits or the outside environment. Besides being long or short-term, reader preferences show sequential dependencies. For example, a news reader reads about 'COVID-19 emergency' at time t1, then his next action may be reading about 'COVID-19 recoveries' at t2, followed by 'Stock markets after pandemic' at t3. In this scenario, each of the reader's next actions sequentially depends on the prior ones.",

The traditional NRS may fail to capture the temporal dynamics (the phenomenon in which a user's preferences drift over time) in readers' preferences. Since these systems typically provide the recommendation according to the reader's full reading history, they may lose focus on the short-term preferences. Also, these systems often emphasize on high prediction accuracy. As a result, they are typically evaluated using accuracy metrics such as RMSE (root mean square error). High accuracy in a recommender system is generally associated with high personalization [9] , which is no doubt important. However, in an NRS, matching everything according to readers' preferences may have adverse effects. A news reader may only be exposed to the content that conforms to his existing preferences as a consequence. This will create an echo-chamber [9] around the user where he gets all the information echoing what he already thinks. At the society level, this will create a filter bubble around the like-minded news readers and they tend to isolate themselves from different viewpoints and perspectives [9] . For example, the readers in a filter bubble might only get news items that are aligned with their political beliefs, not the ones that contradict with them. Adding diversity can solve this problem to a certain degree.",

However, these models suffer from the data sparsity problem because of the limited reader interactions on the news platform. There are also anonymous or short-term users without any explicit profiling information. These readers may click a few or no news items displayed in a session. A possible solution is to exploit the rich information from items' metadata such as titles [19] . For example, the user representations are learnt from the browsed and matching candidate news titles. However, relying on a single piece of information such as titles may not be enough to learn accurate news and user representations. There are other pieces of information that may be more descriptive (e.g., the text of a news story) or that are better indicators of the reader's short-term or long-term preferences (e.g., topics, categories). Also, these models are accuracycentric (built to improve the recommendation accuracy), without considering diversity in the design of NRS.",

It favours users' short-term preferences, and the older data is often discarded. To determine the long-term preferences, the full user history is needed. This can be accomplished by models such as timeSVD++ [11] , in which the timeline of the user's preferences is split into static time bins. This model favours users' long-term preferences. There is another model [20] that combines both the long-term and short-term user preferences, however, time-decay is not considered in terms of item popularity and drifting user interests. There are also the graph-based methods, where users, items and the time factors are included as nodes, thus making a tri-partite graph [21] . An issue with graphbased models is that they rely heavily on content-based features that are not always available to the system and could be quite costly to collect.

A sequential recommendation task takes into account users' short-term interests with all interactions happening within a close proximity of time (i.e., in a session). Thus, news reading activity can be considered as a sequential task. The Markov model is a well-known sequence modeling technique, which has been used in NRS [3] . The Markov model represents sequential data as a stochastic process over discreate random states (variables) where every state depends on the previous state. A limitation of this model is that when including higher states, the computational complexity of the model is drastically increased. Another sequential modeling approach used in NRS is the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model with actions and rewards [23] , where the model dynamically adapts recommendations to future rewards. This model also suffers from the computational complexity problem brought by the growing states. Due to the importance of the sequential modeling to a recommender system, reducing complexity of these models is an ongoing research topic.",

The side information associated with either users or items plays a crucial role in this regard. The title, text body, category, subcategory, topics are all useful for representing news. Different type of side information contains different level of details, e.g., the full text of a news story is more descriptive than the title alone. We also find that news articles accessed by a reader during different time windows convey different types of information regarding his reading patterns. For example, if we analyze the full interaction history of a news reader, we may find the general likings of the reader on news such as Sports, Politics, Entertainment. If we analyze the interaction history in a session, we may find different sets of topics or words that reflect his sequential and short-term interests.",

If we link these ratings to the side information of the news items such as sources, topics, or categories, it would be easier to identify the pattern.

The Tikhonov regularization with 2 -norm (Ridge regression) is considered as de-facto regularization in this regard. It gives us the approximate solution to produce a lower (not exactly zero) mean squared error in predictions. However, we may utilize other forms of regularizations such as 1 -norm that chooses the highly correlated features from the data and gives more absolute solutions (close to zero). In this way, we sacrifice some level of accuracy at the cost of diversity. We can also control the relative balance and the intensity of these regularizations to get a trade-off. Although the usage of these regularizations is not novel, no previous work has applied both regularization terms to address the accuracy and diversity in a unified optimization framework. In our latent factor model, we test different form of regularization terms from the Ridge, Lasso and Elastic-net regressions.

The goal of this model is to predict the ratings of a news reader for the unrated news items and to make recommendations based on predicted ratings. We consider different combinations of time-varying factors to integrate the temporal dynamics. In that, we first include the main timestamp associated with the reader's rating as the baseline predictor, and then we supplement the varying time unit (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) along with the whole timestamp. The point is to capture either the rapidly changing effects (through fine-grained timing information as biases) or the steady temporal effects (through coarser time units as biases) in readers' behavior. We also add the category and the subcategory information in the baseline predictors. The category information is item-related, and it also reflects a news reader's long-term preferences.

Typically, in a real recommendation scenario, readers only have the patience to check the first 10 or 20 recommended results. So, our model works better in typical cases.

The explicit feedback is derived from the readers' comments (sentiment scores) on news items and is used in our MF and latent-factor GLM-based approaches. We consider the implicit feedback in our DL-based approach. A preliminary test on including both the explicit and implicit feedbacks showed us that results with implicit feedbacks are better than those without them. This is because in an NRS, a news reader may still read about a topic or a news story which he has not liked in the past, just for gaining knowledge, getting information, or learning the latest update on an event. Although the implicit feedback may bring some inaccuracy into the model as we discussed earlier, it is kind of aligned with the real-world scenario where people consume different news articles even if they don't like them.

Among the challenges of the news domain, we aim to address the most pressing ones (temporal dynamics, diversity and the data sparsity) in our work. The goal is to enhance the reader experience through the use of the NRS. We first address the temporal dynamics issue in user preferences. We learn both the long-term and short-term preferences of news readers. We also learn the sequential patterns from the reader's consumption history. Next, we include the diversity as the key design principle in the NRS. We propose to include different forms of regularization terms during the optimization phase to trade off accuracy with diversity. We find that it is important to retain the accuracy with the requisite level of diversity. For both the temporal dynamics and the diversity in the NRS, we adopt two different approaches: computationally simple, interpretable and linear models, and the DL-based model. We also evaluate our system using different criteria to check the results of our models from different perspectives.",

Specifically, we would like to know whether and how we should have more detailed considerations (e.g., a threshold for the level of accuracy and diversity) to address the accuracy-diversity dilemma in an NRS. We would like to investigate more on how to include diversity in the design of the recommendation model in our DL-based approach. We need to explore more on the issue of missing and negative implicit feedbacks. We also want our NRS to be a democratic recommender. For that, we need to consider other aspects such as assimilating bias, neutralizing polarization, or breaking filter bubbles. We also need to study various post-algorithmic effects from news recommenders on reader's behavior.",
