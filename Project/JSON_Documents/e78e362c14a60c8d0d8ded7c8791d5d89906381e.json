Especially, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is currently the only technique that enables tracing the structural anatomy of white matter tracts in the human brain. DMRI is sensitive to molecular water diffusion and can characterize subtle changes in the brain microstructure and measure structural connectivity abnormalities in the brain's white matter tracts [4] . Research concerning dMRI can analyze the white matter tracts and structural connectivity with a process called tractography [5] . Tractography is used to construct maps and diagrams of the brain's connectivity with high-resolution images to improve comprehension of the structure of the brain [16, 31, 37] . DMRI tractography has gained in popularity in clinical practice and research on brain diseases such as autism, multiple sclerosis, stroke, dementia, and schizophrenia [2, 47] . Moreover, dMRI tractography is a powerful tool to track and detect disruptions in structural connectivity regarding brain disease and disorders [20, 21] . For example, when comparing the brain connectivity between healthy and disease populations, it is critical to get deeper insights to understand the potential pathology. Tractography data needs interpretation to be useful, and therefore visualizations are required to understand the underlying tissue microstructure of fiber tracts. Highdimensional fiber tracking datasets consisting of tens of gigabytes in size with millions of fibers, and the spatial 3D characteristics yield fundamental challenges for data exploration and visualization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 500, "end": 503, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 808, "end": 811, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 981, "end": 984, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1139, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1143, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Tractography data can include millions of 3D polylines with each line representing the path of a single white matter tract.

Our goal is that users do not necessarily require a detailed understanding of complex relationships and patterns in the data. With FiberStars, users can generate and validate new hypothesis when comparing tractography of multiple subjects. To allow this, we use several levels of abstraction. We visualize large multi-subject datasets in a projection view that shows the overall distribution. We then introduce a compact 2D representation to create fingerprints for different subjects and fiber clusters. Finally, we support the combined visualization of 3D anatomy with our 2D representations across multiple subjects and multiple regions of interest.

The first dataset are dMRI scans from subjects suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [44, 52, 54] . High-resolution MR images were obtained on a Siemens 3T scanner at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA, with approval of the local ethics board. Multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired using a simultaneous multi-slice acquisition factor of 2 at a spatial resolution of 222 mm 3 with 70 gradient directions spread over the three b-value shells of 1000/2000/3000 s/mm 2 . Whole-brain tractography was conducted using the unscented Kalman filter tractography (UKF) method, as implemented in the ukftractography 1 package [33, 43, 45] . During fiber tracking, the following scalars were recorded, including the normalized signal estimation error, signal means, return-to-origin probability (RTOP), return-to-plane probability (RTPP), and the return-to-axis probability (RTAP). Those scalar measures are used to quantify various features of the three-dimensional diffusion process of water molecules in the brain. RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP are scalar indices assuming parallel cylinders modeling the brain's white matter tissue. Their values are therefore related to the mean tissue sizes when the axes of these parallel cylinders correspond to the orientation of the underlying axon bundle [40] . RTOP is the probability for molecules for zero-displacement between the application of two diffusion sensitizing gradients and is an indicator for restricted diffusion [2, 40] . RTOP belongs to a whole family of zero displacement probability measures, including RTAP and RTPP as well. In the analysis of these scalars derived with dMRI, they appear as specific biomarkers for indicating cellularity, size of cell bodies and processes, or presence of restricting barriers like myelin, which surrounds nerve cell axons [3] . In general, these scalars can reveal additional complementary information to dMRI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 165, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 166, "end": 169, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 722, "end": 726, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 727, "end": 730, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1389, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1563, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1567, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1912, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "dMRI Data, Tractography and Scalars."}, {"text": "Our second dataset is from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [49] .

Wholebrain tractography was also conducted using the UKF method, as in the ADHD data. During fiber tracking, the following scalars were recorded, including diffusion measures of the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and the hemisphere location. Changes in these diffusion scalars are considered to reflect alternations of the underlying tissue microstructures. Quantifying changes can be helpful for monitoring disease and abnormalities, for example, inflammation, cell death, changes in myelination, edema, gliosis, increase in connectivity of crossing fibers, or increases in extracellular or intracellular water and many more [6, 39] . Besides scalars, each fiber bundle contains cell data with properties such as embedding coordinate, cluster number, embedding color, total fiber similarity, and measured fiber similarity. Especially the total fiber similarity and measured fiber similarity in a fiber tract are of special interest in terms of crossing fiber bundle comparisons.

Firstly, a less distorting approach allows for more intuitive reasoning, especially when expanding the exploration process from smaller to larger numbers of scalars. For example, consider a domain expert primarily interested in the relationship between the following scalars: Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Estimated Uncertainty (EU). In this case, the MDS solution reduces to a simple, reasonable scatter plot-like layout to begin with. Adding or replacing scalars then allows forming an intuition on the impact of the different variables. To provide further guidance in the resulting layout consider adding artificial data points, which can be obtained by fully maximizing a single scalar while fixing all others to the minimum [51] .

While using their code, we noticed that transforming our dMRI files in the AFQ Browser, which requires a MatLab or JSON file format as input, we were only able to use fibers with 100 data points. As this is not possible and fibers always have a varying number of points, we needed to interpolate the points. The other conventional tool, Fiber Models (DiffRadar) by Mei et al. [35] , presents similar visualization paradigms. The author's main goals were to show the differences between DTI fiber datasets and providing an intra-cluster comparison. The software includes 2D and 3D views. Similarly to AFQ-Browser, the user interface shown in Figure 6 consists of four panels as well. The panels are a) a list of the fiber models, b) a 2-dimensional view, c) a heatmap view showing regions of differences, and d) selected fibers of interest from the views in b) and c), highlighted in a 3D fiber model. The authors use a twophase projection technique to map 3D fibers onto a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, which they tested on two datasets. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to select fibers from 3D to 2D. Their approach is to implement a density estimation on their projection of the fibers. All fibers were reparameterized so that they have the same number of vertices and orientation by using the LAMP technique. This approach has already been shown in [15, 42] . The authors implement Landmark MDS (LMS) by randomly selecting some subset of fibers that are used as landmarks and then compute in a 2D plane the squared distance of fiber to the landmark fibers. The authors want to reduce computational complexity by using this approach. Then a scatterplot is used to position similar fibers in a cluster next to each other. On the scatterplot, they apply a Kernel density estimation to produce a continuous 2D density map of the scatterplot.
