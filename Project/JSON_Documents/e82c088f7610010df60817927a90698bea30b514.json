            "text": "On 23 January 2020, with <400 accumulated confirmed diagnoses of coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) , an unprecedented lockdown that lasted for >10 weeks was established in the city of Wuhan, China. 1 Control measures enacted by local and national authorities included a travel ban; non-selective social-distancing policies; the obligation to wear masks; the extension of the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday; and the closure of schools, universities, factories, government offices and, ultimately, of all non-essential services. 2, 3 As a result of these measures, on 8 April, with just one new case of local transmission reported over the preceding 2 weeks, local authorities began to ease restrictions in Wuhan. 4 Meanwhile, the disease spread globally to become a pandemic and >50 000 people were infected and another 2500 died in Wuhan according to local authorities. 1, 5 Non-selective physical-distancing measures have substantially halted transmission of COVID-19 worldwide, giving extra time to the unprecedented global effort that is underway to find treatments and vaccines in a context of successive epidemic waves. [6] [7] [8] However, as various mathematical models predicted, uncontrolled community transmission might make it necessary to alternate periods of relaxation of measures with repeated periods of lockdown in the near and mid-term, with potentially devastating consequences for the public health and economy of countries. 9 In fact, Israel was the world's first country to reimpose lockdown in September 2020. 10 To put the economic consequences into perspective, the monthly losses during Wuhan's closure have been estimated at >52% of the 2019 first-quarter municipal gross domestic product. 11 The purpose of this study is to present an alternative approach to the design of social-distancing measures. In particular, we investigate the impact of age-selective physical-distancing measures focused on older age groups on the cumulative number of COVID-19-related deaths and the number of people in the active workforce in the setting of Wuhan. It is an exercise of a mathematical nature and, although the practical limitations are outlined in the discussion, the specific design and application of the measures are beyond the scope of this study.",

The importance lies in the fact that this reduction in contacts represents only 5% of the total, but its impact on the number of deaths is disproportionate due to the high mortality for the elderly. Scenario 4 revealed that additional specific interventions would have allowed an increase in the workforce returning to work by 800% in the age group of 20 years, 600% in the age group 30 years, 400% in the age group 40 years, 100% in the age group 50 years and 100% in the age group 60 years without an increase in the number of accumulated deaths compared with Scenario 2. Although this increase in workforce would have prolonged the duration of the epidemic by roughly an additional month ( Figure 5 , date axes), Figure 6 shows that the effective workforce is 400% relative to Scenario 2 even taking this factor into account. These findings have been summarized and plotted in Figure 6D , which specifically shows that, on the one hand, measures in Scenario 3 would have resulted in the same number of people at work but a lower death toll compared with the Wuhan lockdown (Scenario 2), whereas, on the other hand, Scenario 4 would have had a comparable death toll with Wuhan lockdown but a large increase in the workforce. Changing initial parameters in the sensitivity analysis had an impact on several aspects such as the size of the epidemic, but the overall trends were maintained and the age-selective measures of Scenarios 3 and 4 were shown to have beneficial effects independently of the parameter variations (Supplementary Material, pp. 18-20, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).",

In order to exemplify the possibilities of the model, we decided to use the Wuhan setting (Scenario 2) and then simulate the effect of different social-mixing-pattern interventions on the outbreak dynamics and workforce in a defined period of time. 1, 17 From a public-health point of view, the ideal objective of interventions would be to achieve the lowest number of infected patients and no deaths. We decided to fit our model to the official death toll, as it was considered more stable and reliable than the number of confirmed cases. 25, 26 Similarly, for a given number of cumulative deaths, the percentage of the workforce that could return to work as a result of the establishment of age-selective social-mixing measures directed at vulnerable age groups was considered a relevant measure of the economic efficacy of interventions.",

In an extreme situation, the relevance of the opportunity cost becomes palpable and the lowest opportunity cost in terms of saved lives is achieved when the available resources are allocated primarily to the most vulnerable groups. It is essential to design protocols with the best available evidence to guarantee individual protection and asepsis in interactions within age groups and vulnerable groups. 35 In the Wuhan lockdown (Scenario 2), our model accurately predicts the timescale of the outbreak, the number of deaths and their age distribution. 1, 19 However, we have found a higher number of infected individuals than reported by the Chinese authorities. 1 This issue has been previously highlighted by other authors and may be affected by changes in the definition of cases, health-system saturation, undetected subclinical or asymptomatic cases and lack of diagnostic tests. 16, 26 The study has several important limitations. On the one hand, with regard to practical issues, it is worth highlighting that this model focuses on a specific location (Wuhan) and does not explore the restrictions necessary to curtail the geographic spread of the virus. There are also social difficulties arising from keeping the elderly separated from the rest of the population for long time periods (i.e. difficulties in childcare if parents return to the workforce but schools remain closed), in addition to the direct negative medical consequences discussed above. On the other hand, there are additional technical limitations. First, despite the biological plausibility of the parameters we used, they may undergo changes as new evidence accumulates. Second, as it happened in the models on which we based our analyses, we assume that the latency period is equivalent to the incubation period. 16 Third, we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility and transmissibility between children and adults, although there are conflicting results regarding this issue. 32, 36 We also did not explicitly include individuallevel heterogeneity in contact, clustering of household transmission and nosocomial transmission. Fourth, we did not model the limited capacity of the health system/intensive care units (ICUs), as the official data from the Chinese government did not record daily or global ICU admissions/ COVID-case severity in Wuhan, and it should be kept in mind that long-term effects beyond May 2020 were not investigated. Finally, contact matrices were synthetic and, even though the official death toll is probably more stable and reliable than the official number of confirmed cases, it may also underestimate the actual number of deaths. As a result, there is a high level of uncertainty in the parameter values (including contact matrices), deaths data and the chosen model structure. Therefore, we carried out a sensitivity analysis for different values of R 0 , the start date of the outbreak, the number of initial patients and the ages of the first infected patients. Although contact matrices are synthetic, the constrained linear least-squares method used to fit the simulate scenarios to the available data yields more rigorous and realistic results than simply multiplying contact matrices by a fixed coefficient and provides added value over previous COVID-19 studies modelling socialdistancing or age-selective interventions. [7] [8] [9] 37 To conclude, our results suggest that age-selective interventions could achieve either a reduction on the death toll or an increase in the population working on site without a detrimental impact on the death toll for a comparable time period. However, the practical feasibility of such measures as well as their long-term effects remain to be investigated.",
