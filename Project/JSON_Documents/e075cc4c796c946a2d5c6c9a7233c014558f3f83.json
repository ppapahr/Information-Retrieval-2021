It is likely that the nature of the defect changes as the disease progresses. Early lung disease is characterized by intermittent bacterial infection and the onset of inflammation. Hallmarks of established lung disease include established bacterial infection with organisms living in biofilms, chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and progressive bronchiectasis. In the ~15 yrs since the CFTR gene was discovered, many ideas emerged to explain the link between mutations and lung disease. One hypothesis is that CFTR mutations alter the processing of cell surface asialoglycoproteins such that the CF epithelia are more suitable for bacterial attachment (17) . A second is that CFTR at the cell surface functions as a bacterial receptor for clearance by epithelial phagocytosis; mutant CFTR is unable to perform this function (28). A third hypothesis is that CFTR mutations cause increased NaCl and liquid absorption across epithelia, diminishing the ASL volume and impairing normal mucociliary clearance. As a secondary effect of impaired clearance, bacterial adherence and colonization of the airways begins (5, 6) . A fourth theory is that mutations in CFTR impair the normal ability of epithelia to modify the electrolyte composition of airway surface liquid (ASL) by reabsorbing NaCl (36). As a result, ASL ionic strength increases and this secondarily impairs the function of many endogenous antimicrobials (35, 36, 40) . Alterations in the composition of secretions from submucosal glands may contribute to dehydration of the ASL layer and increased viscosity of CF secretions (18, 19) . Furthermore, the trapped mucus may create an environment that is well suited for bacteria such as Pseudomonas to live as biofilms (33, 34) . In addition to primary or secondary CFTR-associated changes that lead to pulmonary disease manifestations, polymorphisms in other genetic loci may influence the CF phenotype (12, 29, 30) .

This may also cause the epithelium to be impaired. For example, the production of the collectins SP-A and D progressively declines with disease progression (27). Proteolytic enzymes, arising from CF airway secretions or resident bacteria, also cleave and inactivate many proteins and receptors involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, further impairing host defense. For example, Pseudomonas proteases cleave IgG and destroy its opsonic activity (13) . There is also evidence for host or pathogen derived enzymatic cleavage of transferrin, lactoferrin, and SLPI (7, 38) . Recently, Taggart et al demonstrated that the cysteine protease cathepsins B, L, and S, in concentrations that are present in CF secretions, degrade and inactivate HBD-2 (37). In addition, the protease rich environment of the CF airways has been recently shown to cleave TLRs-2 and -4 that may further impair innate immune signaling (15) . The exuberant production of mucus and DNA released from host cells and bacteria creates a complex anionic matrix that may also bind cationic antimicrobial proteins and further impair their activity. In summary, the single gene defect in CF causes complex primary and secondary host defense defects that initiate and then perpetuate progressive chronic lung disease. Understanding these defects may lead to improved treatment for CF lung disease. Emerging evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies suggests that airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion initiates the cascade of events that results in CF lung disease. Although regional differences may exist in the relative contributions of the superficial epithelium and glands to ASL volume depletion, a common sequence follows that is manifest by periciliary liquid volume depletion, concentration of mucins in the mucus layer, adhesion of the mucus layer to airway surfaces, delayed ciliary and cough-dependent clearance, inflammation perhaps without overt bacterial infection, and ultimately acquisition of bacterial infection and promotion of bacterial biofilms.

It is strongly recommended that this test be carried out in a center experienced in its performance, and that the only acceptable test is the pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test. Furthermore, Clconcentrations rather than Na + concentrations are regarded as more accurate for discriminating between CF and non-CF, though sweat Na + may still be used in some laboratories. The literature in regard to sweat Clconcentrations has varied somewhat. The older literature recommends a Clconcentration of 70 mmol/L as diagnostic of CF; these data are based on reference values obtained from PI CF patients during the 1960's, and do not include pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, or any recently described phenotypes (2) . In view of the increasing awareness of atypical and \"variant\" CF, a level > 60 mmol/L is now regarded as diagnostic for CF (1) . What is more difficult to interpret is a level less than 60 mmol/L, although in the context of a compatible phenotype, the higher the Clconcentration, the more suspicious of CF the clinician is likely to be. Somewhat arbitrarily, a level of between 40 and 60 mmol/L is regarded as a gray zone (previously 50-60 mmol/L), often including PS / atypical CF patients. Complementation with nasal potential difference (NPD) measures can be useful. NPD is now more widely available, has been standardized, and can be performed safely in all age groups, including neonates (3). NPD requires significant technical experience and validation for each center / operator, and across groups of sufficient patients and controls. The best evidence of CF is a raised basal PD consistent with increased Na + absorption across airway epithelia. Across 8 different sites in the US, Standaert et al found that patients with CF (n = 31) had a mean basal PD (mV) of -45.3+11.4 (vs -18.2+8.3 for non-CF). Similarly, a reduced or absent CFTR-mediated Clconductance (mV) was present in patients with CF (+3.2+3.5 as compared with -23.7+10.2 for non-CF). Despite these advances in NPD measurement techniques and standardization, difficulties arise in atypical CF patients who may have normal or high normal Na + transport (up to -30 mV), although usually such patients have reductions in CFTR-mediated Clconductance, intermediate between that of CF and non-CF (4). As a technical note, inflammation of the nasal mucosa renders the test very difficult to perform and interpret (it may cause a falsely low basal PD and apparently absent Clconductance because of loss of epithelial integrity). Finally, molecular testing demonstrating two \"CF-causing\" mutations (i.e. associated with altered CFTR synthesis from a premature termination signal, alternations in intron splice sites, or novel amino acid sequences) is strong evidence of CF (1) .

A central feature of the wounding response to liver injury is the transformation of resident stellate cells from a \"quiescent\" (normal) to an \"activated\" (injured liver) state ( Figure 1 ). Characteristics of this transition include morphologic and functional changes. Morphologic changes include loss of vitamin A, acquisition of stress bundles, and development of prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum (1) (2) (3) (4) . One of the earliest described and most prominent effects of stellate cell activation is production of increased quantities of extracellular matrix, including types I, III and IV collagens, fibronectin, laminin and proteoglycans, some of which are increased by greater than 50-fold (3). Further, the available evidence now indicates that the overall increase in extracellular matrix protein deposition typical of cirrhosis can largely be ascribed to excess production by stellate cells (5) . Thus, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on elucidating mechanisms underlying stimulation of fibrogenesis by stellate cells. A number of events, typically acting in concert, play a role in stimulating stellate cell fibrogenesis (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . For example, stellate cells produce chemotactic factors (14) , appear to be important in matrix remodeling (15) , and produce a number of \"vasoactive peptides\" (8, 9) , including the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 (ET-1) (9, 16).

Such therapies are targeted at reducing or removing the primary injury, modulation of stellate cell activation, stimulation of matrix degradation or stimulation of stellate cell death. For example, interferon gamma, a cytokine with potent immunomodulatory activity, has profound effects on multiple aspects of stellate cell activation. These data have led to clinical trials in humans in which interferon gamma is being examined in patients with fibrosis. Other specific, mechanism based, \"anti-fibrotic\" therapies are rapidly emerging. Liver disease is a major complication in many patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The precise prevalence of CFassociated liver disease (CFLD) is difficult to determine as no reliable method of diagnosis currently exists. Traditional measures of liver function do not correlate with the severity of liver disease and there is no specific CF genetic association. Thus the diagnosis is not usually made until cirrhosis or complications such as portal hypertension are established. While clinical and imaging studies may detect these late changes, and invasive liver biopsy, which is not always reliable, due to the focal nature of fibrotic changes might aid diagnosis, the challenge exists to develop a sensitive, reliable non-invasive assay to identify CF patients who are at risk of developing severe liver disease, which might also serve as a guide to monitoring progression or response to therapy. Although the basic mechanisms remain unclear, abnormal bile transport and biliary fibrosis implicate abnormal biliary physiology in the pathogenesis of CFLD.

The recent solution of the murine NBD1 at high resolution using X-ray diffraction methods provides the first such structural information (16) . The structure reveals that F508 is exposed on the surface of the NBD in an alpha-helical sub-domain. Replacement of the phenylalanine with any other amino acid has no measurable effect on the folding or final structure of the isolated NBD, indicating that it is the loss of the backbone that leads to inefficient NBD folding (17) . In contrast, charged or bulky side chains at the 508 position interfere with the the later steps in the folding of the full-length CFTR.

These results have implications for understanding the function of CFTR and the development of ligands to promote mutant CFTR folding for therapeutic benefit.

The possible involvement of the submucosal glands in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease suggests that cell-types other than ciliated cells may also require CFTR expression for normal function (1).

Western analyses performed 48 hrs after apical surface inoculation of CF HAE with hPIV-CFTR, hPIV expressing GFP (hPIV3-GFP) or vehicle control alone showed that only hPIV-CFTR produced expression of fully glycosylated \"Band C\" CFTR. Immunodetection of CFTR protein in histological sections of CF HAE inoculated with hPIV-CFTR localized CFTR to the apical surface of ciliated cells in regions corresponding to the microvilli of the ciliated cells. To determine whether CFTR expression in CF ciliated cells resulted in chloride ion channel activity, CF HAE were assayed in Ussing chambers after viral inoculation. Compared to control CF HAE (vehicle or hPIV-GFP treated), inoculation with hPIV-CFTR resulted in a significantly increased forskolin-mediated activation of CFTR chloride channel activity [1.5 \u00b1 0.1 _A/cm 2 for control (n = 18) and 23 \u00b1 2.5 _A/cm 2 for hPIV-CFTR (n = 9)].

In control CF HAE, the ASL stabilized at 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 _m (n = 12), a depth associated with decreased mucus transport.

A hallmark of CF lung disease is mucostasis, a parameter that is recapitulated in CF HAE. Therefore, to determine if the restoration of fluid transport to CF HAE by CFTR expression in ciliated cells was sufficient to allow the transport of mucus secretions, we measured the capacity of CF HAE to transport mucus after inoculation with hPIV-CFTR.

Cutting, MD Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD USA Genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors are the three major factors contributing to phenotype variation. For single gene disorders the nature of the defect in the disease-causing gene is a major contributor to variation. However, in most single gene disorders, including CF, the disease-causing gene is not the sole determinant of variation indicating an important role for the other major factors. This point is highlighted by the observation that cystic fibrosis patients with identical CFTR genotypes have considerable variability in the severity of lung disease (1). Study of related affected individuals provides a method to dissect the contributions of genetic background, environmental and stochastic factors to phenotype variability (2). This is achieved by comparing the degree to which monozygous (MZ) twins, dizygous (DZ) twins and siblings are similar to each other for selected traits. If pairs of MZ twins are found to be highly correlated (e.g. if one member of the twin pair has a trait; the other twin also has the trait) then one could attribute this similarity to genes (since they share 100% of their genes) or the environment that they share (since they are together in utero and grow up together in the same household). If DZ twins are examined for the same trait and found to have lower rates of correlation than MZ twins, then genetic factors can be implicated since DZ twins share only 50% of genes but have the same degree (or nearly so) of shared environment as MZ twins. On the other hand, similar high levels of correlation among MZ and DZ twins implicates the environment that they share. Finally, siblings share 50% of genes like DZ twins but have a lower degree of shared environment since they are born at different times (although still raised in the same household).

Rather than acting alone, PKC phosphorylation seems to regulate CFTR gating primarily by enhancing the rate and magnitude of its response to PKA, effects which are most noticeable in patches after channel activity has been allowed to run down. PKC phosphorylation of CFTR channels in vivo is undoubtedly regulated by hormones and/or transmitters but appears partially \"constitutive\" in cultured cells, perhaps a reflection of high PKC activity in cells soon after they are removed from medium containing serum and its growth factors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S15.1 PROTEIN KINASE-INDEPENDENT ACTIVATION OF CFTR BY PHOSPHOLIPIDS"}, {"text": "CFTR regulation is often studied using potent activators (eg forskolin, cpt-cAMP, phorbol esters, etc), but to assess the physiological role of a pathway it is preferable to expose cells to a \"first messenger\" (eg VIP, acetylcholine, neurokinin) and block the pathway of interest. Pharmacologic inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, dominant-negative mutants and small interfering RNAs have all been used in various preparations, although specificity is always a concern. Chelerythrine and G\u00f66976 were both used to establish the role of PKC in stimulation of CFTR by PKA 3 , but it is now clear that chelerythrine is less potent and less specific than G\u00f66976 or the other bisindoylmaleimides (eg BIS1 or BIS10 4;5 ) and should be avoided. Interactions between signals could arise if an agonist activates more than one pathway or if multiple secretagogues stimulate the cell simultaneously. The role of such interactions in regulating CFTR has not been studied but may be important in vivo since several transmitters are often co-released and cells also receive inputs from circulating hormones and locally-generated agonists such as ATP, adenosine and NO. Sorting out the relative contributions and crosstalk between these signals remains a major challenge, however a key factor will probably lie in the subcellular localization of receptors and signaling molecules. The fact that phorbol esters have opposing actions at the apical and basolateral membranes itself implies that transport is controlled by multiple PKC isozymes having restricted distributions. PKC signaling involves activation by phospholipid and/or calcium, translocation to the site of action (eg plasma membrane), and binding to a receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) 6 . RACKs are ideally suited to orchestrate localized signaling responses because they are located near PKC sub-strates and are specific for particular PKC isozymes. During secretion, basolateral uptake of chloride into human tracheal cells by sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters is regulated by the PKC_ and PKC_ whereas apical chloride channels in the Calu3 cell line are regulated by PKC_ 7;8 . PKC_ binds to RACK1, which in turn binds the scaffolding protein EBP-50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin binding phosphoprotein of 50 kD); 9 ). Regulation of these associations appears complex since phosphorylation of a PKC site on the PDZ1 domain of EBP-50 can disrupt the PDZ1-CFTR interaction 10 . Together these findings raise the possibility that when activated, PKC could potentially regulate its own targeting to CFTR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1742, "end": 1743, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2142, "text": "7;8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2432, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S15.1 PROTEIN KINASE-INDEPENDENT ACTIVATION OF CFTR BY PHOSPHOLIPIDS"}, {"text": "Finally, choosing the right preparation will be important for physiological studies of PKC signaling as cell lines may differ in their expression of receptors, anchoring proteins, PKC isozymes, and apical-basolateral polarization. Using first messengers rather than artificial activators such as phorbol esters should minimize artifacts caused by hyperstimulation, and isozyme-specific translocation inhibitor and activator peptides are available which act specifically on PKC_ or other PKC isozymes. These tools in combination with mutant channels that lack PKC sites but are fully competent for gating (eg the \"6CA revertent\" mutant 11 ) should provide new insights into the regulation of CFTR by PKC. CFTR is a chloride channel in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family and contains its defining features, two membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (1, 2) . Like other ABC transporters CFTR can bind and hydrolyze ATP. Earlier work has shown that enzymatic activity is required for normal channel gating (3, 4) . But this has long seemed puzzling because ion flow is passive without a fixed stoichiometric relationship to ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, no other ion channel is known to require the energy of ATP hydrolysis for gating. Therefore we asked whether CFTR had another ATPdependent enzymatic activity that released less energy. In previous work we found that a recombinant NBD2 polypeptide had ATPase activity (ATP ( ADP + P i ) in the presence of ATP alone. But when AMP was also present, the NBD2 polypeptide functioned as an adenylate kinase (ATP + AMP ( ADP + ADP) and its ATPase activity was suppressed (5) .

When functioning as an adenylate kinase, CFTR showed positive cooperativity for ATP suggesting its two nucleotide-binding domains may dimerize. Thus, channel activity could be regulated by two different enzymatic reactions, ATPase and adenylate kinase. Both activities share a common ATP binding-site in the second nucleotide-binding domain. Our data indicate that it is the interaction of AMP with the AMP-site that induced adenylate kinase activity and suppressed ATPase activity. The AMP K m of 73\u00b120 \u00b5M for CFTR gating suggests that CFTR will function as an adenylate kinase in vivo. Thus, at physiologic nucleotide concentrations adenylate kinase activity, rather than ATPase activity may control gating, and therefore involve little energy consumption.

ATP-dependent gating of CFTR is studied in inside-out membrane patches excised from NIH3T3 or CHO cells heterologously expressing wild-type or mutant CFTR. The opening rate of the channel follows a simple Michaelis-Menten function and the closed time histograms show a negative exponential component (Zeltwanger et al., 1999) .

There also seems to be a consensus that the response to infection in the CF airway is dysregulated and excessive (1) . Several studies in mice with CFTR mutations have shown excessive responses to the prototypic inducer of inflammation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Most investigators have reported that huge quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and low molecular chemoattractants are found in lung secretions of CF patients, mice with mutations in CFTR that have been challenged with LPS or bacteria, and the supernatants of cultured cells with defective or blocked CFTR. Decreased production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as lipoxins (2) and IL-10 (3) is also likely to be important in the dysregulation of the inflammatory response in the CF lung. There is considerable evidence that the NF-B dependent proteins, TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 are over-produced in CF and contribute to both intrapulmonary and systemic morbidity (reviewed in 3). The major inflammatory effector cell in the CF airway is the neutrophil (PMN). Besides a role for IL-1 and TNF in priming PMN, they induce expression of adherence molecules which facilitate migration of PMN into the airway; and IL-8 is itself an important chemoattractant. Additional chemoattractants important in CF are the lipoxygenase product, LTB 4 , and the complement fragments C5a and C5a desarg (3, 4) . The PMN themselves contribute additional LTB 4 . More importantly, PMN products including active proteases, long stranded DNA, and oxidants all have deleterious effects on airway function and structure which are out of proportion to their necessary role in controlling infection. These PMN products contribute to airway obstruction, induce NF-B activation and additional pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and impair phagocytic defense mechanisms. Thus, the PMNs initiate and perpetuate a vicious cycle of infection, inflammation and airway destruction which eventually claims the life of the patient (3,4).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1642, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1645, "text": "4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Rainbow Babies and Childrens' Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio"}, {"text": "The paradigm above illustrates an array of targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. The role of infection as the major stimulus for the inflammatory process emphasizes the importance of controlling infection and reducing the burden of bacteria with antibiotics and airway clearance techniques/therapies. Numerous studies have documented decreases in inflammatory mediators after \"cleanouts\", confirming the importance of limiting this stimulus. While we all hope that correction of the basic defect will terminate the cycle of infection and inflammation, if chronic infection and airway damage are already established, this may not be possible. Inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways such as the I-B/NF-B pathway or correction of putative CF-related dysregulation of this pathway would reduce many of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and would thus hit many lung and systemic targets by reducing TNF and IL-8 (3). Aspirin, NSAIDS, and corticosteroids all inhibit NF-B activation (5, 6) , and ibuprofen and prednisone have shown beneficial effects in CF (7, 8) . The pleotropic effects of cytokines might suggest that inhibiting any individual pro-inflammatory cytokine may not be very effective. However, inhibition of TNF alone has been very effective in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which has several features in common with CF, especially the role of PMN in destruction of the end organ (9) . Interestingly, methotrexate, the mainstay of RA treatment, has shown promising effects in small studies in CF (10) . Inhibiting production of individual pathways like 5-lipoxygenase is also possible, and inhibitors of individual chemoattractant receptors are being studied. Although preventing the PMN influx might seem to be a better strategy than attempting to neutralize their products one-by-one, the success of DNAase illustrates the efficacy of the latter approach. Similar efforts could be directed at elastase and PMNderived oxidants. In evaluating anti-inflammatory therapy in CF, it is important to differentiate short-term improvement in symptoms from long-term preservation of lung function (11) . A two-tiered approach is envisioned by the CFF TDN AIM program, in which preliminary 30 day studies looking for efficacy in reducing inflammatory mediators in induced sputum will be used as a screening tool to select the best agents for larger, long-term studies of efficacy in preventing loss of lung function. This strategy offers our best chance of fairly evaluating new agents. Any time one contemplates interfering with inflammatory mechanisms that also play important roles in host defenses, there is fear of allowing infection to get out of control. This has not occurred in trials of ibuprofen or corticosteroids in CF, but problems with infection, particularly activation of old TB in patients over 65, have been seen with the use of TNF inhibitors in RA (9) . Some of the concerns with these agents and other anti-inflammatories may be relevant to CF, but some may not. Adverse effects frequently occur in organs other than the lung and may or may not be related to that mechanism of action of the drug which is believed to be important in CF. Observation of the latter should lead to development of more specific agents in which the therapeutic effect is maintained while the action(s) causing the adverse effects is eliminated. Specifically modifying the drug and/or route of delivery to decrease access to sites of toxicity while preserving effects on the therapeutic targets is the principle behind the use of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, but these drugs seem to have only limited efficacy in CF. Just as the long-term therapeutic effects must be considered, long-term adverse effects must also be weighed. It is particularly worrisome that \"catch-up\" growth has not occurred in CF patients who were given prednisone in earlier trials (12) . Although there are many reasons to believe that anti-inflammatory therapy should a part of every CF patient's regimen, recent CFF surveys suggest that use of these agents, particularly ibuprofen, is actually decreasing. This seems ironic in the face of the confirmation of the efficacy of ibuprofen presented by Schlucter et al at this meeting. Development of newer strategies, realistic assessment of the risk of adverse effects, development of better targeted agents, and better understanding of the role of inflammation in lung damage are all necessary for determining the appropriate place for anti-inflammatory therapy in CF.

The medical consequences of delayed diagnosis in CF can be thought of as short term or long term. In the short term, infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) are subject to a wide range of complications if diagnosis is delayed. The most striking complications are related to severe nutritional deficiencies and to hypoelectolytemia. Infants with CF can present with severe protein calorie malnutrition closely resembling Kwashiorkor. These infants have low albumin levels, edema, anemia and hepatomegaly from steatosis. They are also developmentally delayed at diagnosis. Trace metal deficiencies have also been described including severe zinc and selenium deficiencies. Zinc deficiency is associated with severe, weeping rash and immune dysfunction. Selenium deficiency can lead to congestive heart failure. Deficiency of alpha tocopherol, fat soluble vitamin E, is associated with severe anemia. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to intracerebral hemorrhage. (1) Linoleic acid deficiency likely coexists with other severe nutritional abnormalities and can cause rash. Hypoelectrolytemia can lead to lethargy, poor intake and seizures. A death related to hypoelectolytemia and seizures in an infant with unsuspected cystic fibrosis has been reported. (2) The causes of nutritional deficiency and hypoelectolytemia in infants with CF are well understood and help explain the short term consequences of delayed diagnosis. Because of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, fat and protein malabsorption occur in most infants by two months of age. (3, 4) Trace element metabolism is also abnormal by two months of age.

We also know that impaired weight gain after birth is correlated with malabsorption. Hypoelectolytemia arises from sweat electrolyte loss. Sweat electrolytes are abnormally high in CF within a week after birth. Early diagnosis rather than delayed diagnosis along with treatment of pancreatic insufficiency and supplementation of salt intake might therefore avoid short term complications of CF in infancy. Two lines of evidence support this notion. The most important evidence that early diagnosis and treatment can avoid complications in infants with CF comes from the Wisconsin trial of newborn screening. This trial has clearly demonstrated that growth is improved in the short term (as well as the long term) in infants identified through newborn screening compared to those identified after symptoms appear. (5) The second line of evidence stems from observational studies of infants identified through newborn screening showing that nutrient levels and growth improve with treatment. Impaired growth is a long term consequence of that CF that is clearly related to delayed diagnosis. (5) Since improved pulmonary outcome in CF has been related to improved growth, (6, 7) it might be expected that delayed diagnosis could lead to worse pulmonary outcome. The one study that has looked at this carefully however showed worse pulmonary outcome in patients identified through newborn screening compared to those with delayed diagnosis.

Optimal standard of care in most cases requires meeting the excess energy, protein and vitamin needs of CF patients via overcoming malabsorption with appropriate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), the use of oral supplements, sometimes helped by behavioral therapy, and /or, in some cases, enteral nutrition supplements (EN). There are, however, some CF -related complications , where conventional nutritional support is not enough, may fail, or is impossible to maintain. These include neonatal meconium ileus with consequent short bowel syndrome, CF related liver disease with liver synthetic dysfunction, severe lung disease with frequent exacerbations, chronic lung disease or pulmonary failure, CFrelated diabetes, and some cases of poor intake and/or compliance, particularly if these are manifest during critical phases of growth such as infancy or adolescence. Various adjuncts to nutritional therapy have been studied and may be considered in these circumstances (1) . Firstly, maximising PERT with acid suppression or increasing duodenal bicarbonate may enhance absorption of nutrients (2, 3) .However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival (4). Secondly, enhancing EN with specific supplements, eg trophic factors such as glutamine for short bowel syndrome (5), and branched chain amino acids for liver disease may give added benefit (6) . Thirdly, improved protein turnover, and efficiency of energy/fuel use and consequent wight gain and growth may be achieved by adjunctive growth hormone therapy (7) . Other adjuncts, such as IGF-1, and megestrol acetate have been evaluated with more variable outcomes. .Finally, where EN is inadequate, or impossible, the use of parenteral nutrition may be necessary, and has documented benefits (10) . The latter is particularly useful in pre-lung transplant patients, where improving/ maintaining nutrition may have an important bearing on outcomes. Questions as to when and how these various adjuncts are best utilised are at present incompletely answered, but it does appear that any or all approaches are preferable to continuing to starve the

In the randomized, controlled trial, the study investigators were informed of a positive neonatal screen (Immunoreactive trypsinogen [IRT] in the first six years of the study and IRT/DNA in the last three years of the study) for patients in the early diagnosis group. The study investigators informed the primary care physician of the positive newborn screen and the infant was brought to Madison or Milwaukee (the two study centers) for sweat testing at six weeks of age. In July 1994, CF newborn screening was added to the panel of routine neonatal screening tests. Over the past decade, we have learned the following lessons from the routine CF newborn screening program. 1 1. Initially in the routine neonatal screening program, the newborn screen collection card had a check-off box for meconium ileus. If this box was checked, then DNA analysis for the \u2206F508 mutation was performed regardless of the trypsinogen level. The rationale for this was to detect CF patients who theoretically could have a low trypsinogen level after surgery for meconium ileus. However, in the first 3 1/2 years of the routine CF newborn screening program, there were a total of 1266 infants in which meconium ileus was checked on the newborn screening specimen card. The staff at newborn nurseries were possibly checking this box erroneously for meconium stained amniotic fluid. In confirmed cases of CF with meconium ileus, there were no infants in which the trypsinogen level was less than the cut-off value. Therefore, the meconium ileus box on the newborn screening form was removed. 2. Initially in the routine newborn screening program, the written recommendation for an infant with a positive CF newborn screen was to have a sweat test performed at four weeks of age. Although the two CF Centers in the state of Wisconsin were listed on the report, it was not explicitly stated that sweat testing should occur at a CF Center. This led to two difficulties: a. Families were required to wait until the baby was four weeks of age for a sweat test. During this time, they encountered anxiety about the possibility that their child could have CF. b. A number of sweat tests were performed at hospitals that were not CF Centers. This led to questions about the accuracy of the sweat testing procedure. Additionally, families were not receiving genetic counseling in these non-CF Center settings.These issues were addressed by revising the positive CF neonatal screening report. The report no longer states that the infant should be four weeks of age for a sweat test and, therefore, there is now less of a delay from the time that the primary care physician notifies the family of the positive newborn screening test until the time that a sweat test is performed. Additionally, the newborn screening report now states that a quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test should be performed at CF Centers or Affiliate Centers listed on the report. As a result of these changes, in the calendar year 2003, there was only one infant who had a sweat test outside of a CF Core Center or Affiliate Center. 3. We are aware that families are anxious when they learn that their infant has a positive neonatal screen (specifically, an elevated trypsinogen and one CF mutation).To help allay the parents' anxiety 2 , a letter has been created that accompanies the positive CF newborn screening report to the primary care physician. This letter is intended to be given to the parents and emphasizes that there is only a possibility of cystic fibrosis. The letter briefly describes the sweat test and that no special preparation is needed. Contact information for the CF core and affiliate centers and the state newborn screening coordinator is provided. Additionally, the letter directs the parents to a website that we have created that provides useful information about CF newborn screening <http://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/childrenshosp/CF/nbs.html>. Within this website is a video entitled \"Understanding Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis\". All of these educational efforts have significantly decreased the number of phone calls that we receive from panicked parents. 4. From our experience in the CF newborn screening program, it is clear that the traditional decision levels for sweat chloride (<40 mEq/L is normal, 40-60 mEq/L is borderline, and >60 mEq/L is diagnostic of cystic fibrosis) is not applicable to infants. We have demonstrated that sweat chloride levels of >30 mEq/L in an infant is suspicious for CF. Extended mutation analysis in infants with a sweat chloride of >30 mEq/L almost invariably reveals two CF mutations. This agrees with previous data. 3 5 . Infection control measures are of utmost importance, as clinic exposures in a small waiting room (110 sq. ft.) was a risk factor for acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 5 6. CF newborn screening has evolved from an algorithm of IRT/\u2206F508 analysis to IRT/multiple (25) mutation", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 161, "text": "April 15, 1985 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 162, "end": 175, "text": "June 30, 1994", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 311, "end": 316, "text": "[IRT]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 853, "end": 854, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4831, "end": 4832, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4833, "end": 4834, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "ciated with insulin deficiency and resistance to insulin's anti-catabolic effects on whole body protein turnover.

Most people with CF make some insulin, thus they often do not require as much basal insulin as people who have diabetes but do not have CF. However, protein catabolism is higher in malnourished patients; therefore basal insulin is an important part of the insulin regimen in these patients. In general a starting dose which minimizes the risk of hypoglycemia is 0.1 units per kilogram of weight per day. This dose should be increased as needed, but hypoglycemia should be avoided.\u2022 Correction: When the blood glucose level is too high, rapid-acting insulin is given in addition to the usual insulin dose to \"correct\" the blood glucose level.
