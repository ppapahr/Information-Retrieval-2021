NSAID users (defined as individuals having filled a prescription for NSAIDs up to 30 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test) were matched to up to 4 nonusers on calendar week of the test date and propensity scores based on age, sex, relevant comorbidities, and use of selected prescription drugs. The main outcome was 30-day mortality, and NSAID users were compared to non-users using risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy. A total of 9,236 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive individuals were eligible for inclusion. The median age in the study cohort was 50 years, and 58% were female. Of these, 248 (2.7%) had filled a prescription for NSAIDs, and 535 (5.8%) died within 30 days. In the matched analyses, treatment with NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82, p = 0.95; RD 0.1%, 95% CI \u22123.5% to 3.7%, p = 0.95), risk of hospitalization (RR 1.16, 95% CI",

Because of this letter and case reports of otherwise healthy young patients with severe COVID-19 who had used NSAIDs in the early stage of disease [2] , concerns regarding the safety of NSAID use during the COVID-19 pandemic were widely circulated, including warnings against NSAID use in COVID-19 from the French health minister [2] and the World Health Organization. However, the European Medicines Agency stated that evidence to support warnings against use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 was lacking and stressed the need for further evidence on any effects of NSAIDs on disease prognosis in COVID-19 [3] .",

For viral illness, use of NSAIDs was not associated with mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with influenza H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic [8] , and a recent study found that use of NSAIDs was not associated with mortality in patients hospitalized for influenza [9] . As use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs is widespread, data on their safety are urgently needed to guide clinicians and patients on how to use NSAIDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore examined whether use of NSAIDs prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality compared to non-use of NSAIDs.",

Filled NSAID prescriptions were identified from the Danish National Prescription Registry, with information on all dispensed prescriptions at community pharmacies in Denmark since 1995 [19] . Users of NSAIDs were compared to individuals without NSAID use in the corresponding time window. In Denmark, NSAIDs are sold by prescription except for low-dose (200 mg) ibuprofen sold over-the-counter in pack sizes of no more than 20 tablets. In 2018, over-the-counter purchases of ibuprofen constituted 15% of total ibuprofen sales and a smaller proportion of total NSAID sales [20] . Hence, the potential to identify NSAID use from the Danish National Prescription Registry is high compared to many other countries where over-the-counter use of NSAIDs is common [19, 21] .",

PSs were estimated on the day of the positive SARS-CoV-2 test using logistic regression. Independent variables in the PS model were age, sex, relevant comorbidities, use of selected prescription drugs, and phase of the outbreak. For details of these independent variables, see S2 Appendix. A separate PS was estimated for each exposure definition in the main and supplementary analyses. To evaluate the appropriateness of the model, PS distributions were plotted separately for each cohort and overlap assessed visually. To reduce unmeasured confounding, individuals in the tails of the PS distribution were trimmed asymmetrically [23] . Up to 4 non-users were matched to each NSAID user using a nearest neighbor algorithm. Non-users could be matched to multiple NSAID users, and the maximum allowed difference in the PS between matches was 0.05 [24] . The Danish SARS-CoV-2 test strategy was subject to marked changes from a limited capacity setting in the beginning of the study period to a setting where widespread testing was available at the end of the study period. To account for this [25] , we included calendar week of the test date as a forced matching variable. This decision was made post hoc, i.e., not included in the protocol.

With the limited availability and use of NSAIDs over-the-counter in Denmark, misclassification from over-the-counter purchases of NSAIDs is of less concern [19] . However, exposure misclassification may still be present since information on adherence, intended duration, and dose was not available. Some patients do not use NSAIDs continuously after filling a prescription, and consequently some of these patients will have been incorrectly classified as NSAID users at the time of the positive test for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that a patient had filled a prescription for an NSAID may be considered an indicator of availability of NSAIDs rather than of actual use of NSAIDs. As information on exposure status was collected prior to our outcomes of interest, the misclassification is nondifferential and may introduce a bias towards the null. This could lead to wrongly dismissing a causal detrimental effect of NSAIDs on the prognosis of COVID-19 if many NSAID users truly were non-users. The time of cohort entry was defined by the SARS-CoV-2 test date because information on time of symptom onset was not available. Thus, the timing of NSAID use relative to cohort entry will not necessarily reflect NSAID use in the early course of COVID-19 disease.",
