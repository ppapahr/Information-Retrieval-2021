In addition, 40% of patients who initially presented with or progressed to LRTI died due to respiratory illness within 90 days of diagnosis. The progression rate to LRTI and the mortality rate by respiratory failure of LRTI patients were similar to the findings of previous studies, 12-35% and 17-47%, respectively [4-7, 10, 12] . The immunodeficiency risk score developed here using previously known and prevalent risk factors [6-10, 12, 15] distinctly differentiates low, moderate, and high risk groups among patients who have hematologic malignancy with or without HCT and also within the subgroup of HCT recipients. Oral ribavirin showed no effect on the prevention of PIV-associated death in any risk group, even after stratification by dosage. Shah et al. [15] previously reported a score model for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection among HCT recipients to predict progression to LRTI and RSV-associated mortality combining known risk factors for immunodeficiency. PIV has comparable mortality and morbidity to RSV in immunocompromised patients, yet it differs in that a substantial portion of LRTI patients initially present with LRTI at the time of diagnosis [10] . Moreover, although previous studies have investigated risk factors for progression to LRTI and PIVassociated mortality in HCT recipients [7] [8] [9] [10] , to our knowledge, this study is the first to develop a score model to predict PIV-associated mortality among patients with hematologic malignancy with or without HCT. Steroid use has been consistently suggested as a significant risk factor of progression to LRTI and PIV-associated mortality in many studies in a dose-dependent fashion, especially at a dose of more than 1 mg/kg [7, 9, 10, 13, 15] . However, in the present study, steroid dose was mostly under 1 mg/kg (median, 0.33 mg/kg; IQR, 0.19-0.63 mg/kg), and only those who received steroids before or at PIV diagnosis were deemed to have this factor, which might have led to the result that steroid use was not significant in both univariable and multivariable analyses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 510, "text": "[4-7, 10, 12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 610, "end": 624, "text": "[6-10, 12, 15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 944, "end": 948, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1506, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1510, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1514, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1519, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1904, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1907, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1911, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1915, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1919, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Ribavirin, oral or aerosolized, has been shown to be efficacious for RSV treatment in HCT recipients [16] , especially in the high risk group [15] . However, for PIV, except in several small studies [11, 14, 17] , retrospective studies have not shown either oral or aerosolized ribavirin to prevent progression to LRTI and [7-10, 12, 13] . In the present study, oral ribavirin did not significantly reduce PIV-associated mortality in any risk group regardless of dosage. This finding is consistent with our previous study using propensity score matching to offset selection bias, which revealed that in hematologic malignancy patients with paramyxovirus infection, ribavirin was not associated with better outcomes [13] . Interestingly, more patients died in the ribavirin group in the moderate risk group at doses of under 15 mg/kg and over 20 mg/kg. The reason for these counterintuitive findings is unclear. However, selection bias may play a role. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of an adverse effect of oral ribavirin therapy in critically ill patients with PIV infection. It is noteworthy that Fludase (DAS181, Ansun BioPharma, Inc., San Diego, CA), a sialidase fusion protein, was efficacious against PIV in vitro and in small studies with HCT recipients [18] [19] [20] [21] .
