This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis.
