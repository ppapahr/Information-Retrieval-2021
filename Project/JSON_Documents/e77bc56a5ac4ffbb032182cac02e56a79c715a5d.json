Pulmonary infections have various etiologies and have variegated patterns on radiographs and computed tomography (CT). Imaging plays an important role in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of various lung infections. Radiographs can be normal or non-specific during the initial evaluation, and CT findings may be more definitive. CT not only helps with the diagnosis but can also aid in management by guiding the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The pulmonary infections spread by direct or indirect contact with the infected host, droplet transmission, or an airborne spread. In rare cases, some infections can also be transmitted by vectors, namely, insect or animal hosts, and rarely by direct invasion from nearby infected organs. Pulmonary infections may have typical imaging patterns and distribution based on the mode of spread. There are a number of well-described imaging patterns of alveolar infections. The localization and morphological features on imaging may help in the diagnosis of infection and identification of mode of infection and, in certain cases, the microorganism responsible for the infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Patterns of Lung Infections", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "6.2"}, {"text": "Consolidation is a typical pattern of a lung infection on a radiograph of the chest, usually initiating as a small focus close to the fissures.

Lobar pneumonia results in a homogenous opacity, limited by the fissures and without any associated volume loss. There may be the presence of \"air bronchograms\" that result from relative sparing of the bronchi, appearing as dark air-filled linear spaces within the exudate-filled alveoli. Lobar pneumonia usually has surrounding ground-glass opacities, better seen on computed tomography (CT), and can have associated complications like an abscess, pleural effusion, or empyema. The opacification of an entire lobe is uncommon nowadays due to early antibiotic treatment, which stops the progress of the infective process. Some cases of lobar pneumonia have typical imaging patterns (Table 6 .1) (Fig. 6. 3) [2, 3] . However, one should remember that consolidation is not diagnostic of infection and can also be seen in other conditions like pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, organizing pneumonia, vasculitis, and even malignancies. A unique pattern of lung infection, generally seen in children younger than 12 years of age, is called \"round pneumonia\" [4] . This pattern of infection is seen in children due to lack of development of interalveolar connections and collateral airways. Typically, occurring as a solitary lesion, these are usually due to bacterial infection, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumonia. Round pneumonia can be seen on a chest radiograph as rounded nodular opacity with illdefined margins, commonly involving the superior segments of the lower lobes.

The most common causes of bronchopneumonia include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, some fungi, and anaerobes. The appearance of bronchopneumonia on radiograph depends upon the stage and may range from multifocal ground-glass opacities to consolidations. The opacities are usually asymmetric in distribution and may predominantly involve the lung bases. The pattern is better appreciated on computed tomography (CT) scans. Usual CT features include focal bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodularity, and multifocal opacities around the bronchioles, which can also be associated with tree-in-bud appearance [5] .
