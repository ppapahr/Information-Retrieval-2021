Furthermore, high resolution telecoms data for the entire population were available for analysis of mobility and proximity patterns.

As of early 2021, given the lack of e\u21b5ective therapeutics or widely distributed vaccines, Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) remain the primary public health strategies for achieving these goals [10, 23] . While several COVID-19 vaccines are being o\u21b5ered to European and global populations in early 2021, it might take significant time for vaccinations to accomplish 'herd immunity' and thereby significantly a\u21b5ect the trajectory of the pandemic. Furthermore, many countries in the developing world will likely not reach adequate levels of vaccination until 2022 or later [37] . It is therefore fair to asses that alongside vaccination e\u21b5orts, NPIs will continue to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 for the foreseeable future.",

Economic lockdowns, border closures and mobility restrictions are clearly e\u21b5ective to some degree in curbing transmission of COVID-19 [6] . However, these measures have enormous economic, social and mental health impacts and therefore policy-makers must carefully consider the relative costs and benefits of every policy. Unfortunately, neither the costs nor benefits of NPIs for COVID-19 are well understood due the enormous complexity of the problem in terms of both virology and human dynamics. To further complicate matters, governments have been forced to introduce wide ranges of measures at once, from closing borders to restricting people's radius of movement. This has made it di cult to directly study the impacts of any one intervention on transmission rates.",

With the advent of GPS-enabled smartphones, most people around the world today are continuously generating data on their mobility patterns. These data are collected and aggregated in several ways: Telecoms companies routinely record histories of device connections to cell towers for billing purposes, and these data can be used to reconstruct individual device trajectories. There are also companies who collect location data from users through Software Development Kits (SDKs) embedded in a set of partner apps [11, 32] . These data can have finer spatial resolution than those collected by telecoms companies due to the use of GPS. However, since they only collect data from users who use specific apps and opt in to having their location data collected, sample sizes are small and there is potential for demographic self-selection bias.",

            "text": "Numerous studies that use mobile phone data to analyze urban mobility and behaviour have been published over the past several years [20, 21, 31] . In the past year, there have also been several studies using telecoms data to study mobility in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some studies only look at how behaviour has changed and do not incorporate data on COVID-19 infections [7, 9, 24, 32] . Other studies build metapopulation compartmental models, which divide the population into smaller communities and assume that transmission within each community is governed by a model such as random mixing, with reduced transmission between communities [25] . Previously, the mixing of communities in these models has been informed by traditional commuting data but recent studies have used O-D matrices and/or visits to POIs inferred from telecoms data [5, 38] . As discussed in [22] , this approach assumes a known model of the exact social-contact pattern of individuals within each origin, destination and/or POI. The sub-communities should therefore be small enough that contact patterns are uniform, and the model for these contact patterns must be realistic. The most commonly assumed model of contact patterns is mass-action, whereby interactions per person are independent of the density of people. However, other studies assume that infection rates in a location are proportional to density of people [12] . There is also variation across recent studies in the size of the area used as sub-communities. The accuracy of such simulation models depend on a good understanding of the influence of density on transmission within communities.",

The telecoms data were used to develop and analyze metrics that are indicative of people's mobility and behaviors. The mobility and behavioral metrics include the daily number of entrances to the country, the fraction of the population staying home, the number of people making trips between the country's regions (parishes), and measures of crowding. In addition, serology and reported cases data were used to analyze infection rates and the temporal relationship between infection rates and mobility behaviors. Each of the data sources and the computation of metrics are described in the sub-sections below.",

As shown in Figure 2 , during this period and the preceding weeks, the cumulative case count was relatively flat, implying that the number of people with either current or prior infections remained stable during this period. Participants were tested for presence of both IgM and IgG antibodies twice, with two weeks between each round of testing. 91% of the population completed the first round of testing and 86% completed the second round. The test data were annonymised, so that individual-level analysis of risk was not possible. However, the data included additional variables, including parish of residence and residency status, allowing group infection rates to be compared. Livzon IgM/IgG Diagnostic Kits were used [29] . All such screenings are subject to some level of error, both false positives and false negatives. Independent testing of the kits had previously been carried out to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate the actual number of people with current or previous infections, accounting for sensitivity and specificity [35] , as shown in equation 1 below.

To infer home parish, each stay-point first was assigned to the parish in which it was contained. Each subscriber's home parish was then determined to be the parish in which they spent the most cumulative time during night-time hours (12:00am to 6:00am). This method is similar to those employed in related studies of human mobility that use cellular data [15, 26, 32, 33] . To evaluate the representativeness of the telecoms data and this methodology, the distribution of home parishes inferred for subscribers was compared to the projected 2020 population statistics published by the Andorran government [18] . This evaluation used AT data from May, 2020 and was restricted to the subscribers using Andorra as their home network, and that the pre-processing stage categorized as non-tourists. The month of May was used because it was the last month of the lockdown before the country reopened its borders. These data restrictions were made in order to more likely capture the permanent residents of Andorra for a better comparison to the published population statistics. The Pearson correlation coe cient between the parish-level populations inferred from this analysis and the published population statistics is 0.959, suggesting that the telecoms data is highly representative of the true population (see Figure 3 ).",

Indoor crowding involves the additional risk of aerosol transmission even when e\u21b5orts are made to social distance. As a proxy for such crowding, interaction potential was defined as follows. The time period and study region were first divided into discrete spatio-temporal intervals. H3 cells of resolution 11 [1] were used as the geographic intervals. At this resolution, the H3 cells have an approximate diameter of 50m [4] which roughly corresponds to the resolution of the telecoms data in urban areas. Time was divided in 20 minute intervals. In every spatio-temporal interval, the number of potential interactions was counted as the number of unique person pairs in the interval. This is illustrated in Figure 4 . The interactions were further subdivided by the home parishes and/or residence status of the people. Additionally, a distinction was made between indoor interaction potential and outdoor in-teraction potential based on the percentage of indoor and outdoor area in the H3 cell. These percentages were calculated using the Global Human Settlement Layers (GHSL) [16] . The interaction potential metrics can be defined as below: Unique person-to-person interactions per day were also quantified. The daily person-to-person interaction graph, G d was defined as follows. A node was created for every person present in the country that day. A pair of nodes was linked if those two people had been co-located in one or more spatio-temporal intervals during that day. The degree of each node was defined as the number of Daily Contacts of the corresponding person.",

The indoor and outdoor interaction potential in Figure 11 appear to track one another very closely throughout the period of March to mid-September but after mid-September, these apparent trends diverge as indoor interactions increase while outdoor interactions decrease.

On the other hand, if people restrict their mobility behaviours in response to changes in the rate of reported infections, then the infections would lead the mobility metrics by some period. For each metric, it is unknown a priori whether mobility leads infections, infections lead mobility, or both. In order to address this question, the time series data for daily mobility metrics were compared to the daily LCG time series with a range of lag times.

Conversely, there is no evidence that these metrics increase or decrease in response to changes in transmission rate, as there is a small negative correlation between these mobility metrics and transmission rate when mobility metrics lag LCG. Figure 12 (B) shows 3 metrics which exhibit the same correlation trends as (A), but with slightly weaker correlation values. Again, these metrics are positively correlated with transmission with a lead of 2-3 weeks, and also moderately negatively correlated with transmission rate, with a lag of about 2-3 weeks. This suggests that (i) when these mobility behaviours increase, there is a moderate increase in transmission rate 2-3 weeks later and (ii) when the transmission rate increases, there is a moderate decrease in the mobility behaviours 2-3 weeks later. Figure  12 (C) shows that new entrances to the country seem to be highly correlated with infection rate, with a lead of 30 days. However, the correlation remains positive when changes in entrances lag LCG, making the relationship between country entrances and transmission less clear. Lead times greater than 30 days were not explored in this study because relationships between mobility and transmission rate at greater lead times would be less plausible.

In particular, the parish of Canillo accommodated 45% of tourists in February and residents of Canillo had a higher potential for interacting with tourists than residents of any other parish. Despite this, 3 of the 5 other parishes considered had an equal or higher infection rate. These findings suggest that, while tourists likely imported Andorra's initial COVID-19 cases, subsequent geographical mixing quickly spread the infection to less touristic areas, even as the country was in full lockdown.",

Specifically, it was found that mobility metrics related to crowding and trips between parishes were highly correlated with infection rates 2-3 weeks later. Conversely, measures of overall trip making (including intra-parish travel) were only moderately correlated with later infection rates. Furthermore, the phenomenon most highly correlated with subsequent infection rates -interaction potential -was shown to be a fat-tailed phenomenon dominated by a small number of people and events. Finally, some measures of stay-at-home rates and total trip making could be seen to reduce in response to high infection rates, which may have been due to policy responses or to individual volition.",

Furthermore, the events which draw the highest density of crowds should be identified and discouraged. On the other hand, policies which aim to reduce mobility across the board, are likely to be less e\u21b5ective and have higher social and economic costs. For example, between April 19th and May 13th in Andorra, outdoor exercise was restricted to a 1km radius for 1 hour every second day. Such measures would have likely reduced intra-parish outdoor trips while having little impact on the most relevant metrics like inter-parish trips and crowded indoor events.",
