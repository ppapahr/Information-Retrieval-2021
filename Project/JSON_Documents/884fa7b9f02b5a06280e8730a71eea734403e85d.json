JCV commonly establishes asymptomatic, lifelong persistent or latent infection in the general population but, in patients with prolonged and profound compromise of cellular immunity, JCV can reactivate from sites of latency and undergo sequential genomic rearrangements. This intrahost viral evolution allows an otherwise benign virus to cause lytic infection of CNS glial cells and thus PML.",

The family Polyomaviridae has since expanded, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and the spectrum of JC virus-related disease Irene Cortese 1 \u2709 , Daniel S. Reich 2 and Avindra Nath 3 Abstract | Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a devastating CNS infection caused by JC virus (JCV), a polyomavirus that commonly establishes persistent, asymptomatic infection in the general population. Emerging evidence that PML can be ameliorated with novel immunotherapeutic approaches calls for reassessment of PML pathophysiology and clinical course. PML results from JCV reactivation in the setting of impaired cellular immunity, and no antiviral therapies are available, so survival depends on reversal of the underlying immunosuppression. Antiretroviral therapies greatly reduce the risk of HIV-related PML, but many modern treatments for cancers, organ transplantation and chronic inflammatory disease cause immunosuppression that can be difficult to reverse. These treatments -most notably natalizumab for multiple sclerosis -have led to a surge of iatrogenic PML. The spectrum of presentations of JCV-related disease has evolved over time and may challenge current diagnostic criteria. Immunotherapeutic interventions, such as use of checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer, have shown promise but caution is needed in the management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, an exuberant immune response that can contribute to morbidity and death. Many people who survive PML are left with neurological sequelae and some with persistent, low-level viral replication in the CNS. As the number of people who survive PML increases, this lack of viral clearance could create challenges in the subsequent management of some underlying diseases. and 11 additional human viruses of this family have been identified in the past decade 2 . The number and variety of human polyomaviruses reflect their ability to propagate at low levels without causing disease and to evade clearance by the immune system; most polyomaviruses establish asymptomatic infection in healthy hosts and are pathogenic only in the setting of severe immunosuppression 3 .",

These rearrangements are thought to result from sequential, replication-driven homologous recombination events in the setting of viral reactivation, and might be favoured by the presence of palindromic sequences within the JCV genome. Such recombination events might not be uncommon in individuals with immunosuppression even if they do not go on to develop PML, and the vast majority of NCCR rearrangements are likely to generate non-viable sequences. However, in rare cases, rearrangement can give the virus new tissue tropism and pathogenic potential owing to www.nature.com/nrneurol the introduction of tissue-specific response elements and an increase in replicative ability in glial cells 32 . Indeed, sequence analysis of rearranged NCCRs demonstrates that negative transcription control signals are lost and positive transcription control signals are created or duplicated 22, 27 , leading to increases in gene expression and the rate of replication in prototype viruses compared with the gene expression and rate of replication in the archetype strain 31 . Whereas early gene expression and late gene expression in archetype and rearranged viral variants were comparable in renal-derived cell lines (HEK293), late gene expression was suppressed in archetype strains in glioblastoma cell lines. Such differences could contribute to tissue-specific replicative advantages of rearranged variants in vivo 33 .",

For example, mutations in VP1 can affect pathogenesis of PML, and some variants seem to be associated with heightened susceptibility or aggressive disease [51] [52] [53] [54] . Host genetic risk factors have also been identified; for example, individuals with the HLA-DRB1*0401 allele were found to have limited ability to mount robust antiviral responses 55 , and polymorphisms of the tumour suppressor protein p53 -a binding site of large tumour antigen that may modulate viral gene expression -can increase susceptibility 56 . More recently, use of whole-exome sequencing has identified 19 rare germ line PML risk variants that affect 17 genes related to immune function 57 . Determining how these host genetic factors influence susceptibility to PML will be of great interest and could offer opportunities for personalized pharmacovigilance strategies. The most striking risk factors for the development of PML, however, seem to be the particular underlying disease and the immunosuppressive drug used ( fig. 1 ).",

We refer to these presentations as 'inflammatory PML.' At the extreme of this gradient is extensive inflammation that can in itself lead to immune-mediated injury -this presentation is called 'progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome' (PML IRIS).

The first clinical descriptions of PML date back to 1958, when it was described in eight patients with haematological malignancy 68 63 , the first stage of infection, which occurs in most of the general population, is subclinical, persistent infection of the kidney with nonpathogenic archetype JC virus (JCV). Shedding of virus into the urine is probably the major source of environmental contamination (step 1). During this stage, the virus can spread to secondary sites, including the bone marrow, lymphoid tissue and possibly the brain, where latent infection can be established (step 2). The second stage of infection can occur with prolonged impairment of cellular immunity, which allows viral reactivation and accumulation of neuropathogenic JCV variants with rearrangements of the non-coding control region (NCCR) (step 3). The anatomic sites of these mutational events are not known. Leukocytes, including CD34 + progenitor cells, B cell lineage cells and other lymphocyte subsets could be vehicles for haematogenous spread of JCV, either via infection of these cells or via passive transportation of virus on the cell surface (step 4). Neurotropic virus might reach the brain at this stage via transportation by leukocytes or as cellfree virus, although local transformation from latent archetype virus has not been excluded. The third stage is clinically manifest PML (step 5). On immune reconstitution, as a result of either specific treatment for PML or discontinuation of an immunosuppressive therapy, subclinical or clinical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can occur (step 6). Patient survival after successful immune reconstitution suggests a fourth stage in which host-virus equilibrium is re-established and latent or persistent infection with rearranged pathogenic virus is established in the brain (step 7). In some patients, low copy numbers of the virus persist in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The risk of PML recurrence in these patients is unknown but it is not negligible.

At the time of presentation, MRI most commonly reveals multifocal lesions, but repeated MRI can be used to observe asynchronous enlargement and coalescence of lesions and the appearance of new lesions. The typical lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted FLAIR sequences, involves subcortical and juxtacortical white matter, and usually (but not always) appears sharply delineated at the cortical border. Lesions are isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images, but the appearance depends heavily on the type of T1-weighted sequence performed. With increasing focal destruction and tissue necrosis, T1-weighted signal intensity decreases, so the overall appearance is highly heterogenous. If the patient survives, neurodegenerative changes with focal atrophy (including ex vacuo dilatation of CSF spaces) can develop over weeks to months. Imaging features commonly associated with inflammation, such as mass effect, are typically absent in classic PML; however, www.nature.com/nrneurol faint peripheral contrast enhancement was observed in 9% of patients with HIV-related PML in the pre-cART era, even in the absence of pathologically proven focal inflammatory response 82 . At the leading edges of acutely expanding lesions, restricted diffusion is commonly seen, which is thought to result from swelling of dying oligodendrocytes and astrocytes 83 . A band-like paramagnetic shift and T2* signal change at the grey matter-white matter junction has been observed, possibly corresponding to iron deposition, although the reason for this finding is uncertain 84,85 ( fig. 4 ).

Initially, this phenomenon was called 'immune reconstitution syndrome' 88 but it was later renamed 'immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome' (IRIS) 89 . In the context of PML related to HIV infection, IRIS has been defined as immune reconstitution with an increase in CD4 + T cell count or a decrease in plasma levels of HIV RNA, combined with sudden worsening of neurological signs and symptoms. Two presentations of IRIS have been described, on the basis of the timing of the clinical manifestations: paradoxical IRIS, in which symptoms of a previously recognized infection worsen, and unmasked IRIS, in which the inflammatory response against subclinical infection renders it clinically manifest. Estimates suggest that 4-42% of patients with HIV-related PML develop IRIS 84, 86, [90] [91] [92] [93] . Clinical manifestations are usually mild, but if the associated inflammatory response is extensive -which most commonly occurs in patients with the sharpest rise in CD4 + T cell counts -IRIS can be life-threatening; mortality is 5-28% 86,94-96 . In general, the development of inflammatory features in PML is thought to be associated with higher survival rates 96, 97 , although some reports suggest that this is not always the case 92 .",

            "text": "Iatrogenic PML. Iatrogenic PML can present as classic or inflammatory PML, depending on the severity of pharmacological immunosuppression and how readily it can be reversed. The first two descriptions of PML associated with rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets B cells that was approved by the FDA in 1997 (ref. 106 ), were reported in 2002, both in the context of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. With these early cases, however, the relative contribution of any single drug could not be assessed owing to confounding factors, such as previous and ongoing treatments and co-morbidities, that independently increase the risk of PML. However, in 2005, the first alarming reports of PML developing in otherwise immunocompetent patients marked the beginning of a new era of iatrogenic PML. In that year, three patients who had been treated with the \u03b14 integrin monoclonal antibody natalizumab, which had been approved just the year before for treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn disease, developed PML. Cases of PML in patients receiving rituximab for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus followed, and PML in rheumatoid arthritis was first reported in 2008 (ref. 107 ). Now, at least 18 FDA-approved medications carry label warnings for PML 63 . Generally, the risk of PML with these medications is very low, with the exceptions of natalizumab (overall risk of 1 in 1,000) 108 and the CD11a monoclonal antibody efalizumab (estimated overall risk of 1 in 400); the latter has since been withdrawn from the market 109 . Both of these drugs affect lymphocyte trafficking but are not otherwise immunosuppressive, and the risk of PML with both of these drugs is associated with prolonged exposure of more than 2 years. Taken together, these characteristics make these monoclonal antibody therapies substantially different from historically recognized risk factors for PML. Efalizumab was withdrawn from the market in 2009 after four reported cases of PML. Natalizumab was briefly withdrawn in 2005 following the first reports of PML but was reintroduced in 2006 for treatment of multiple sclerosis under a rigorous pharmacovigilance programme (the TOUCH programme, Biogen Idec). Nevertheless, the number of multiple sclerosis-natalizumab-associated cases of PML continues to rise and had reached 836 by August 2020 (information available on request from Biogen Medical Information). Importantly, these numbers include only cases of definite PML. In the post-cART era and among patients with underlying autoimmune disease, the levels of JCV in the CSF are commonly below the limits of assay detection, so unless tissue diagnosis is pursued, these cases do not meet current diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the reported numbers of PML cases are probably underestimations 64,110 . In the initial imaging studies of natalizumabassociated PML, contrast enhancement of lesions was present at first diagnosis in ~40% of patients 111, 112 . This proportion was distinctly different from that in other settings, an observation that might reflect the unique nature of immune dysregulation induced by natalizumab. The enhancement patterns in these patients have been described as linear, punctate or rim-like 113 . A new MRI feature has also been described in natalizumab-associated PML that is present in 72% of patients with this condition: small, perilesional T2 hyperintensities that are often enhanced on administration of contrast material, referred to as a 'Milky Way appearance' . This appearance has been proposed as an indication of an early immune response in perivascular spaces, perhaps related to foci of active JCV replication 114, 115 . Similar MRI findings have since been seen in PML associated with other causes of immune dysregulation, including HIV-related PML 95 .",

However, several factors in combination can identify the patients who are at the greatest risk of PML. These factors include the presence of JCV antibodies, a duration of natalizumab treatment beyond 2 years and prior treatment with immunosuppressive agents. For patients in the highest risk group based on these factors, the estimated incidence is 11.1 cases per 1,000 per year; among patients who are antibody negative and therefore at the lowest risk, the estimated incidence is at most 0.09 cases per 1,000 per year 116 . Empirical evidence that the measurement of JCV antibodies is useful as a screening tool comes from the observation that the incidence of PML among patients who were treated with natalizumab decreased by ~50% within 18 months after introduction of the JCV antibody assay 117 . The JCV antibody index, based on measurement of antibodies to JCV, is now used in clinical practice as a biomarker for further stratification of patients who are treated with natalizumab and who have not previously received immunosuppressive treatment 118 . In addition, emerging evidence suggests that extended interval dosing of natalizumab (more than 4 weeks) may decrease the risk of PML among patients who are positive for JCV antibodies and/or who have received prior immunosuppression 119 .",

Persistent viral infections are associated with progressive development of immune exhaustion, which is characterized by a programmed loss of lymphocyte effector functions. Physiologically, this mechanism limits immune-mediated injury in the context of chronic inflammation, but it can impair viral clearance. Checkpoint inhibitors target pathways that are involved in immune exhaustion and can reinvigorate antiviral immunity. Evidence from a total of 18 patients with refractory immunosuppression suggests that targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) can lead to restoration of anti-JCV activity of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and associated clinical and radiological benefit in some patients 168 . This approach seems to be most promising for individuals in whom some anti-JCV cellular immune response is detectable before treatment: in these patients, reinvigoration of antiviral responses was seen after one or two monthly drug administrations. Conversely, advanced PML and profound immune compromise are associated with poor responses to this therapy 169 . Immune-related adverse events have been well documented in oncological applications of checkpoint inhibitors 170 , and such events are likely to emerge among patients who receive this treatment for PML -some of whom have underlying autoimmunity -if checkpoint inhibition is applied more broadly in this disease.",

However, steroids affect antiviral responses 176 and are, therefore, not recommended for preventive use but should be reserved for instances in which the inflammation itself might compromise the patient's outcome [177] [178] [179] . Alternatively, CCR5 + T cells, which have a prominent role in IRIS, could be directly targeted. On this basis, the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc has been used to selectively limit trafficking of these cells into the CNS, but results have been mixed, so whether this approach will be of benefit is unclear [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] .",

In the early years, following its first description, PML was rare and almost uniformly fatal, seen most commonly in patients with haematological malignancy. During the AIDS pandemic, the incidence of PML increased dramatically -up to 5% of patients with AIDS developed the disease. With the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapies (cART) in 1996, this proportion declined substantially, and immune reconstitution was established as a way to prevent PML and to increase the chance of survival. Although the majority of PML cases worldwide are still associated with AIDS, iatrogenic PML is linked to a growing number of therapies that target immune function. Most notable of these are natalizumab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), rituximab for the treatment of haematological cancers and rheumatological disorders, and efalizumab for the treatment of psoriasis (efalizumab was withdrawn from the market in 2009 after reports of association with PML). JCV, JC virus; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus. MrI findings in various presentations of JC virus infection. a | MRI of a 40-year-old woman with a history of follicular lymphoma who was treated with bendamustine and rituximab and developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while receiving rituximab maintenance therapy. MRI shows progression of PML lesions over a 4-month period. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images show enlargement of lesions in the right frontal and parietal lobes (double-headed arrows). At the final time point (month 4), involvement of the right cerebral hemisphere is nearly complete and involvement of the left frontal and parietal lobes is substantial.",
