In addition, four seasonal human coronaviruses (ie, 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) have been identified as causing up to a third of community-acquired upper respiratory tract infections. Coronaviruses compose a family within the Nidovirales order and replicate by use of a nested set of mRNAs. Although most human coronaviruses have been betacoronaviruses, two of the seasonal viruses (ie, 229E and NL63) are alphacoronaviruses, which shows that both viral subgroups are important human pathogens.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since caused a pandemic involving virtually every country. As of Oct 5, 2020, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 has only had months to accumulate (figure 1). Although researchers understand more about immunity to other human coronaviruses than about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, that knowledge is also sparse. For reasons that are poorly understood, immunity to seasonal human coronaviruses tends to be short in duration, lasting from 80 days to a few years. Reinfections have been documented with three of the four seasonal human coronaviruses (ie, 229E, NL63, and OC43). Reinfection, after documented infection, has been shown in patients with SARS-CoV-2. 1 Whether such reinfection represents non-durable protective immunity, different strains of the same virus, or both, is unclear. 2 In patients infected with either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, detection of humoral markers of immunity were measurable for 2-3 years, but these markers were absent when patients were re-tested 5-6 years later. 3, 4 Understanding the mechanisms for short-duration immunity after a live viral infection is important because these processes might have consid erable implications for the protection and durability of immunity induced by vaccines.",

There is little knowledge of post-infection immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and the biological and genetic factors responsible for the broad spectrum of disease severity remain unclear. Data suggest that uncoordinated or partially neutralising antibodies, and responses from CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, might be associated with COVID-19 severity, with age being a risk factor. 5 Information concerning the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the targets of B-cell and T-cell responses, can assist in the continued development of succeeding generations of new vaccines and therapeutics. We therefore review current knowledge relevant to humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in humans and its application to vaccine development.",

Considerable IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 proteins (eg, nucleocapsid protein, S1, ORF9b, nsp5, and others; figure 3 ) have been detected in convalescent serum samples from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 by use of SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray technology. 9 Functional neutralising antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 that are produced following infection, vaccination, or both (anti-spike glycoprotein and anti-RBD) are considered important for viral neutralisation and viral clearance, and are quantified by use of in vitro neutralisation assays. For these reasons, antibody titres might be good biomarkers for the protective efficacy of antibodies and successful humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. 10 Indeed, a strong correlation (r range 0\u00b787-0\u00b794) between neutralising antibody responses against the spike glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid protein, and RBD proteins detected by the plaque reduction neutralisation test and those detected by ELISAs has been reported in patients with PCRconfirmed COVID-19. 10 IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine-like protease have also been reported in patients with COVID-19, and these responses correlate well with antibody titres to the nucleocapsid protein. 11 High-quality studies that examine the duration of protection by functional neutralising antibodies and the potential for reinfection are needed in large cohorts of patients with COVID-19 to further understand and characterise SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity.",

            "text": "Most patients with COVID-19 or those who are convalescent have virus-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG responses in the days after infection, suggesting that antibodies mediate protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. 12, 13 The overall kinetics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 are analogous to those for SARS-CoV-1, which are characterised by robust seroconversion (IgM and IgG) 7-14 days following symptom onset and antibody concentrations persisting for weeks to months after infection and viral clearance. 14 A longitudinal study assessing the kinetics of spike glycoprotein-specific antibodies in patients with COVID-19 found that IgA antibodies were produced early (in the first week) and peaked in concentration at 20-22 days, whereas IgM antibodies reached high titres at 10-12 days that subsequently waned 18 days after the onset of symptoms. 13 A seroprevalence study that examined IgG responses to spike glycoprotein in 40 patients with COVID-19 after symptom onset reported that IgG titres increased during the first 3 weeks and began to decrease by 8 weeks. 15 In individuals with mild COVID-19, a rapid decline of RBD-specific IgG titres within 2-4 months has been observed in several studies, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-induced humoral immunity might not be long-lasting in individuals with mild disease. 16, 17 Similar results have been reported with antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. 18 A prospective study of 67 patients with COVID-19 who had high titres (peak titre >2 fold the cutoff value for a positive result) of nucleocapsid-specific IgM (up to 1:800) and IgG (up to 1:60) after symptom onset found that antibody titres were significantly higher in patients with severe disease than they were in patients without severe disease and were associated with clinical outcomes. 19 Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 and low IgG titres (ie, peak titre 1-2 fold the cutoff value for a positive result) had a higher rate of viral clearance than did patients with COVID-19 and high IgG titres (ie, strong antibody responders), again suggesting that strong antibody responses might be associated with more severe disease, and low antibody responses might be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. 19 However, a comprehensive study of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which also examined the association with disease severity, showed that the concentration of neutralising antibody was not correlated with COVID-19 severity, indicating that cellular immune responses are also important for resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 A report on the immunological assessment of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 acute infections found that IgG titres were much higher in symptomatic individuals than they were in asymptomatic individuals (median signal-to-cutoff ratio 20\u00b75 [IQR 5\u00b78-38\u00b72] vs 3\u00b74 [1\u00b76-10\u00b77]; p=0\u00b7005) in the 3-4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. 20 In the convalescent phase (ie, 8 weeks after discharge from hospital), IgG titres in symptomatic individuals remained significantly higher than those in asymptomatic individuals (p=0\u00b7002). Notably, IgG titres declined during the convalescent phase in 30 (97%) of the 31 symptomatic individuals and in 28 (93%) of the 30 asymptomatic individuals, with four (13%) symptomatic individuals and 12 (40%) asymptomatic individuals becoming IgG seronegative within 2-3 months following infection. 20 Other COVID-19 studies have reported similar results indicating that antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection have a short duration (eg, 3-4 months). 16, 21 A study from Iceland reported that 1107 (91\u00b71%) of 1215 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR remained seropositive 4 months following diagnosis, with no reduction in antibody titres. 22 Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to further understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-induced anti bodies in populations and the role that these antibodies have in the risk and severity of COVID-19. Such knowl edge is relevant to diagnosing patients with COVID-19 early and for examining the incidence of infections (clinical and subclinical) in different populations.",

In a cohort of 20 patients with COVID-19, S1-specific IgG responses were significantly higher in older women (>40 years) than in younger women (<40 years) and men, implying that older women might develop antibody responses more effectively than do other groups. 9 In 149 convalescent individuals, however, men had significantly higher anti-RBD and anti-spike glycoprotein neutralising IgG titres than did women. 23 Sex-specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been found in the Icelandic population, 22 and a small study has shown sex-specific differences in innate, antibody, and T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 24 With regards to age, older (60-85 years) and middle-aged (40-59 years) patients had significantly higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies than did younger patients (15-39 years) . 25 Two studies have identified inborn genetic mutations that disrupt type I interferon responses 26 and the genetically driven production of autoantibodies blocking type I interferon function 27 as risk factors for severe COVID-19. These findings suggest that this innate immune response has an important role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a potential explanation for the wide variety of clinical disease phenotypes.",

            "text": "Grifoni and colleagues 33 used HLA prediction algorithms and peptide megapools to identify SARS-CoV-2specific T cells in ten patients with COVID-19 and 11 healthy, unexposed control participants. Virus-specific CD4 + T-cell responses were detected in seven (70%) patients with COVID-19 and virus-specific CD8 + T-cell responses were detected in all ten patients with COVID-19, further indicating that most individuals can develop T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Recognition of SARS-CoV-2 antigens by pre-existing and cross-reactive T cells created during previous infection with human coronaviruses might also contribute to the frequent presence of T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. The CD4 + T-cell response predominantly consisted of T-helper-1 (Th1) cells, characterised by high concentrations of IFN\u03b3 secretion and a propensity for the structural spike glycoprotein, the membrane protein, and the nucleocapsid protein (in that order), although non-structural proteins (ie, nsp3, nsp4, and ORF8) were also targeted. CD8 + T-cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 produced IFN\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, also reflective of a response skewed towards Th1 cells. The immunodominance pattern differed from the Th cell response, but the pattern also showed a preference for structural proteins over non-structural proteins (in order of preference: spike glycoprotein, membrane protein, nsp6, nucleocapsid, ORF8, and ORF3a; figure 3 ). Unexposed donors also had CD4 + T cells (six [60%] of ten) and CD8 + T cells (four [36%] of 11) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, suggesting that T-cell cross-reactivity might be common. Peng and colleagues 36 evaluated T-cell responses in 42 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 19 unexposed controls using an overlapping peptide pool strategy covering each viral protein, except for ORF1. Peng and colleagues 36 also noted that both the CD4 + T-cell and the CD8 + T-cell responses were mainly skewed towards Th1 cells, with the production of IFN\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1, and found that the spike glycoprotein was immunodominant. In both studies, the strength and breadth of the immune response was increased in patients with severe disease compared with patients with mild disease, and there was considerable inter-individual variability in the response; however, a few peptides were more commonly targeted than were others. A more in-depth evaluation of T-cell responses in 203 patients with COVID-19 found that virus-specific T cells displayed an activated, cytotoxic phenotype during acute infection, whereas virus-specific T cells evaluated during the convalescent phase had a memory phenotype and were polyfunctional, with both CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells expressing IFN\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1. 37 Notably, T-cell responses were detectable in individuals recovering from mild COVID-19 who did not have detectable antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. 37 In the first report of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (an adenovirus serotype-5-vectored vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein) in humans, T-cell responses in the 108 vaccine recipients were measured by an IFN\u03b3 enzymelinked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation with overlapping spike glycoprotein peptides. 38 T-cell responses from CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells were detectable 14 and 28 days after vaccination. The responding T cells also produced IL-2, TNF\u03b1, or both. CD4 + T cells were more likely to be polyfunctional than were CD8 + T cells. Pre-vaccination T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were minimal or nonexistent in all patients, suggesting that this population did not have cross-reactive T-cell immunity. The extent of cross-reactivity between T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 remains to be seen.",

However, a singlecell RNA sequencing study of the CD4 + T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 found an increased proportion of Tfh cells in patients with severe disease compared with patients with mild disease. 41 The authors reported that cell clusters enriched in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells expressed canonical Tfh genes (eg, CXCL13, IL21, and BTLA), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection does lead to the production of Tfh cells. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 are also associated with increased numbers of T-helper-17 (Th17) cells, 42 and there is evidence that Th17 cells accumulating in the lungs can contribute to the excessive inflammation seen in COVID-19. 43, 44 Several early reports have found a statistically significant reduction in T-cell counts in patients with COVID-19, 45, 46 with additional studies reporting functional exhaustion of the remaining T cells.

            "text": "A report by Laing and colleagues 50 sought to identify an immune signature in patients with COVID-19 that could be used to guide clinical care and treatment. In addition to the development of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses specific to SARS-CoV-2, the authors found several additional characteristics that could distinguish between patients with COVID-19 and patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and non-exposed patient controls. These characteristics in patients with COVID-19 included the upregulation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10; rapidly cycling T cells expressing exhaustion markers (PD-1 and HAVcr-2); depletion of both \u03b1\u03b2T cells and \u03b3\u03b4T cells; decreases in natural effector and CD5 + B cells; increased neutrophil numbers; and a shift in the frequency of CD11 + versus CD11myeloid dendritic cells. Further examination of these alterations might provide insight into disease presentation. Targeted therapies to reverse or minimise these changes (eg, suppression of inflammatory cytokine production) could also provide clinical benefit.",

            "text": "Overall, the current data show that both CD4 + T-cell and CD8 + T-cell responses occur in most patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 within 1-2 weeks after symptom onset and produce mainly Th1 cytokines. The frequency of CD4 + T cells targeted to the spike glycoprotein correlates with neutralising antibody titres, 33 suggesting that the T-cell response might also vary among individuals with different disease severities. Two small studies 37, 51 have also suggested that some individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 develop specific T-cell memory responses in the absence of specific antibodies, indicating that cellular immunity might be induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of humoral immune responses. The contribution of cellular immunity to protection against COVID-19 is not currently clear; however, a balanced immune response consisting of high titres of neutralising antibodies and Th1-biased T cells will probably be optimal. The role of CD8 + T-cell responses in protection against COVID-19 is also unclear, with some evidence suggesting that CD8 + T-cell responses are stronger in patients with mild disease than in patients with severe disease. 36, 37 Additional research into the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Some, but not all, of the phase 1/2 trials of COVID-19 vaccines examined cellular immunity; therefore, this hypothesis cannot be fully answered.",

            "text": "Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that elicit protective immune responses are crucial to the prevention and mitigation of the morbidity and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current understanding suggests that a balanced humoral and Th1-directed cellular immune response might be important for protection from COVID-19 and the avoidance of vaccine-enhanced disease. 52 Various candidate vaccines are being developed and tested, including nucleic acid vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein or peptide subunit vaccines, and viral-vectored vaccines (table) . Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, which have been reviewed elsewhere. [53] [54] [55] The front runner candidates are all administered by the intramuscular route; therefore, focus is on evaluating immune responses in the blood rather than those in the mucosal surfaces. The role of mucosal immunity should not be discounted, and several intranasal vaccine formulations are under investigation. [56] [57] [58] By August, 2020, multiple phase 3 clinical vaccine trials, each involving tens of thousands of participants, had commenced in various geographical locations (eg, the USA, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, China, and South Africa). Interim results from these trials are expected to be available at the end of 2020 and will provide a first indication of the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Notably, some phase 3 trials are designed and statistically powered around the primary outcome of preventing severe COVID-19. This design could be problematic in terms of sufficient numbers of participants. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance stating that a COVID-19 vaccine would have to protect at least 50% of vaccinated people to be considered efficacious. 59 In addition, establishing safety will be limited in statistical power in most trials, particularly for uncommon adverse events. Notably, few trials include people younger than 18 years and are likely to enrol sufficiently large numbers of people older than 55 years (particularly those in congregate living situations), and all trials currently exclude women who are pregnant. Many mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified; 60 therefore, vaccine development could be obstructed if the virus later evades immunity to the spike glycoprotein used to construct the vaccine-the so-called Achilles heel of COVID-19 vaccines. 61 We now review the vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 trials.",

Humoral immune outcomes in vaccine recipients were similar to those observed in convalescent plasma from patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Adverse events (eg, pain and tenderness at the injection site, chills, fatigue, fever, headache, malaise, muscle aches, and nausea) were mostly mild and largely occurred within 4-5 days of vaccination. The trial protocol was amended to include the prophylactic use of paracetamol, which reduced local and systemic reactions to the vaccine. The phase 1/2 trial was briefly paused after a participant developed neurological symptoms, which were later linked to multiple sclerosis. A large phase 3 trial of the AZD1222 vaccine involving 30 000 adults (20 000 vaccine recipients and 10 000 controls) began in August, 2020, in multiple worldwide locations (table). The phase 3 trial was paused after a vaccine recipient developed symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis. Although the UK trial resumed shortly after the pause, as of Oct 5, 2020, the US trial has not yet resumed. This vaccine requires refrigeration, which could be problematic for use in lowincome countries.",

Early results from phase 1/2 trials 66 testing two vaccines (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) in 45 participants indicate that BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine, elicited RBD-binding IgG and neutralising antibodies, with mostly mild side-effects (eg, injection site pain, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain). The participants, aged 18-55 years, were randomly assigned to receive two intramuscular doses, separated by 21 days, of either 10 \u00b5g, 30 \u00b5g, or 100 \u00b5g of BNT162b1 (given as 0\u00b75 mL doses and stored at -80\u00b0C). A second dose of 100 \u00b5g of the vaccine was not administered due to increased reactogenicity. At day 21 after the first vaccine dose, geometric mean titres of RBD-specific IgG were measurable, ranging from 534 U/mL to 1778 U/mL, and were similar to, or more than, those observed in a human convalescent serum panel. By 2 weeks after the second dose, geometric mean titres of neutralising antibody were 1\u00b79 times higher after the 10 \u00b5g vaccine dose and 4\u00b76 times higher after the 30 \u00b5g vaccine dose than the geometric mean titres of neutralising antibody of the convalescent panel, suggesting the presence of antibody affinity maturation. 66 Safety, and cellular and humoral immune responses, 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine were assessed in this trial. BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2 geometric mean titres of neutralising antibody in both younger (18-55 years) and older (65-85 years) participants; however, BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals had higher CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses against the spike glycoprotein and RBD than did the BNT162b1-vaccinated participants. Because BNT162b2 produced a higher breadth of T-cell responses and had a favourable safety profile, BNT162b2 was the candidate vaccine selected for evaluation in phase 3 trials. BNT162b2 requires storage at -80\u00b0C, a fact that could pose logistical problems. A phase 3 trial of approximately 44 000 individuals (aged 18-85 years) is now taking place in the USA (table) .",

In each study, patients were given either a single dose of the rAd5-S vaccine in phase 1, a single dose of the rAd26-S vaccine in phase 1, or both rAD5-S and rAd26-S in phase 2. The first study examined frozen vaccine formulations (0\u00b75 mL per dose; stored at -18\u00b0C), and the second study examined lyophilised formulations (1\u00b70 mL per dose; stored at 2-8\u00b0C). Local and systemic reactions were mild, and 100% of recipients in both studies seroconverted, with RBD ELISA titres and neutralising antibody titres equal to or more than titres observed in convalescent plasma from patients who had recovered from COVID-19. CD4 + and CD8 + Th cell immune responses were detected in all volunteers and peaked at day 28 after vaccination. The Institute of Biology at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences announced the approval (in small population groups) of their adenovirusvectored vaccine (Sputnik V; formerly known as Gam-COVID-Vac) on Aug 12, 2020, before the phase 3 clinical studies had started. A phase 3 safety and efficacy trial will recruit 40 000 participants from different age and risk groups. Concerns have been raised about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, given that the vaccine has not yet been tested in a phase 3 clinical trial. 70 Because of these concerns, verifying the integrity of data (including safety and efficacy data) generated in these clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines is important. 70",

            "text": "Antibody response is an important component of protective immunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 75, 76 In antibody-dependent enhancement, heterotypic (nonneutralising) antibodies might have the potential to facilitate viral entry into cells through interactions with Fc receptors or complement. Even in the absence of active viral replication in immune cells, this process might lead to the activation of macrophages, monocytes, and B cells, and IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-10 production. 77 Cases of antibodydependent enhancement induced by vaccines have been reported after the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and measles, and after the use of a vaccine against dengue virus. [78] [79] [80] Concerns have therefore been raised regarding the potential for antibody-dependent enhance ment in individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination with a COVID-19 candidate vaccine. 38 The potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement mediated by Fc receptors could be increased with mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which could weaken the primary host antibody response. Monocyte, macrophage, and B-cell infection might occur in numerous tissues as a result of subsequently unstable virus-antibody complexes, leading to extensive apoptosis of immune cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines. 52 There was evidence of vaccine-enhanced disease after SARS-CoV-1 vaccine administration in subsequently challenged animal models. 81 Yang and colleagues 82 hypothesised that the molecular mechanism of enhancement might involve the interaction of anti bodies with conformational epitopes in the ACE2-binding domain. A study of antibody-dependent infection of human macrophages by SARS-CoV-1 has shown the role of anti-spike glycoprotein IgG in the infection of immune cells and that antibodydependent enhancement is triggered by downstream signalling pathways of Fc\u03b3RII receptors. [83] [84] [85] Although previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure could have a role in antibody-dependent enhancement, candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines admin istered to small animals and non-human primates produced antibody-mediated protection with no signs of acute lung injury and immunopathology, as was seen after SARS-CoV-1 vaccination in animal models. 75, 86 Antibody-dependent enhancement poses a theoretical obstacle to vaccine development and is being carefully evaluated. 52, 87 The extent to which pre-existing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (and potentially to SARS-CoV-1) might contribute to antibody-dependent enhancement and disease severity remains in question; 81 however, no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement has been found in animal models or in humans in phase 3 clinical trials.",

            "text": "Much remains to be learned regarding coronavirus immunity in general and SARS-CoV-2 immunity in particular, including the protective immunity induced by vaccines and the maintenance of immunity against this virus. Furthermore, multiple vaccine types will probably be needed across different populations (eg, immuneimmature infants, children, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and immunosenescent ind i vi duals aged \u226565 years). In addition to the adaptive immune response, there are some data suggesting that trained innate immunity might also have a role in protection against COVID-19. 88, 89 Multiple clinical trials (eg, NCT04327206, NCT04328441, NCT04414267, and NCT04417335) are examining whether unrelated vac cines, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, can elicit trained innate immunity and confer protection against COVID-19. It is crucial that research focuses on understanding the genetic drivers of infection and vaccineinduced humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2, defining detailed targets of humoral and cellular immune responses at the epitope level, characterising the B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor repertoire elicited by infection or vaccination, and establishing the long-term durability, and maintenance, of protective immunity after infection or vaccination. A safe regulatory pathway leading to licensing must also be defined for use of these vaccines in children, pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and nursing home residents. Some have called for further shortening of the vaccine development process through the use of controlled human challenge models. 90 As of Oct 5, 2020, no such studies have occurred, but the UK is considering initiating such trials in early 2021.",

(1) Attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 virion to the cell surface via interactions with the ACE2 cellular receptor. (2) Entry into the cell. Viral proteins can be recognised by pattern recognition receptors (eg, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7), leading to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns, the inflammatory response, and the activation of innate anti-viral pathways. (3) Membrane fusion and release of RNA into the cell. (4) RNA translation to produce viral proteins. (5) RNA genome is copied and attached to the nucleocapsid protein. (6) Assembly of daughter SARS-CoV-2 virions. (7) Recognition of the spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein (structural proteins) by the B-cell receptor. (8) B cell produces spike glycoprotein-binding antibodies and neutralising antibodies targeting the RBD region of the spike glycoprotein. (9) Viral uptake by APCs. (10) Presentation of antigens, including epitopes from structural and non-structural proteins, to T cells. (11) Activation of Th cells. (12) Activation of CTLs. (13) Th cells produce cytokines (mainly IFN\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF\u03b1). (14) CTL recognition and killing of infected cells. ACE2=angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. APC=antigen-presenting cell.

A phase 3 trial has been launched in Brazil and Indonesia, with the trial in Brazil aiming to enrol 9000 health-care personnel.Sinopharm have developed and are testing two inactivated whole-virus, alum-adjuvanted vaccines. The first vaccine candidate (New Crown COVID-19) was developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. Both phase 1 and 2 study data have been published.74 The phase 1 trial (n=96) examined a three-dose series, and the phase 2 trial (n=224) studied a 5 \u00b5g dose across two study groups: vaccination on day 0 and day 14 (n=84) versus alum only (n=28), or vaccination on day 0 and day 21 (n=84) versus alum only (n=28). This trial included adults aged 18-59 years. The phase 2 trial did not include any comparator, such as convalescent human plasma, but did measure neutralising antibody titres, which were generally similar in concentration to those produced by other COVID-19 vaccines and were higher in the group vaccinated on days 0 and 21 (geometric mean titre 247, 95% CI 176-345) than in the group vaccinated on days 0 and 14 (121, 95-154). In addition, lymphocyte cell subsets and cytokines were measured by flow cytometry and did not show changes across study groups, suggesting that cellular immune responses might not have been generated. The safety profile of this vaccine was excellent, with local and systemic reactions generally on par with those in the alum-only group of the study. A phase 1/2 clinical trial of individuals 6 years and older has also been initiated. A phase 3 clinical trial began in July, 2020, and plans to enrol 21 000 participants in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Peru, Morocco, Argentina, and Jordan. In late August, 2020, Sinopharm researchers revealed that they had already begun to administer the vaccine to health-care personnel and groups at high risk of becoming infected.The second vaccine candidate being tested by Sinopharm was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. A phase 3 trial (n=5000) is taking place in the United Arab Emirates(table). The United Arab Emirates has granted emergency use of the vaccine in health-care providers. Sinopharm have reportedly administered these experimental vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use condition approved by the Chinese Government.72",
