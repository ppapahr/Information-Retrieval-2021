The main interest of this work is to attest, through a statistical approach, how the hysteresis phenomenon, which describes a type of memory effect present in biological systems, can be treated by fractional calculus. We also analyse the contribution of the historical values of a function in the evaluation of fractional operators according to their order. To illustrate the efficiency of this non-integer order calculus, we consider the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) compartmental model which is widely used in epidemiology. We employ this compartmental model to study the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, one version with memory and one without memory.",

            "text": "This calculus is one of the most effective current mathematical tools used to model realworld problems. Several definitions have been proposed for fractional integrals, for example, the fractional integrals of Liouville, Weyl and Riemann-Liouville. The fractional derivative also has several definitions such as those derived from Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, Liouville, Weyl, Riesz, Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov, Marchaud and Hifler (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Saad et al. 2018) . In contrast to the Caputo's fractional derivative, most fractional derivative definitions do not satisfy the property that the derivative of a constant is null. This suggests a preference for the Caputo derivative in many situations. Other definitions that are also commonly used today are of Riemann-Liouville and Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Pinto and Tenreiro Machado 2014) . This is important because the past is considered to explain the present (Camargo and Oliveira 2015; Pinto and Tenreiro Machado 2014) . In Saeedian (2017) , El-Saka (2013), a system of fractional differential equations is used to study the effect of memory on epidemic evolution. One type of memory widely observed in ecology and epidemiology is hysteresis. In hysteresis, the current state of the system depends not only on current conditions but also on previous conditions, that is, past events influence the current dynamics (Beisner et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2017; Pimenov 2012; Yamana et al. 2017) . In Pimenov (2012) , the hysteresis effect is incorporated into the biological model since the defense mechanism of certain living beings is activated. For example, in a situation of spreading of an infectious disease for human beings, depending on type of disease, previous experiences can reveal that social distance or additional hygiene habits are defensive behaviors to prevent its propagation. The vaccine can also have a long-term memory effect, when it has a lasting effect, causing the body to defend itself through immune memory.",

(2017) , in this manuscript, we consider the effect of hysteresis on the spread of the disease through the influence of all previous states in the current states of the dynamics. To illustrate the potential of fractional differential equations in epidemiological processes with hysteresis, we investigate the evolution of COVID-19 in a population. Since the spread of COVID-19 occurs through contact between infected individuals and susceptible individuals, with part of the population already recovered, we employ the famous epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, which is compartmental model proposed by Kermack and McKrendick in 1927 and is mathematically described by a system of first order differential equations (Edelstein-Keshet 1988) . However, due to the fact that this disease is little known and under-reported, parameters such as speed of propagation and recovery and contact rates are difficult to estimate. Consequently, its modeling using classical differential equations can be inappropriate to represent the dynamics of the populations involved. This is still another justification for adopting fractional equations since it is possible to adjust the order of the differential equation to the real data of the spread of the disease.",

Finally, Sect. 5 presents the fractional epidemiological SIR model to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in several countries.

Thus, given an initial value, the solution is uniquely determined for any point of domain. In general, this assertion is not true for fractional differential equations.

Several authors have incorporated effect of hysteresis on biological systems (Beisner et al. 2008; Pimenov 2012; El-Saka 2013; Yamana et al. 2017) . In general, hysteresis is a type of non-limited window memory (that is, limited from the origin), so it can be formulated mathematically with a convolution kernel from the origin. This is a typical kernel used to define integral and differential fractional operators, such as the Caputo derivative. It is also possible to notice from formulas (1) and (4) that the kernel involved reveals that the memory of more recent times has more influence than the memory of previous times. This is in agreement with the evolutionary epidemiological systems (Saeedian 2017) . Our study goes further. It reveals that fractional operators can be interpreted from the statistical approach, through mathematical expectation, where the past history of the system follows a beta distribution. Since the parameter \u03b1 is between 0 and 1, recent times have more influence than previous times in this distribution. The hysteresis effect interpreted by fractional operators is shown in formulas (11)-(13). More specifically, the variation rate in the Caputo derivative is explicitly given by the weighted average of all past derivatives as we can see in the formula (11). The other operators have similar explanations.",

Additionally, we found out in the previous section that fractional calculus is capable of describing the hysteresis effect, which is more specific than the memory effect, since it involves the complete historical past to determine the present situation.

First, we define a range of values where the parameters vary and the software tests all possible combinations for the triple (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b1). For each value (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b1) the software finds a numerical solution I and then calculates the error using (21). Thus, it is possible to find the values (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b1) that provide the solution I with the smallest possible error, as it is desired in the data adjustment process. After having done it, we have the solution I that best fits the number of case data for each country studied in this paper. Thus, we can plot the numerical solution curve for future days, making projections of new cases of COVID-19 in that country, as in Figs We consider the values of S, I and R in the range [0, 1]. For the normalization process, the values of the vector obs must be divided by a value N corresponding to the population of the country. We found in our tests that the total population of the country is not a feasible value for N . This is due to the fact that the peak of the obtained solution is much higher than the peak of the data, resulting in an inadequate adjustment for both models. We observe that lower values for N resulted in a good fit of the models.

Figure 8 suggests that each plateau (i.e. stabilization at a low level of infected individuals) occurs between the first and second waves. Therefore, in this case, the plateau occurs when the proportion of susceptible individuals is around S 2 . t are, respectively, proportional to average of f (s) of the function and its classical derivative f (s), for all instants s between zero and t. So, in fact, the fractional calculus is an appropriate methodology to treat dynamical systems with memory. From this approach we also proved the loss of the memory effect when \u03b1 = 1 in (11)-(13), that is, when we return to the classic case. Moreover, since memory effect can involve the entire history before the present instant, that is, it considers all times s from 0 to t, fractional calculus can be viewed as a suitable tool for modeling of phenomenon with hysteresis. The hysteresis phenomenon can be seen in several dynamic systems, such as physical or biological systems, for which important properties depend on its entire past history.",
