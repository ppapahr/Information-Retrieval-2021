In fact, almost all the known strategies adopted by cancer for immune escape are also used for maintaining systemic homeostasis. So, the more non-specific immune responses being activated, the higher risk for adverse events, which may lead to less potential of therapeutic success.",

Thus blocking PD-L1/PD-1 avoids systemic overreactions and prevents severe damage to normal tissues, but selectively normalize and reset the immunity in tumor microenvironment. 3 However, PD-L1/PD-1 is only responsible for a partial of dysfunctional immunity in human solid tumors. 4 Therefore, identifying new normalizers will increase the spectrum of normalization cancer immunotherapy.",

Briefly, complementary DNA plasmids coding individual human transmembrane proteins were transfected into an artificial aAPC (293 T cell line that expressed a membrane-associated anti-human CD3 (OKT3) singlechain variable fragment (scFv) and several transmembrane signaling adaptor genes), and co-cultured with Jurkat-NF-\u03baB-GFP or Jurkat-NFAT-GFP cell lines. Thus, transfection of T cell activity stimulators will show enhanced the GFP fluorescence intensity while those inhibitors show decrease intensity in comparison to those transfected with mock. This array system covers 90% of human transmembrane proteins (>6500 genes) and can be carried on 1536-well plates. After a few round of screening and validation, siglec-15 was identified as one of the inhibitory candidates.",

Indeed, the authors demonstrate that Siglect-15 is a macrophage-associated T cell immunosuppressive molecule. The mRNA of Siglec-15 is very low in steady-state normal human tissues and most immune cell types, but is ready detectable in macrophages. Similarly, mouse Siglec-15 mRNA is also not detectable in normal tissues, only detectable in BMDMs, but not BMDCs, even upon LPS stimulations. The expression pattern is further validated with specific mAbs against Siglec-15 using flow cytometry, and this protein is only detected on CD11b+ macrophages. In contrast to PD-L1 expression, Siglec-15 expression is inhibited by IFN-\u03b3 in vitro. Using both human and mouse Siglec-15 fusion proteins (hS15-hIg and mS15-mIg), the authors further determine a role of Siglec-15 in suppression of T cell activity in vitro using a various assays in both human and mice. More importantly, using OT-1 mice and Siglec-15 KO mice, they elegantly show a suppressive role of Siglec-15 on antigenspecific T cell response in vivo, which is dependent on IL-10. What worth noting was that Siglec-15-KO mice did not develop obvious physical abnormalities, which consistent with rarely expression on normal tissues and suggested minimal adverse effects for Siglec-15 blockade therapy.",

Moreover, the expression of Siglec-15 was also abundant on tumor infiltrated macrophages. Interestingly, the expression of Siglec-15 was mutually exclusive to PD-L (B7-H1) in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which may partially due to distinct responses to IFN-\u03b3. More importantly, whole-body knockout or macrophages specific knockout of Siglec-15 in mice improved T cells mediated anti-tumor immunity and delayed tumor growth. Finally, anti-Siglec-15 mAbs also blocked the inhibitory effects of Siglec-15 on T cell activities and suppressed the growth of established tumors in mice.

Siglec-15 is minimally expressed on normal tissues at steadystate. However, the expression of Siglec-15 is redundant in a broad spectrum of human cancers and tumor associated myeloid cells. Interestingly, Siglec-15 is mutually exclusive to B7-H1 in human non-small cell lung cancer, which may partially due to its induction by M-GSF and suppression by IFN-\u03b3. Siglec-15 engages with a putative responder protein expressed on effector cells such as CD8 T cells, which induces subsequent suppression of anti-tumor immune responses.
