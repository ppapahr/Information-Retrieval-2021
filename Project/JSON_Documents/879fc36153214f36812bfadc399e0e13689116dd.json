All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19.",

It is known from previous epidemics of SARS and Ebola-virus and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that these conditions can lead to detrimental mental health outcomes such as post-traumatic, depressive and anxiety symptoms in HCW [3, 4] . In a systematic review about the prevalence of mental symptoms among HCW in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic, a pooled prevalence of 23.2% for anxiety, 22 .8% for depression, and 38.9% for insomnia were reported [5] . A meta-analysis that included 62 studies from 17 countries (10 from Europe) found only slightly higher prevalence of anxiety (26%) and depression (25%) among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic [6] .",

In another study conducted in Germany with HCW in the beginning of the pandemic [14] , lower depression scores were observed than those reported in the current study.

The elevated symptom burden of MTA may also be explained by their lower hierarchical position at work or/and by their lower socioeconomic status in comparison with physicians. There is strong empirical evidence demonstrating that depression is associated with socioeconomic position [24, 25] . Lower occupational position has also been shown to be related to a higher risk of depression as compared to higher occupational position [26] .

HCW demonstrated increased levels of depression and anxiety in comparison with the normal population in Germany before the pandemic. During the pandemic HCW revealed a lower burden of mental distress compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrated psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated. Our study suggested that MTA seem to be the most vulnerable group. This result underlines the importance of investigating and supporting not only the mental health of HCW in the frontline but also indispensable professionals in the background. The risk factors revealed in the present study need to be investigated and replicated in further studies. Nevertheless, on the basis of the results uncovered here, the following recommendations can be formulated (Tab. 8): special screening and programs are required to prevent substance abuse in medical staff. Targeted training to perceive and regulate distress levels should be offered to HCW. Concerning insufficient recovery implementation of regular screening of recovery and distress (e.g. via distress thermometer) as well as psychoeducation are recommended. A well-functioning team in which trust prevails can more sufficiently master the challenge in the pandemic situation. Thus, interventions that strengthen the team spirit should be established in daily work. The fear of becoming infected can best be diminished by transparent hygiene measures. The challenges encountered by HCW can also have productive results, leading to meaningful changes in the health care system.",
