Study design NICU providers were invited to join ECMO rounds by teleconference. Data were collected on telerounding participation and ECMO concepts discussed. A survey was sent to all providers. Results From March 2018 to February 2020, telerounding on 24 neonatal ECMO patients (168 ECMO days) was performed in a Level IV NICU. A mean of four providers joined telerounds per ECMO day with an increase from 3 to 6 providers over the study period. Nearly all respondents felt telerounding lowered barriers to attending ECMO rounds (94%), promoted engagement (89%), and improved continuity of care (78%). Barriers to ECMO telerounding were suboptimal audio connections and limited ability to participate in the clinical discussion. Conclusion ECMO telerounding is well-received by NICU providers. It can improve provider participation, complement existing in-person ECMO rounds, and ECMO education.",

Nearly all participants felt teleconferencing lowered barriers to attend ECMO rounds (17, 94%), gave the option to be engaged (16, 89%), felt their continuity of care for the patients on ECMO was improved (14, 78%). The top barriers to utilizing ECMO teleconferencing were suboptimal sound environment due to inability to hear conversations well and loud ambient noise levels (12, 66%) Fig. 1 Remote participant distribution by role. Fig. 2 Average number of remote participants per ECMO run day. and the inability to participate more actively in discussion (6, 33%). Examples of topics discussed on ECMO rounds included anticoagulation management, fluid and nutrition balance, diuretic use and continuous renal replacement therapy, plasmapheresis, ventilator and lung recruitment strategies, troubleshooting cannula position, surgical timing for repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, medication titration of sedation, choice of antibiotics and vasoactive drugs, utility of ancillary radiographic studies such as neuroimaging, abdominal and renal ultrasound, doppler vascular imaging and echocardiography, and timing of trialing off ECMO. Additionally, common ECMO pump related issues such as the circuit cutting-out, arterial and venous limb/cannula thrombosis, bleeding, and oxygenator failure were addressed.",

            "text": "Telerounding increased provider participation and provided continuity of care within our health system. Many physician practices provide clinical coverage to several hospital facilities or clinics and coverage schedules may not always support the continuity of patient care. In our division, neonatologists and advanced practice providers cover nine NICUs and receive neonatal ECMO transports from the Pacific Northwest region, a geographic area that encompasses one-quarter of the U.S. landmass. ECMO telerounds allows the providers within our division who may have cared for the patient prior to transfer to the Level IV unit to participate in ongoing clinical discussions, improving the continuity of care, and decreasing barriers for providers to participate in the care of these critical patients. Nearly all survey respondents agreed that teleconferencing ECMO rounds decreased barriers for participation. This finding is similar to that of the Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) Colorado initiative which focused on developing a statewide network to engage specialists, primary care providers, and other organizations to impart specialty care knowledge and skills for caring for those with complex health conditions in a coordinated statewide approach. The ECHO Colorado initiative utilized the Zoom video communications platform to foster a collaborative education model for healthcare workers in Colorado. On a survey assessing participant engagement, many participants found that the Zoom platform aided in attending sessions due to the flexibility to join from a location of the participant's choice, thus eliminating the geographical barrier to participation [19] . Teleconferencing software has been deployed in many institutions to support physical distancing due to the COVID-19 emergency response and is emerging as an alternative medium for clinical care and education [20, 21] . ECMO telerounding fosters social distancing while maximizing provider participation and the continuity of patient care in the era of COVID-19.",

Our neonatal fellows rotate between the level III delivery center and our level IV NICU, so exposure to ECMO care is variable during a 3-year fellowship. Given the geographic separation of our units and the infrequency of ECMO runs, telerounding supports clinical participation and ECMO education for our neonatal fellows. The use of teleconferencing in promoting attendance at educational sessions is reflected in other fields such as surgery, in which one study utilized teleconferencing for weekly morbidity and mortality conference with a notable increase in surgical faculty participation [22] . When considering ECMO education, it is imperative to incorporate educational strategies that appeal to adult learning styles, targeting cognitive, technical, and behavioral skills through active learning including discussion, simulation, and real-life patient experiences [23] . Participation in teleconferencing for medical education will likely continue to increase as millennial providers prefer educational instruction that is convenient, technologically enhanced, interactive, and relevant to their field [24] .",

The biggest barrier to participation was poor audio quality due to loud ambient sounds such as patient alarms and the inability to hear conversations due to distance from the conference speaker. Care should be taken to configure the speaker closely to the person speaking in the unit to try to minimize audio interference that can take away from the learning environment [25] . One method found to improve sound was to place the Bluetooth conference speaker on a rolling cart in the middle of the rounding team, allowing it to be easy moved closer to the team member speaking. Additionally, by using Zoom's computer audio, or Voice over Internet Protocol on one's computer or iPad, background ambient noise may be more easily suppressed, thus enhancing the audio quality of the teleconferencing experience [26] . The second most frequent barrier to participation was the inability to actively participate in the discussion during telerounds. All ECMO related questions were asked by telerounding participants via the HIPAA compliant teleconferencing software chat box and were answered by the ECMO attending physician. Every effort was made to address these questions in a timely fashion, and actively during the discussion. Adding video connection during telerounds may further enhance participants feelings of active engagement by allowing remote participants to ask questions face-to-face with the medical team [19] .",

First, this study was conducted in a single center Level IV NICU with a division that is accustomed to utilizing telecommunication platforms for meetings and consults. As such, the feasibility and success of teleconferencing ECMO rounds may be difficult to generalize to other NICUs. Second, the survey response rate from participants was 62%, with relatively few fellows and advanced practice providers responding which may skew the data regarding ECMO experience and comfort level. Additionally, the survey was subject to recall bias as providers may have participated remotely months before it was administered. Furthermore, a provider's perception and opinions may have changed since the survey was administered owing to the advancement of the program. Third, this study was conducted to determine the feasibility of teleconferencing for ECMO and as such data collection was tailored to important measures of use and usability without the ability to evaluate its effect on clinical management or educational outcomes. Additionally, provider ECMO knowledge was based off of a self-reported perception survey which focuses on the provider's perception of their skills and knowledge. In order to fully assess the educational impact of ECMO teleconferencing, future studies should consider conducting baseline and longitudinal assessments on ECMO knowledge and practical skills.",
