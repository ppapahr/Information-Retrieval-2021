If the government decides to impose a lockdown, it has to determine its intensity, timing and duration. We find that there are two competing effects that push the decision in opposite directions. An early lockdown is beneficial not only to slow down the spread of the disease, but creates beneficial habit formation (such as social distancing, developing hygienic habits) that persists even after the lockdown is lifted. Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information about the virulence and spread of the disease in the population in addition to a direct cost to the economy. Based on the prior probability of the disease being virulent, we characterize the timing, intensity and duration of a lockdown with the above mentioned tradeoffs. Specifically, we show that as the precision of learning goes up, a government tends to delay the imposition of lockdown. Conversely, if the habit formation parameter is very strong, a government is likely to impose an early lockdown.",

While these measures no doubt lower the spread of the infection, they come with a huge cost to the economy.

            "text": "In this paper, we analyze a model of lockdown where the government (either a benevolent autocrat or a democratically elected leader) has to decide when (if at all) to impose a lockdown. Imposing a lockdown lowers the harm from the disease through lowering the rate of reproduction of the disease (the socalled R number). A lockdown also signals to the population the probable seriousness of the disease and makes them conscious of the need to take precautions against the disease via e.g. social distancing, wearing masks and practicing good hygiene. We posit that these precautionary actions often turn into habits even after a lockdown is lifted through inducing non-transitory changes in the behavior of the citizenry (see Gardner and Rebar, 2019) . This behavioral response is indeed being seen in many countries where a majority of citizens maintain social distancing and continue to reduce their social contact and take precautions against the disease even after the government eases some of the restrictions imposed earlier. As Susskind and Vines (2020) point out, the use of lockdowns thus had an additional effect of signaling how important it was to change behavior, obviating the need for long drawn out draconian lockdowns for disease containment. This idea is formalized through our habit formation parameter \u03b2 which internalizes some of the messages that a lockdown conveys. Thus, an early lockdown has a benefit of inducing changes in behavior in the population that lasts beyond the lockdown. 2 Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information (in addition to a direct cost to the economy). An early lockdown prevents the natural course of the disease and reduces its consequent public health cost but its suppression does not allow us to discover the dynamics of the disease and its consequent costs with any precision. Given the enormous cost to the economy of the lockdown, an early lockdown based on imperfect information on the severity of the disease may lead to a possibly inoptimal response e.g. imposing huge social and economic costs not warranted by the true severity of the disease.",

            "text": "While this effect has not been emphasized, there are a group of eminent scientists who have argued against a lockdown at least partly on the grounds that the data available was not precise enough to warrant a lockdown. For example, Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, U.K. does not believe that the disease is likely to be virulent enough to justify a lockdown given its huge economic and social costs. 3 Their model as well as a modification run by James Hay 4 point out that the limited data available at the time of the U.K. lockdown was consistent with different probabilities of the severity of the disease. Given this uncertainty, the case for waiting (i.e. not locking down early) would be to get more data which would allow us to form more precise estimates. This learning effect would push towards a delay in the timing of a lockdown. The present paper studies the interplay of these two independent aspects, namely, the informational loss and the behavioral benefit, and its net effect on the optimal timing and severity of a lockdown. We now describe the model in more detail, explain the main results and discuss what questions it allows us to answer.",

If it decides to impose a lockdown, it has to determine for how many periods and with what intensity. The lockdown reduces the spread of the disease but we assume no further information is forthcoming on the virulence of the disease during the lockdown. 5 If there is no lockdown in period 1, the government gets a further signal about the virulence of the disease and decides whether or not to impose a lockdown in period 2.

The strength of the backlash effect depends on various factors which we can think of summarily as representing trust in government. For a given belief about the probability of the disease being virulent, a lower trust is likely to cause people to impose higher electoral costs on the government.

This is because if economic costs of a lockdown are high, conditional on imposing a lockdown, it is better to do so early than late to get the full benefit of disease reduction because of habit formation. Our model's assumptions on disease propagation and benefits of a lockdown are consistent with standard models in epidemiology and economics. Lockdowns in epidemiological models of disease propagation are a vital tool for slowing the incidence of 6 Coibion et al. (2020) use several waves of customer surveys to analyze the effect of differential timing of lockdowns due to Covid-19 on household spending and macroeoconomic expectations at the local level. the disease. The basic models (see Anderson and May, 1992) assume that the hazard rate is an increasing function of prevalence in the population. Economic models however assume people are rational and hence even without a lockdown, they update information about disease prevalence and take precautions to reduce their chances of infection through (individually) optimal social distancing (see Geoffard and Philipson, 1996) . Nonetheless even in these fully rational models, the individual decision (i.e. choice of how much to socially distance) is not in general socially optimal as rational agents do not consider the external benefits of social distancing (see Toxvaerd, 2019) . Hence, imposing lockdowns to reduce human contact can be justified even in such models to reach the social optimum. Our model is agnostic about whether agents are fully rational and indeed abstracts from the decision of the population to focus on the government's optimal timing of lockdown.",

What is novel in our model is the trade-off between acquiring information on the dynamics of an unknown disease (which acts in favor of delaying a lockdown as it will generate data points allowing for more precise estimates via Bayesian updating) versus altering habits of the population (which acts in favor of an early lockdown). This has been generally neglected in the literature. In fact, even any analysis of uncertainty in the reproduction number has been largely missing while focusing on the trade-off in a lockdown, with one of the few papers that considers this uncertainty being (Gollier, 2020) . 8 It assumes the disease is virulent and the reproduction number is uncertain. Its focus is on lockdown intensity allowing for some learning during a (partial) lockdown, though it assumes the virus is necessarily lethal. The model does not consider the trade-off between information acquisition versus allowing disease-reducing behavior to kick in early through behavioral changes.",

This is because during a lockdown, we lose some information of the dynamics of the spread of the disease in the population i.e. which groups are most affected, what is the complication rate absent intervention etc. For analytical tractability, we assume the precision of the signal during a lockdown to be p = 1 2 .

The choice set of a is (0, 1], with a = 1 representing the highest intensity. 11 The intensity of the lockdown reduces the expected harm caused by the disease slowing its transmission because of enforced changes in social behavior.

This explains the first two terms of (3). Thus in our model, periods 1 and 2 are the current planning horizon, but the actions taken in those periods have longer term consequences due to habit formation. Imposing a lockdown entails an economic cost which is directly proportional to the intensity and the duration of the lockdown captured by (a 2 + T 2 ). \u03b3 > 0 is a cost parameter which reflects the efficacy of a government in managing the economy during a lockdown. The expression (1 \u2212 \u03c1 t )\u03b4 in the final term of (3) captures an additional cost for a democratically elected leader due to public backlash against lockdown. The higher the probability the disease is virulent, the lower is the backlash while \u03b4 captures a country specific parameter with a higher \u03b4 indicating 10 This is a simplifying assumption to model a scenario where the precision of learning goes down because of a lockdown. As we will see from the mechanism of our model, relaxing this assumption does not change our results qualitatively. As mentioned earlier, this refers to learning about the dynamics of the disease across different sub-groups. Moreover, even with learning during lockdown, the tradeoff between delaying to know more about the disease virulence versus locking down early to start beneficial habit formation earlier remains. 11 Data on lockdown measures adopted around the world indeed suggest heterogeneity in the stringency of lockdown measures across countries. For example, Spain adopted very stringent measures with no one allowed to go out of their home while in the UK it was more relaxed. If we interpret lockdown more generally as a measure of social restriction, then Sweden represents a case of the lowest intensity lockdown. 12 This gives us a well behaved function which is concave in the relevant region in which a will be optimally chosen. Allowing for the harm to increase at high levels of a captures the fact that too stringent measures may increase harm by limiting access to medical care or providing social support at home. Of course, the optimal a would never lie in that region.",

This can be intuitively explained as follows. Consider the alternate policies of imposing a lockdown in period 1 for two periods and imposing a lockdown in period 2. The benefit due to habit formation from both these policies are for the same number of periods, i.e. A. However, the latter policy has the additional advantage of acting after receiving a more precise signal about the virulence of the disease. Additionally, a later lockdown reduces the negative impact on the economy by one period. This makes imposition of lockdown more likely in period 2.",

In the present paragraph, by lockdown, unless otherwise stated, we will refer to lockdown imposed in period 1. We first show that the payoff from lockdown for one period is higher than \u2212\u03c1 1 r(A + 2) if \u03c1 1 exceeds a threshold \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 1 , which is strictly lower than \u03c1 * 1 , which is strictly less than that in period 2. Since payoff functions are continuous, we know that the conclusion will continue to hold for some p at the right neighborhood of 1 2 , and let p * \u2208 ( 1 2 , 1] be the supremum of such p's. This means whenever p < p * , we have \u03c1 * 1 < \u03c1 * 2 . From Lemma 1 we can further conclude that when p < p * , at the right neighborhood of \u03c1 * 1 , lockdown will always be imposed for one period. Finally, suppose p * < 1. From the definition of p * , we can conclude that at the right neighborhood of p * , the optimal welfare from lockdown at the belief \u03c1 * 2 will be less than or equal to the continuation payoff at that belief. While the optimal payoff from lockdown in period 1 is unaffected by the learning parameter p, the continuation payoff is strictly increasing in it. Hence, we can conclude that for all p > p * , we have \u03c1 * 1 > \u03c1 * 2 . The above result can be intuitively explained as follows. The tradeoff between imposing a lockdown early and waiting is as follows. If a lockdown is imposed earlier, the benefit through behavioral change in the event that the disease is virulent lasts longer. On the other hand, imposing a lockdown earlier means the government is unable to learn about the nature of the disease. Thus it may impose a lockdown when the disease happens to be relatively mild and needlessly suffer the economic costs. Given a behavioral pattern, which is captured by the parameter \u03b2, the government has a higher incentive to impose the lockdown earlier if the precision of the learning is below a certain level in which case there would not be much gain in learning by waiting for one period. This explains why the threshold for imposing a lockdown in period 1 is lower than that in period 2. In Proposition 1 we have shown that at the right neighborhood of the threshold in period 1, the government always imposes a lockdown for one period. However, if the value of \u03c1 1 is very high, it is possible that the government optimally chooses to impose a lockdown for two periods.",

We can observe that for low values of p, \u03c1 * 1 is unaffected by p, but as p increases, \u03c1 * 1 also increases in p. To understand this, recall from our model that \u03c1 * 1 is determined by the point of intersection of the payoff from lockdown in period 1, and the continuation payoff \u0393 (\u03c1 1 ). For values of \u03c1 1 <\u03c1 1 , \u0393 (\u03c1 1 ) = \u2212\u03c1 1 r(A+2), which is independent of p.

While an imposition of lockdown in period 2 generates the benefit from habit formation during period 3, a lockdown imposed in period 1 for one period, generates the benefit from habit formation in both periods 2 and 3. 16 In the absence of any 16 We can verify that in the current calibrated model, at the right neighbourhood of \u03c1 * 1 , optimal length of lockdown is always equal to 1. habit formation, i.e. \u03b2 = 0, it is more beneficial to impose the lockdown in period 2, as this comes with the benefit of getting a more precise signal about the likelihood of the virulence of the disease, allowing for a more informed choice of a in period 2.",

However, as \u03b2 increases, the option of imposing an early lockdown in period 1 becomes more attractive as it now comes with the benefit of habit formation for an additional period. Thus, as \u03b2 crosses a threshold, \u03c1 * 1 lies below \u03c1 * 2 . In both Figs. 2 and 3, this pattern is displayed. Next, we explain the effects of an increase in the value of A. First, the threshold of \u03b2 above which \u03c1 * 1 is below \u03c1 * 2 increases. Second, the relative difference between \u03c1 * 1 and \u03c1 * 2 goes down. These observations can be intuitively explained as follows. Irrespective of the timing of the lockdown, the benefit of habit formation is always present during the third period. The imposition of an early lockdown brings in the additional benefit of habit formation in period 2. As A, the length of period 3 goes up, the relative significance of this additional benefit in period 2 from early lockdown declines. This explains why as A increases, the difference between \u03c1 * 1 and \u03c1 * 2 (for a given \u03b2) becomes smaller.",

This follows from the fact that the less able a government is in handling the economy during a lockdown (i.e. higher values of \u03b3 ), the more reluctant a government is to impose a lockdown in a particular period, i.e. \u03c1 * t higher (t = 1, 2). Thus, from both the figures we can observe that as \u03b3 goes up, both \u03c1 * 1 and \u03c1 * 2 go up. However, the rate of increase in \u03c1 * 1 is lower than the rate of increase in \u03c1 * 2 . This implies that for higher values of \u03b3 the relative benefit of early lockdown is higher. The first observation follows from the fact that as \u03b3 goes up, the cost of lockdown in any period goes up, raising the thresholds for lockdown in both periods. To understand the second observation, consider a government which is deciding between an early or a late lockdown. Irrespective of the timing of the lockdown, the cost incurred will be the same. However, the early lockdown has the additional benefit of habit formation in period 2. A government with a higher value of \u03b3 is less efficient in managing the economy during a lockdown. This implies, at the new optimum, the marginal benefit from imposing a lockdown should be equal to this higher marginal cost. The government achieves this by imposing an early lockdown so that it can reap the additional benefit from habit formation in period 2. This explains why \u03c1 * 1 increases less in comparison to \u03c1 * 2 as \u03b3 increases. This effect is more prominent for higher values of \u03b2 as evident from Fig. 5 .",

            "text": "We have presented a stylized model of a disease with unknown virulence to illustrate the trade-off between learning and habit formation that have opposing impacts on the timing of a lockdown. To isolate this trade-off, we simplify on a number of dimensions including not explicitly modeling the decision of other agents in the population as well as ruling out strategic considerations. We believe strategic considerations to be minimal in a large population. Political considerations do play a role in a government's decisions to impose a lockdown in terms of its timing and intensity. While we do not model this explicitly, political issues are partly captured by the variable \u03b4 which proxies for how much trust there is in government. A lower \u03b4 implies a higher trust and thus lower public backlash against the lockdown. We have also simplified the disease propagation mechanism by a single parameter that can be interpreted as the virulence or harm. Assuming this is proportional to the reproduction rate, this could have been embedded in a standard SIR model. 18 where this reproduction rate would need to be greater than 1 for the disease to spread over time. While the harm or virulence r being modeled as a binary variable is a simplification, we think it captures the key qualitative features of a more realistic model where the virulence can take on more values. There are other simplifying assumptions, e.g. habit formation can also directly affect the economy if people stay home post lockdown and reduce demand in certain sectors, whereas in our model this is only captured through the equilibrium choice of a. Allowing a more direct impact would push towards a later lockdown but once again preserve the qualitative features of the model. Our model suggests some interesting implications for the timing of lockdown both within and across countries. Holding everything else constant, one might have expected countries facing the pandemic later to adopt earlier lockdowns as they already had recourse to information from other countries. But as the model shows, this effect is moderated by factors such as the cost to the economy, trust in the government and country specific information (e.g. age composition) that can affect the virulence of the disease. Importantly, governments may over-estimate or under-estimate the strength of the habit formation parameter of the population. One can estimate differences in values of \u03b2 across countries by the level of compliance of the population with the suggested guidelines from the government. However, a government may not necessarily estimate the value of \u03b2 accurately. In the U.K., the government was criticized for delaying the lockdown, but it seems (from copies of meetings of the scientific advisory group) that there was a general belief that the U.K. population would not comply or reach behavioral fatigue (see Mahase, 18 See Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . 2020). 19 While the government may have underestimated the degree of compliance in the population with the guidelines on social distancing, it nonetheless rationalizes the ex ante decision of the government. Reports of the U.K.'s scientific advisory committee minutes also reveal how initial decisions were being reformulated as new data arrived on the disease and expert advice was being sought how to induce lasting behavioral changes through messaging during the lockdown 20 in line with our model. These suggest that the tradeoffs we suggest in our model indeed played a crucial role in the decision to lockdown. Further, it points out that countries that have been ex post criticized for acting late may have been gathering data before taking the extreme step of a lockdown.",

In this case \u0393 (\u03c1 1 ) = \u2212\u03c1 1 r(A + 2). Since \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 1 < \u03c1 * 2 , and from Lemma 1, \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 1 is strictly less than the belief at which W * 1 intersects \u0393 . This means we haveThis implies at the right neighborhood of p = 1 2 , we haveSuppose p * < 1. This means for p = p * \u2212 \u03f5, \u03c1 * 1 = \u03c1 * 2 \u2212 \u03c8 such that \u03f5 > 0, \u03c8 > 0 and \u03c8 \u2192 0 as \u03f5 \u2192 0.Thus, at the right neighborhood of pis increasing in p, and W f 1 is unaffected by p. Therefore, it follows that for all p > p * , \u03c1 * 1 > \u03c1 * 2 . This concludes the proof.",
