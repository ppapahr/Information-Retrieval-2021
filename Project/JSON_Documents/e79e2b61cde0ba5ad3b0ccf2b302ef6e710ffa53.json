In brief, genome plasmids were constructed expressing a codon-optimised T1-3B bnAb (GenBank: KP231622.1; KP231643.1)[2] in the single-ORF expression configuration described previously [3], or a CpG-free Gaussia Luciferase (soGLux), inserted via unique NheI and PsPOMI sites, and driven by the hCEF promoter [4]. Vectors were purified using anion exchange chromatography and tangential flow filtration and formulated into either FreeStyle293 media or TSSM buffer (tromethamine 20 mM, NaCl 100 mM, sucrose 10 mg/mL, and mannitol 10 mg/mL). The functional titre of lentiviral vectors was determined based on the genomic integration of WPRE DNA sequence. Suspension HEK293F cells were transduced with dilutions of purified lentiviral vectors in FreeStyle293 media in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/mL of polybrene. Cells were incubated for 72 hours before genomic DNA was extracted. The integrated WPRE DNA was quantified against a standard curve of DNA mimics containing the WPRE sequence using the following primers: Forward: TGGCGTGGTGTGCACTGT; Reverse: CCCGGAAAGGAGCTGACA; Probe: FAM-TTGCTGACGCAACCCCCACTGG-TAMRA in triplicate using TaqMan FAST Universal Master Mix, normalised against total ng DNA. The PCR profile used was as following: 50\u00baC for 2 min, 95\u00baC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00baC for 15 sec and 60\u00baC for 1 min. Functional transducing units per mL of virus supernatant (TU/mL) was determined from the slope of a linear regression curve generated from the dilution series.",
