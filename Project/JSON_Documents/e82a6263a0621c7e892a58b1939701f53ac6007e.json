Treatment ordinal outcome proportions under an odds ratio of 1.75 for five scenarios in Table 6 Notes: 1 Refer to Section 8.1 of the protocol for details of clinical data to be collected including ordinal score, NEWS, oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilator requirement, etc. 2 Screening laboratory tests include: ALT, AST, creatinine (and calculate an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) the formula used is determined by the sites, but should be consistent throughout the study), and pregnancy test. See stage-specific appendix as additional screening laboratory tests may be added based on study product risk profile. 3 Laboratory tests performed in the 48 hours prior to enrollment will be accepted for determination of eligibility. 4 Baseline assessments should be performed prior to first study product administration. Laboratory tests performed as part of routine clinical care in the 24 hours prior to first dose will be accepted for the baseline safety laboratory tests. Baseline may be the same as the screening laboratory tests. 5 Safety laboratory tests include WBC with differential, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and PT. See stage-specific appendix as additional safety laboratory tests may be added based on study product risk profile. 6 Any laboratory tests performed as part of routine clinical care within the specified visit window can be used for safety laboratory testing. Window during the 10 days of dosing is \u00b11 day. 7 In-person visits are preferred but recognizing quarantine and other factors may limit the subject's ability to return to the site for the visit. In this case, the visit may be performed by phone.",

The NEW Score should be evaluated daily while hospitalized and on Days 15 and 29. It can be performed concurrently with the Ordinal Scale. This should be evaluated at a consistent time for each study day and prior to administration of study product. The 7 parameters can be obtained from the hospital chart or electronic medical record (EMR) using the last measurement prior to the time of assessment and a numeric score is given for each parameter (e.g., a RR of 9 is one point, oxygen saturation of 92 is two points). This is recorded for the day obtained (i.e., on Day 3, the vital signs and other parameters from Day 3 are used to obtain NEW Score for Day 3). ECMO and mechanically ventilated subjects should be assigned a score of 3 for RR (RR <8) regardless of the ventilator setting.

These AEs were temporary, lasting only a few days, and none were serious. In clinical studies, transient elevations in ALT and AST have been observed with single doses of remdesivir up to 225 mg and multiple once daily doses of remdesivir 150 mg for up to 14 days. Mild (Grade 1) reversible PT prolongation was also noted in some subjects but without any clinically significant change in INR or other evidence of hepatic effects. The mechanism of these elevations is currently unknown. Based on these clinical observations, patients with ALT or AST >5 times the upper limit of normal will not be eligible for study enrollment.

In addition, the adaptive design allows for the evaluation of new therapeutic agents as they are identified and ready for testing in clinical trials. As the study is a multicenter, multinational randomized controlled study, we will be able to acquire rigorous data about the safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutic agents for COVID-19 that will lead to generalizable evidence. Randomization is essential for establishing efficacy of these new therapeutic agents.

The NEWS is being used as an efficacy measure. The NEW Score should be evaluated daily while hospitalized and on Days 15 and 29. It can be performed concurrently with the Ordinal Scale. This should be evaluated at a consistent time for each study day and prior to administration of study product. The 7 parameters can be obtained from the hospital chart or electronic medical record (EMR) using the last measurement prior to the time of assessment and a numeric score is given for each parameter (e.g., a RR of 9 is one point, oxygen saturation of 92 is two points). This is recorded for the day obtained (i.e., on Day 3, the vital signs and other parameters from Day 3 are used to obtain NEW Score for Day 3). ECMO and mechanically ventilated subjects should be assigned a score of 3 for RR (RR <8) regardless of the ventilator setting. Subjects on ECMO should get a score of 3 for heart rate since they are on cardiopulmonary bypass. ",

The potent antiinflammatory effects of baricitinib have also been demonstrated by the reduction of serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, GM-CSF and MCP-1 in pediatric patients with steroid-dependent chronic inflammation, resulting in control of disease activity and the ability to wean or taper steroids (36) .",

In addition, baricitinib has been identified as a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor with high-affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1-8.2 nM, BIKE-20 nM and GAK-120 nM). AAK1 and GAK were previously described as a crucial regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and propagation of coronavirus and other viruses (37) .

An additional four patients have received treatment but are pending recovery.

Addition of new experimental therapies: If additional data become available to add an experimental therapy, the sample size will be updated accordingly. Analyses of newly added arm(s) will be performed comparing concurrently enrolled control subjects. This approach was used in the recent PALM study in patients with Ebola virus disease (7).",

The number of recoveries for these three scenarios is described below. With the default assumptions of all 4 arms being available, and the results of ACTT1 not being known, this would multi-arm trial would therefore require 800 recoveries. With the default assumption that 70% of subjects achieve recovered in 28 days, the total sample size is approximately 1040. Table 18 displays five scenarios considered for outcome probabilities in the placebo arm for sample size determination. There is significant uncertainty with these assumptions given the limited data available. Table 18 shows a range of sample sizes for odds ratios ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 for 85% power. For 90% power, increase the sample size by 17%.

Multiple nonhuman primate studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir against Ebola virus (4, 5) . Remdesivir was used in a randomized clinical trial for Ebola (the PALM study) (7) . While remdesivir was demonstrated to be inferior to investigational treatment with monoclonal antibodies MAb114 and REGN-EB3 in the PALM study, the lack of a control arm limits interpretation of the clinical efficacy of remdesivir. Studies in human airway epithelial cell assays demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits replication of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV (8) . In mouse infection models, remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (8, 9) . In vitro studies with mouse hepatitis virus (a murine coronavirus) found that remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication through interference with the viral polymerase, despite the presence of a viral proofreading exoribonuclease (10) . In that study, coronaviruses that were partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir were still sensitive to higher concentrations of remdesivir, and fitness was impaired in the resistant viruses as compared to wild-type MERS-CoV. In a recent non-human primate study, therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 hours post inoculation with MERS-CoV provided clinical benefit with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions (11, 12) . These nonclinical data suggest that remdesivir might be useful for the treatment of COVID-19 for which no medical countermeasures are currently approved, and support testing the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with having blood drawn, the IV catheterization, possible reactions to remdesivir (as noted in Section 2.3.2), and breach of confidentiality.",

SARS-CoV patients were treated with corticosteroids, type 1 IFN agents, convalescent plasma, ribavirin, and lopinavir or ritonavir, and except for ribavirin, many of these agents have in vitro pre-clinical data that support their efficacy (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003, new therapeutic agents targeting viral entry proteins, proteases, polymerases, and methyltransferases have been tested; however, none of them has been shown to be efficacious in clinical trials (26) (27) (28) .",

This should be evaluated at a consistent time for each study day and prior to administration of study product. The 7 parameters can be obtained from the hospital chart or electronic medical record (EMR) using the last measurement prior to the time of assessment and a numeric score is given for each parameter (e.g., a RR of 9 is one point, oxygen saturation of 92 is two points). This is recorded for the day obtained (i.e., on Day 3, the vital signs and other parameters from Day 3 are used to obtain NEW Score for Day 3). ECMO and mechanically ventilated subjects should be assigned a score of 3 for RR (RR <8) regardless of the ventilator setting.

Baricitinib treatment resulted in a reduction from baseline in serum IL-6 at Week 12 in patients with active RA in a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study of baricitinib (data on file). The potent anti-inflammatory effects of baricitinib have also been demonstrated by the reduction of serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, GM-CSF and MCP-1 in pediatric patients with steroid-dependent chronic inflammation, resulting in control of disease activity and the ability to wean or taper steroids (36) . (32), suggested a potential role for baricitinib in the treatment of COVID-19. The authors hypothesize that baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, will directly mitigate the inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, baricitinib has been identified as a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor with high-affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1-8.2 nM, BIKE-20 nM and GAK-120 nM). AAK1 and GAK were previously described as a crucial regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and propagation of coronavirus and other viruses (37) .

Few subjects to date experienced constipation, heartburn, itching, unusual feelings in the ear, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, shaking of the leg and arm, headache, loose stool, or upset stomach. These AEs were temporary, lasting only a few days, and none were serious. In clinical studies, transient elevations in ALT and AST have been observed with single doses of remdesivir up to 225 mg and multiple once daily doses of remdesivir 150 mg for up to 14 days. Mild (Grade 1) reversible PT prolongation was also noted in some subjects but without any clinically significant change in INR or other evidence of hepatic effects. The mechanism of these elevations is currently unknown. Based on these clinical observations, patients with ALT or AST >5 times the upper limit of normal will not be eligible for study enrollment. Regular laboratory assessments will be performed in order to monitor hepatic function and PT. Any observed liver function-related laboratory abnormalities or possibly related AEs will be treated appropriately and followed to resolution. In nonclinical animal studies, toxicity studies found dose-dependent and reversible kidney injury and dysfunction. In clinical studies, no evidence of nephrotoxicity has been observed with single doses of remdesivir up to 225 mg or multiple once daily doses of remdesivir 150 mg for up to 14 days. A 150-mg dose of the solution and lyophilized formulations of remdesivir contains 9 g and 4.5 g, respectively, of sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD), for which the maximum daily recommended daily dose (based on a European Medicines Agency (EMA) safety review) is approximately 250 mg/kg. Because SBECD is renally cleared, subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment may have SBECD exposures greater than those with less severe renal impairment or normal renal function. Based on this information, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml/min (including subjects requiring hemodialysis or hemofiltration) will not be eligible for study enrollment.",

The DSMB asked that the sponsor be unblinded early given public health implications and implications for ACTT-2. As a result, all subjects in ACTT-2 will be given remdesivir. This is a benefit to participation, though at some point this drug may be available outside of clinical trials. In addition, society may benefit from their participation in this study resulting from insights gained about the efficacy of remdesivir combined with baricitinib, a licensed, readily-available drug. Determining if additional clinical benefit can be realized by combining an antiviral with an anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of COVID-19 may benefit society during this global COVID-19 pandemic.",

An integrated analysis of patients with active RA exposed to baricitinib with 3770 patients and 10,127 patient years for a maximum exposure of 7 years (as of February 2018) was recently published (38) . No significant differences were seen for baricitinib 4-mg vs placebo in adverse events leading to permanent drug discontinuation, death, malignancy, serious infection, or major adverse cardiovascular events. Incidence rates for deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism were numerically higher in baricitinib 4-mg vs placebo; Incidence rates were similar by dose in 2-mg/4-mg-extended dataset. Malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) Incidence rates were 0.8 (2-mg) and 1.0 (4-mg; as-randomized analysis). Fewer than 1% of patients discontinued due to abnormal laboratory results. The frequency of Herpes zoster was higher for baricitinib 4-mg vs placebo (1. It is difficult to extrapolate the potential risks of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis to a COVID-19 population. The duration of baricitinib treatment will be limited to up to 14 days in this study and the half-life is approximately 12 hours which will lead to a very short washout period once discontinued. JAK-STAT signal blocking by baricitinib produces an impairment of interferon responses. Interferons are important for the innate control of viral replication. Thus baricitinib Adverse drug reactions of baricitinib include venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis /pulmonary embolism). Mitigating the risk of venous thromboembolism will be managed through adding appropriate exclusion and discontinuation criteria to the protocol to limit participation of patients who are at an increased risk of VTE. There is evidence to suggest that COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic events from infection with SARS-CoV-2. The etiology this may be tissue injury from the SARS-CoV-2 or may be due to inflammation via pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation of tissue factor. It is unknown if baricitinib would increase or decrease this risk. Investigators are recommended to add VTE prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients given the risk of VTE. As thrombocytopenia can be seen in COVID-19, the risk/benefit of VTE prophylaxis should be made by the treating clinician.",

It can be performed concurrently with the Ordinal Scale. This should be evaluated at a consistent time for each study day and prior to administration of study product. The 7 parameters can be obtained from the hospital chart or electronic medical record (EMR) using the last measurement prior to the time of assessment (including parameters collected prior to the time of consent) and a numeric score is given for each parameter (e.g., a RR of 9 is one point, oxygen saturation of 92 is two points).

For the log-rank test, the two key determinants of power are the total number of events (i.e., recoveries) E and the treatment-to-control ratio of the rate of recovery, R. The number of events required for power 1 \u2212 to detect a recovery rate ratio of \u03b8 using a two-tailed test at alpha=0.05 is approximately The force of recovery (sometimes loosely referred to as the \"recovery ratio\") is the analogue of the hazard ratio and the term \"recovery rate ratio\" is the analogue of the hazard ratio in this setting. A recovery rate ratio of 1.31 was reported in Cao, Wang, Wen et al. (2020) for a lopinavir/ritonavir trial that used time to improvement by 2 categories as primary endpoint. A preliminary review of data from ACTT-1 demonstrated a recovery rate ratio 1.312. It is unlikely the second component of treatment will have a similar effect size. Therefore a recovery ratio of 1.25 is assumed for this trial. A total of 723 recoveries are needed for a recovery ratio of 1.25 with 85% power. Table 5 provides power for various recovery rate ratios. The study will accrue until approximately 723 recoveries have been achieved. The date of study closure will be estimated based on enrollment rate and recovery/enrollment percentages. If approximately 70% of participants recover, the total sample size will be 1032. Key secondary: A sample size can be computed using an (assumed) ordinal scale distribution for the control arm and the odds ratio representing clinical improvement. The odds ratio represents the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale for combination treatment relative to the control arm . The sample size to detect a given odds ratio for 1:1 randomization using a 2-tailed test at level \u03b1 is given by",

A recovery rate ratio of 1.31 was reported in Cao, Wang, Wen et al. (2020) for a lopinavir/ritonavir trial that used time to improvement by 2 categories as primary endpoint. A preliminary review of data from ACTT-1 demonstrated a recovery rate ratio 1.312. It is unlikely the second component of treatment will have a similar effect size. Therefore a recovery ratio of 1.25 is assumed for this trial. A total of 723 recoveries are needed for a recovery ratio of 1.25 with 85% power. The study will accrue until approximately 723 recoveries have been achieved. The date of study closure will be estimated based on enrollment rate and recovery/enrollment percentages. If approximately 70% of participants recover, the total sample size will be 1032. ",

The median time to event and CI in each treatment group Statistical Analysis Plan -DMID Protocol: 20-0006 (ACTT2) Version 1.0 12JUN2020 will be summarized along with the treatment hazard ratio estimate and log rank p-value (Table 16 ). Differences in time-to-event endpoints by treatment arm will be summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves ( Figure 10 ). Number at risk, hazard ratio and log rank p-values will be presented on the figures. The analyses (and tabular and graphical summaries) will be repeated using the outcome of time to improvement in two categories of the ordinal scale defined in Section 3.3. In addition, a subgroup analysis time to improvement among subjects enrolled with a clinical score of 7 will be performed using the retreatment censoring plan.",

Baricitinib treatment resulted in a reduction from baseline in serum IL-6 at Week 12 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study of baricitinib (data on file). The potent anti-inflammatory effects of baricitinib have also been demonstrated by the reduction of serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) in pediatric patients with steroid-dependent chronic inflammation, resulting in control of disease activity and the ability to wean or taper steroids.",

Baricitinib has a well-established safety profile, based on clinical trial data and post-marketing data in patients with RA. This profile, together with the observation that baricitinib is a potent AAK1/BIKE/GAK inhibitor with known anti-cytokine effects, provide the rationale to study baricitinib in the context of a randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients with COVID-19.",

The model will be fit in the ITT and Treated analysis populations. The treatment group hazard ratios and CIs and the interaction term p-value will be reported. Finally, the results of the sensitivity time-to event analysis described in Section 6.4 will be presented in a table; the same summaries as in Table 66 will be provided. As requested by the DSMB, a restricted mean survival time analysis of mortality will be performed as an exploratory analysis.

II TABLE OF CONTENTS ...............................................................................................................III LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS ....................................................................................................... VI The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for \"A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Blinded Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Adults\" (DMID Protocol 20-0006) describes and expands upon the statistical information presented in the protocol. This protocol is an adaptive protocol with different stages. Each stage will have a separate SAP. This SAP is for the study's 2 nd stage \"ACTT-2\": Baricitinib + Remdesivir vs. Remdesivir. This document describes all planned analyses and provides reasons and justifications for these analyses. It also includes sample tables, listings, and figures planned for the final analyses. Regarding the final analyses and Clinical Study Report (CSR), this SAP follows the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guidelines, as indicated in Topic E3 (Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports), and more generally is consistent with Topic E8 (General Considerations for Clinical Trials) and Topic E9 (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials). The structure and content of the SAP provides sufficient detail to meet the requirements identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and ICH, while all work planned and reported for this SAP will follow internationally accepted guidelines published by the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society for statistical practice.This document contains: a review of the study design, general statistical considerations, comprehensive statistical analysis methods for efficacy and safety outcomes, and a list of proposed tables, figures and listings. Within the table, figure, and listing mock-ups (Appendices 1, 2, and 3), references to CSR sections are included. Any deviation from this SAP will be described and justified in protocol amendments and/or in the CSR, as appropriate. The reader of this SAP is encouraged to also review the study protocol for details on conduct of the study and the operational aspects of clinical assessments.A preliminary review of data from ACTT-1 occurring after 606 recoveries and 103 deaths (approximately 67% of the 1063 subjects enrolled) demonstrated that subjects that received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery (11 vs 15 days, recovery rate ratio 1.312 (1.119, 1.541), p<0.001), and a decrease in mortality (8.0% vs 11.6%, p = 0.059). The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) asked that the sponsor be unblinded early given public health implications and implications for ACTT-2.",
