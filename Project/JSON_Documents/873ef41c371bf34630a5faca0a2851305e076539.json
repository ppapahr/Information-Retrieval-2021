Over the course of five weeks, we did not find a significant change in the age distribution of patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI) and tested for COVID-19, however we did find a significant shift towards younger patients in those testing positive for COVID-19. The simplest explanation for the shift towards younger patients testing positive could be relaxing testing criteria. For example, guidelines at our institution went from requiring ILI symptoms and a known COVID-19 exposure, to expressing symptoms consistent with ILI, to medical doctor discretion. However, this does not explain why there is no change in the demographics of patients getting tested for COVID-19. A more plausible explanation is that because of the SIP order, the at-risk elderly population is protected and hence less likely to contract COVID-19. This interpretation is supported by the fact that despite seeing a larger number of younger COVID-19 positive patients, those that need to be admitted have similar ages, rate of ICU admission, and length of stay as before the SIP order; now we see fewer absolute numbers of such cases.",
