On histological examination, evidence of over-activation of T cells and increased Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells has been reported [11] . Another possible mechanism is via direct insult by SARS-CoV-2 akin to SARS-CoV. Finally, a third hypothesis is injury via an ischemic process related to hypoxia.
