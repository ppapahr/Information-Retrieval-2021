The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryoelectron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3\u02b9-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3\u02b9-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3\u02b9-exonuclease. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.",

The RdRp consists of three non-structural protein (nsp) subunits, the catalytic subunit nsp12 6 and the accessory subunits nsp8 and nsp7 3, 7 . Structures of the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained in free form 8 and with RNA template-product duplexes [9] [10] [11] . Together with a prior structure of SARS-CoV RdRp 12 , these results have elucidated the RdRp mechanism. For RNA-dependent RNA elongation, the 3\u02b9-terminal nucleotide of the RNA product chain resides in the -1 site and the incoming nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate binds to the adjacent +1 site. Catalytic nucleotide incorporation then triggers RNA translocation and liberates the +1 site for binding of the next incoming nucleoside triphosphate (NTP).",

Remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug that is metabolized in cells to yield an active NTP analog 21 that we refer to as remdesivir triphosphate (RTP) . Biochemical studies showed that the RdRp can use RTP as a substrate, leading to the incorporation of remdesivir monophosphate (RMP) into the growing RNA product 10, 20, 22 . After RMP incorporation, the RdRp extends RNA by three more nucleotides before it stalls 10, 20, 22 .

To investigate remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling, we first investigated how RTP (Fig. 1a) influences RdRp elongation activity on an RNA template-product scaffold (Fig. 1b) using a highly defined biochemical system (Methods). Consistent with recent studies 20, 22 , we observed that RMP is readily incorporated into RNA and that the RNA is subsequently elongated by three more nucleotides before the RdRp stalls (Fig. 1c, d) . At high NTP concentrations, RdRp stalling was largely overcome and the fulllength RNA product was formed despite the presence of RMP in the RNA product (Fig. 1c, d) . Thus, the predominant mechanism of remdesivir action after its incorporation into the growing RNA is delayed RdRp stalling. Although we cannot exclude that a minor fraction of RdRp-RNA complexes may dissociate and terminate elongation, the stalling mechanism is also observed in a recent single-molecule study 27 .",

First, this cyano group is critical for antiviral potency against Ebola virus 21 . Second, modeling the RMP at position -4 of the RNA product strand results in a steric clash with the side chain of serine-861 in nsp12 10, 20 . Indeed, our structural data strongly support the modeling (Fig. 3c) . Third, truncation of serine-861 to alanine 10, 28 or glycine 28 renders the RdRp less sensitive or insensitive, respectively, to inhibition by remdesivir.

After digestion, protein was passed through a HisTrap HP 5 ml column and a HiTrap Q 5 ml column (GE Healthcare). Flow-through containing the protein of interest was concentrated and further purified on a HiLoad S200 16/ 600 pg column equilibrated in size exclusion buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, aliquoted, flash-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. All protein purification steps were done at 4\u00b0C.",

The first RNA strand forms the RNA templateproduct hairpin and lacks the last 15 nt at the 3\u02b9 end. The second strand contains the missing 15 nt sequence. Upon scaffold annealing, a complete RNA templateproduct is formed with a single nick in the product RNA. This strategy had to be used because the length of the remdesivir-containing oligonucleotides was limited due to technical reasons. RNA scaffolds for RdRp-RNA complex formation were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of two RNA strands in annealing buffer (10 mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl) and heating to 75\u00b0C, followed by stepwise cooling to 4\u00b0C.
