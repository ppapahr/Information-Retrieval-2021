However, there is a variety of intervention types and their differential efficacy is widely unclear. The aim of the planned network meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of family interventions that differ in content (e.g. psychoeducation, mutual support, skills training) and setting (e.g. duration, inclusion of patient, form of delivery). Methods and analysis: We will include randomized controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions directed at the adult relatives, friends, or non-professional carers of people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum) to any kind of control condition. The main outcome will be global clinical state for the patients and coping with psychosis as well as attitudes towards psychosis for the relatives. Additional outcomes will be severity of symptoms, functioning, burden, and compliance/drop-out. We will conduct a comprehensive search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists of previous review articles. Full-text assessment of eligibility, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment will be done by two independent reviewers. A network meta-analysis will be conducted for any of the planned outcomes and intervention characteristics for which sufficient and appropriate data is available. The analyses will make use of a random effects model within a frequentist framework. Estimates for all pairwise treatment effects will be obtained using standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for binary outcomes. Interventions will be ranked according to their relative efficacy. We will address the assumption of transitivity, heterogeneity, and inconsistency using theoretical and statistical approaches. The possibility of publication bias and the strength of evidence will also be examined. Ethics and dissemination: There are no ethical concerns.",

This study aims to compare the types of family interventions in a systematic and consistent manner, using the method of network metaanalysis (NMA). NMA extends on classical meta-analyses because it allows to simultaneously compare multiple intervention types and to combine the evidence of direct comparisons with indirect comparisons to common control conditions [21, 22]. This enables us to evaluate the comparative efficacy of intervention types that have not yet been directly compared. Due to the possibility to include additional information, the efficacy can also be estimated more precisely [23]. Finally, all intervention types can be ranked according to their relative efficacy. This information could be of high value for patients, their families, as well as healthcare providers and may serve as a guideline for delivering the most efficacious interventions.",

High levels of expressed emotions (EE), i.e. criticism, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement expressed by the family [6] , were shown to be a reliable predictor of relapse in numerous studies [7] . Additionally, relatives are often the primary caregivers of patients with psychosis and are thus generally considered \"important in the process of assessment and engagement in treatment and also in the successful delivery of effective interventions and therapies for people with psychotic disorders\" [4; British NICE guidelines, p. 28]. As a result, attempts were made to positively influence the course of psychotic disorders by improving its management within the patients' families. However, caring for a person with a psychotic disorder is often a heavy burden and relatives face considerable emotional, social, and economical challenges [8] [9] [10] . These stressful conditions are likely not only to affect the well-being of the relatives, but also to limit their long-term ability to support the patient. Therefore, reducing the burden of care and enhancing the wellbeing of carers has become an additional focus of family interventions.",

The aim of the planned network meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of family interventions that differ in content (e.g. psychoeducation, mutual support, skills training) and setting (e.g. number of sessions, inclusion of patient, form of delivery). Methods and analysis: We will include randomized controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions directed at the adult relatives, friends, or non-professional carers of people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum) to any kind of control condition. The main outcome will be global clinical state for the patients and coping with psychosis as well as attitudes towards psychosis for the relatives.",

A network meta-analysis will be conducted for any of the planned outcomes and intervention characteristics for which sufficient and appropriate data is available. The analyses will make use of a random effects model within a frequentist framework. Estimates for all pairwise treatment effects will be obtained using standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. Interventions will be ranked according to their relative efficacy. We will address the assumption of transitivity, heterogeneity, and inconsistency using theoretical and statistical approaches. The possibility of publication bias and the strength of evidence will also be examined. Ethics and dissemination: There are no ethical concerns. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at practitioners' conferences. The study has been registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020148728).",

High levels of expressed emotions (EE), i.e. criticism, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement expressed by the family [6] , were shown to be a reliable predictor of relapse in numerous studies [7] . Additionally, relatives are often the primary caregivers of patients with psychosis and are thus generally considered \"important in the process of assessment and engagement in treatment and also in the successful delivery of effective interventions and therapies for people with psychotic disorders\" [4; British NICE guidelines, p. 28]. As a result, attempts were made to positively influence the course of psychotic disorders by improving its management within the patients' families. However, caring for a person with a psychotic disorder is often a heavy burden and relatives face considerable emotional, social, and economical challenges [8] [9] [10] . These stressful conditions are likely not only to affect the well-being of the relatives, but also to limit their long-term ability to support the patient. Therefore, reducing the burden of care and enhancing the wellbeing of carers has become an additional focus of family interventions.",

This enables us to evaluate the comparative efficacy of intervention types that have not yet been directly compared. Due to the possibility to include additional information, the efficacy can also be estimated more precisely [27] . Finally, all intervention types can be ranked according to their relative efficacy.

For this assumption to hold, trials that investigate different types of interventions need to be comparable in regard to clinical or methodological variables that may influence the treatment effect. However, the intervention types we plan to investigate may not be independent of each other. E.g., psychoeducative interventions may have fewer sessions than other content types, which would threaten the transitivity of the NMA for content and number of sessions. Other potential effect modifiers are participant or outcome characteristics. E.g., the type of family intervention might differ depending on the severity of the relatives' dysfunction/distress, which was found to be associated with the efficacy of interventions, or interventions with more sessions may report on outcomes with longer follow-up periods.",

We conducted a comprehensive search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE(R), PsycInfo, CINAHL (08/08/2019), and reference lists of review articles. Full-text assessment of eligibility, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment will be done by two independent reviewers. A network meta-analysis will be conducted for any of the planned outcomes and intervention characteristics for which sufficient and appropriate data is available. The analyses will make use of a random effects model within a frequentist framework. Estimates for all pairwise treatment effects will be obtained using standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. Interventions will be ranked according to their relative efficacy. We will address the assumption of transitivity, heterogeneity, and inconsistency using theoretical and statistical approaches. The possibility of publication bias and the strength of evidence will also be examined. Ethics and dissemination: There are no ethical concerns. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at practitioners' conferences. The study has been registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020148728).",

High levels of expressed emotions (EE), i.e. criticism, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement expressed by the family [6] , were shown to be a reliable predictor of relapse in numerous studies [7] . Additionally, relatives are often the primary caregivers of patients with psychosis and are thus generally considered \"important in the process of assessment and engagement in treatment and also in the successful delivery of effective interventions and therapies for people with psychotic disorders\" [4; British NICE guidelines, p. 28]. As a result, attempts were made to positively influence the course of psychotic disorders by improving its management within the patients' families. However, caring for a person with a psychotic disorder is often a heavy burden and relatives face considerable emotional, social, and economical challenges [8] [9] [10] . These stressful conditions are likely not only to affect the well-being of the relatives, but also to limit their long-term ability to support the patient. Therefore, reducing the burden of care and enhancing the wellbeing of carers has become an additional focus of family interventions.",

This enables us to evaluate the comparative efficacy of intervention types that have not yet been directly compared. Due to the inclusion of additional information from indirect comparisons, the efficacy can also be estimated more precisely [27] . Finally, all intervention types can be ranked according to their relative efficacy.
