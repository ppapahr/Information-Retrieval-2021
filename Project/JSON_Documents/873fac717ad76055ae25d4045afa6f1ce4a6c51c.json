Although a number of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, we still lack an understanding of the overall landscape of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in COVID-19 patients. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of BCR repertoires collected over multiple time points during an infection to characterize statistical and dynamical signatures of the Bcell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 patients with different disease severities. Based on principled statistical approaches, we determined differential sequence features of BCRs associated with different disease severity. We identified 34 significantly expanded rare clonal lineages shared among patients as candidates for a specific response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified natural emergence of a BCR with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a number of patients. Overall, our results provide important insights for development of rational therapies and vaccines against COVID-19.",

COVID-19 patients show varying disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to requiring intensive care. While epidemiological and clinical data report that many factors such as age, gender, genetic background, and preexisting conditions are associated with disease severity, host immunity against the virus infection is the crucial component of controlling disease progression (Ellinghaus et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; McKechnie and Blish, 2020; Vabret et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) .

            "text": "Adaptive immunity is considered as one of the core protective mechanisms in humans against infectious diseases. A vast diversity of surface receptors on B-and T-cells enables us to recognize and counter new or repeated invasions from a multitude of pathogens (Janeway et al., 2005; Nielsen and Boyd, 2018) . In particular, antibodies produced by B-cells can provide long-lasting protection against specific pathogens through neutralization or other antibody-mediated immune mechanisms (Janeway et al., 2005) . During the early phase of an infection, antigens of a pathogen are recognized by a group of na\u00efve B-cells, which then undergo affinity maturation in a germinal center through somatic hypermutation and selection. The B-cell receptors (BCRs) of mature B-cells can strongly react to infecting antigens, resulting in B-cell stimulation, clonal expansion, and ultimately secretion of high affinity antibodies in the blood (Burnet, 1959; Burnet, 1960; Cyster and Allen, 2019) . The specificity of a BCR is determined by a number of features such as V-, (D-) or J-gene usage, length and sequence composition of the HCDR3 region. It has been found that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies can be detected in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients starting from the first week after the onset of symptoms . These antibodies bind to different antigens including spike protein and nucleoprotein as well as other structural or non-structural proteins (Hachim et al., 2020) .

A few studies have performed BCR repertoire sequencing to characterize the statistical signatures of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (Galson et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Schulthei\u00df et al., 2020) . However, these studies have limited data on the dynamics of BCR repertoires, which could otherwise provide significant insight into specific responses to the infection. In this study, we have established a principled statistical approach to study the statistics and dynamics of BCR repertoires and to characterize the immune responses in 19 COVID-19 patients with different disease severities. Importantly, by combining information from the statistics of sequence features in BCR repertoires, the expanding dynamics of clonal lineages during infection, and sharing of BCRs among COVID-19 patients, we identified 34 clonal lineages that are potential candidates for a response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified cross-reactive responses to SARS-CoV in some of the COVID-19 patients and a natural emergence of a previously isolated SARS-reactive antibody (Pinto et al., 2020) in three patients.",

Since sequence features of immune receptors (e.g. HCDR3 length, V-or J-gene usage, and insertion/deletion patterns) are often associated with their binding specificity, we used statistical methods to compare these features both at the level of clonal lineages, including the inferred receptor sequence of lineage progenitors (Figs. 2, S2), and unique sequences (Figs. S1, S2) in a repertoire. Lineage progenitors of IgG repertoires are closest to the ensemble of na\u00efve receptors in the periphery. Features of lineage progenitors reflect receptor characteristics that are necessary for activating and forming a clonal lineage in response to an infection. Statistics of unique sequences in a repertoire, on the other hand, contain information about the size of the circulating lineages. Importantly, these two statistical ensembles are relatively robust to PCR amplification biases that directly impact read abundances (see Methods for error correction and processing of sequence reads).",

We found that the variation in V-gene usage among individuals within each cohort was far larger than differences among cohorts ( Fig. 2A) . Data from unique sequences also indicated large background amplitudes due to vast differences in the sizes of lineages within a repertoire (Fig. S1) .

Importantly, HCDR3 is highly variable in its sequence content and length due to insertion and deletion of sequence fragments at the VD and DJ junctions of the germline receptor. Therefore, differential characteristics of the HCDR3 sequence in BCR repertoires of different cohorts can signal preferences for sequence features specific to a class of antigens. We find that HCDR3s in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe symptoms are significantly longer than in the healthy control, both at the level of clonal lineages (Fig. 2B ) and unique sequences in each repertoire (Fig. S1B) . The difference between HCDR3s length in healthy individuals and patients with mild symptoms is insignificant (p-values for significance of these deviations are given in the corresponding Figure  captions ). Recent studies have also identified propensity for longer HCDR3s in BCR repertoires of COVID-19 patients (Galson et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Schulthei\u00df et al., 2020) . We find that the longer HCDR3 length in patients with moderate and severe symptoms is primarily due to insertion of larger sequence fragments and also shorter deletions at the VD junction (Figs. 2C-D, S1C-D). Interestingly, the insertion/deletion patterns at the DJ junctions did not show a substantial difference across cohorts ( Fig. S2C -F).",

Quantifying sequence diversity of a B-cell repertoire, however, is very sensitive to the sampling depth in each individual. Despite progress in the quality of high-throughput repertoire sequencing (RepSeq) techniques, sequenced BCRs still present a highly under-sampled view of the entire repertoire. To characterize the diversity of repertoires and the statistics of sequence features that make up this diversity, we inferred principled models of repertoire generation and selection for the entry of receptors into the periphery (Methods) (Elhanati et al., 2014; Marcou et al., 2018) . To do so, we first used data from unproductive B-cell receptors to infer the highly non-uniform baseline model that characterizes the probability gen (\u03c3) to generate a given receptor sequence (Elhanati et al., 2014; Marcou et al., 2018) (Fig. 1 and Methods). This baseline model reflects sequence biases in generating BCRs in the bone marrow.",

Moreover, we estimated the diversity of the repertoires in each cohort by evaluating the entropy of receptor sequences generated by the respective repertoire models (see Methods). In particular, diverse repertoires that contain B-cell lineages with rare receptors (i.e., those with a lower post (\u03c3)), should have larger entropies. Based on this analysis, we find that immune repertoires are more diverse in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals ( Fig. 3A and Methods). Specifically, the entropy (i.e., diversity) of BCR repertoires grew with severity of the disease, from 38.7 bits in the healthy cohort to 40.5 bits in the mild cohort, to 41.6 bits in the moderate cohort, and to 41.3 bits in the severe cohort (see Methods).",

However, we find a weaker correlation for selection factors associated with preference for HCDR3 length between healthy individuals and the cohorts of COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3B) , which is consistent with our observation in Fig. 2B . Moreover, there are only weak correlations for HCDR3 amino acid preferences between healthy individuals and the cohorts of COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3B) . Interestingly, the HCDR3 composition was most distinct between patients with moderate symptoms and the healthy cohort, with 73% correlation for length and 65% correlation for amino acid preferences (Fig. 3B ).

The binding level (measured by OD450 in ELISA assays) of both IgM and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 increased in most of the COVID-19 patients in our study over the course of their infection (Figs. 4A, S3). We expected that the increase of OD450 binding level is associated with activation of specific B-cells, resulting in an increase in mRNA production of the corresponding BCRs. Detecting expansion of specific clonal lineages is challenging due to subsampling of the repertoires. In fact, only a limited overlap of BCR lineages was found if we simply compared the data between different time points or between replicates of a repertoire sampled at the same time point (Fig. S4 ). To identify expanding clonal lineages, we examined lineages only in patients whose plasma showed an increase in binding level (OD450) to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and compared the sequence abundance of those lineages that appear in two or more time points (Figs. 4A, S3 and Methods). Using a hypothesis test with a false discovery rate of 7.5%, as determined by analyzing replicate data (Methods, Fig. S5 ), we detected significant expansion of clonal lineages within all investigated patients. The results reflect a dynamic repertoire in all patients, ranging from 5% to 15% of lineages with significant expansion and large changes in sequence abundances over time (Figs. 4, S6) . The expanding lineages had comparable HCDR3 length to the rest of the repertoire in COVID-19 patients (Fig. S6 ). Moreover, we observed expanding lineages to show V-gene preferences comparable to those of previously identified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (RBD). This includes the abundance of IGHV4-59, IGHV4-39, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-53, IGH3-66, IGHV2-5, and IGHV2-70 (Brouwer et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020) . However, it should be noted that these preferences in V-gene usage among expanding lineages are comparable to the overall biases in V-gene usage within patients, and expanded lineages roughly make up 25% of lineages with a given V gene (Fig. 4C ). Therefore, Our results suggest that the overall response to SARS-CoV-2 is not driven by only a specific class of IGHV gene.",

Previous work has also identified sharing of BCRs among COVID-19 patients, which was interpreted by the authors as evidence for large-scale convergence of immune responses (Galson et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Schulthei\u00df et al., 2020) . Although BCR sharing can be due to convergent response to common antigens, it can also arise from convergent recombination leading to the same receptor sequence (Elhanati et al., 2018; Pogorelyy et al., 2018a) or simply from experimental biases. Therefore, it is imperative to formulate a null statistical model to identify the outliers among shared BCRs as candidates for common responses to antigens. Convergent recombination defines a null expectation for the amount of sharing within a cohort based on only the underlying biases for receptor generation within a repertoire (Elhanati et al., 2018; Pogorelyy et al., 2018a) (Methods) . Intuitively, sharing is more likely among commonly generated receptors (i.e., with a high post (\u03c3)) and within cohorts with larger sampling (Methods). Importantly, rare receptors (i.e., with a low post (\u03c3)) that are shared among individuals in a common disease group can signal commonality in function and a response to a common antigen, as previously observed for TCRs in response to a yellow fever vaccine (Pogorelyy et al., 2018b) , CMV and diabetes (Pogorelyy et al., 2018a) . We used the receptors' probabilities post (\u03c3) to assess the significance of sharing by identifying a probabilistic threshold to limit the shared outliers both among the COVID-19 patients (dashed line in Fig. 5 ) and the healthy individuals (dashed line in Fig. S7 ). Out of a total of 33,660 (unique) progenitors of clonal lineages (Fig. 5A) , we found 5,112 progenitors to be shared among at least two individuals; 152 of the 5,112 were classified as rare, having a probability of occurrence below the indicated threshold (dashed line) in Fig. 5B . Moreover, we found that 439 lineages shared a common sequence ancestor in at least two individuals and have expanded in at least one of the individuals ( Fig. 5C -D). 34 of these shared, expanding lineages stemmed from rare na\u00efve progenitors (below the dashed line in Fig. 5B , D). The sharing of these rare expanding BCRs among COVID-19 patients indicates a potentially convergent response to SARS-CoV-2 (Table S3) .",

Such sequence patterns with cysteine pairs in the HCDR3 have been associated with stabilization of the HCDR3 loop by forming disulfide bonds with particular patterns and spacings of the cysteines (Lee et al., 2014; Prabakaran and Chowdhury, 2020) . Disulfide bonds in the HCDR3 can decrease the conformational flexibility of the loop, thus decreasing the entropic cost of binding to improve the affinity of the receptor (Almagro et al., 2012) . The significantly larger fraction of multi-cysteine HCDR3s among the candidate SARS-CoV-2 responsive receptors (p-value = 10 -9 based on binomial sampling) indicates an underlying molecular mechanism for developing a potent response to SARS-CoV-2.",

Moreover, we observed largescale sharing of B-cell receptors among COVID-19 patients, consistent with previous findings in COVID-19 patients (Galson et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Schulthei\u00df et al., 2020) . Sharing of receptors among individuals can signal common immune responses to a pathogen. However, BCR sharing can also be due to convergent recombination leading to the same receptor sequence or other experimental biases that influence statistics of shared sequences. These statistical nuances can substantially sway conclusions drawn from the sharing analysis and, therefore, should be carefully accounted for. Here, we established a null expectation of BCR sharing due to convergent recombination by inferring a model of receptor generation and migration to the periphery and used this null model to identify sequence outliers. Our analysis identified a subset of rare BCRs shared among COVID-19 patients, which appears to signal convergent responses to SARS-CoV-2.",
