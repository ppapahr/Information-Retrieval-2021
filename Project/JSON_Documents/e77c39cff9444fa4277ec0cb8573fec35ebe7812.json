            "text": "This chapter is situated within the disaster risk reduction (DRR) framework that traces matters from preparedness (readiness and prevention), responses (relief) as well as recovery and reformation (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015). The DRR framework also brings to the fore the concept of building back better (BBB) after disasters. Natural disasters, particularly pandemics, remain a huge threat to modern societies and in the context of this work, the tourism industry. The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) is of the view that epidemicprone diseases that include influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, Zika, plague and yellow fever are worrying. These epidemics are \"harbingers of a new era of high-impact, potentially fast-spreading outbreaks that are more frequently detected and increasingly difficult to manage\" (GPMB 2019: 12) . The GPMB further alludes to the fact that poorer countries have suffered and will continue to suffer the most, although all economies remain vulnerable to differing degrees. It is estimated that 10% of the global population suffers from an influenza virus each year (Nickol and Kindrachuk 2019) . During the outbreak of the Ebola from 2014-2016, for example, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone lost an estimated combined $ 2.2 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. Although similar to both SARS and MERS (Backer et al. 2020 ), COVID-19 remains different in terms of its swift spread and the number of deaths experienced. The war on these invisible invaders remains difficult to wage (Alexander 2019) .",

The demographics of those that get infected, their time of recovery or those that die due to pandemics also remain crucial to many economic sectors. In their study on cruise liners in China's Shenzhen Shekou Port, Lui et al. (2020) find that the major consumer group are the elderly and children. The elderly had enough resources, especially money, leisure time and a strong desire to embark on the cruise. Yet, emerging statistics are pointing to more of the elderly persons succumbing to COVID-19 (Glynn 2020; Onder et al. 2020) , an aspect that has the potential to negatively impact the tourism industry.

The taskforce was replaced by the GPMB established in May 2018 by the World Bank and the WHO. The GPMB works independently \"to provide the most frank assessments and recommendations possible\" around the issue of contagious disease outbreaks (GPMB 2019: 4) . In DRR, especially in the case of pandemics, the state of readiness and response determine the extent to which damage can be minimised and at times even avoided. This chapter documents the state of readiness and responses to COVID-19 from selected countries. The work further seeks to determine if there were lessons learnt from past pandemic and epidemic outbreaks, among them the 1918 influenza, the SARS and the MERS. Examining and understanding these measures by identifying their strength and weaknesses is critical in explaining the outcomes that will emerge in the post-COVID-19 era. More important, it will inform good response practices relevant to various public and private enterprises as well as other social responses, particularly as these relate to the Sendai Framework on DRR (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015).",

In Europe, the 1918 influenza epicentre was Spain (Martini et al. 2019) . From there, the influenza spread to France, Great Britain and Italy, severely impacting the military operations during the First World War. From historical records, \"Patient Zero\" for the Spanish Flu was Albert Gitchel, a cook at Camp Funston in Kansas. He started coughing, having a fever and headaches on 4 March 1918. Later in spring, 75% of French troops and more than half of the British troops fell ill. In total, 100,000 soldiers died. The influenza moved to North Africa in May 1918 and then to Bombay in India in June 1918. In China and Australia, the first cases were reported in July 1918. This first phase of the flu was weaker compared to the second phase that erupted in August 1918 in Spain. The strong flu is suspected of having resulted from a mutated strain of the virus. This new virus was carried from the port city of Plymouth in south-western England by ships bound for Freetown in Sierra Leone (Africa) and Boston (USA). The movements of the armies were also linked to spreads from Boston, Freetown and Brest in France. The second wave lasted about 6 weeks spreading from \"North America to Central and South America, from Freetown to West Africa and South Africa in September, and reaching the Horn of Africa in November 1918\" (Martini et al. 2019: E64) . At the end of September 1918, the Spanish flu had covered entire Europe, including Poland and Russia, with Russia spreading it to northern Asia and getting to India in September.",

Eventually, 675,000 deaths were recorded in the USA (Alexander 2019). However, these figures were lower compared to 20 million deaths in the Indian subcontinent. Globally, a figure of 50 million deaths is recorded, meaning 40% of these were from the Indian subcontinent.

In October 1918, stories of entire families and peasant populations, miners and urban residents dying started emerging. However, the illness was said to have been transmitted through the railway lines and incoming ships docking at the Atlantic seaports of Tampico and Veracruz. As the pandemic grew, deaths in 1000 s daily were reported, ultimately reaching an estimated total number of half a million. To fight influenza, in typical modern-day language, \"flatten\" the curve (Strochlic and Champine 2020), the government established sanitary brigades (Alexander 2019) . These were sent to every state, and they \"enacted a series of behavioural protocols through a national education campaign and established prescriptive regulations on public gatherings and personal mobility, especially on trains\" (Alexander 2019: 450) . Unpaved streets were irrigated with water, and air was infused with sulphuric compounds. Daily cleaning of frontage property was also enforced. Officials further targeted ships and trains, including quarantine. Curfews were instituted with modest penalties for the poor.",

Australia then lifted its quarantine measures, and in the austral summer of 1918/1919, the country reported 12,000 new infections. This became the third wave, with New York and Paris experiencing the challenges of this third wave, too (Martini et al. 2019 ). This third wave ended in May 1919 in the developed Northern Hemisphere, although Japan had the third outbreak at the end of 1919, ending in 1920 (Andayi et al. 2019) . Andayi et al. (2019) argue that the impacts of the 1918 influenza have been under-reported and documented in Africa and specifically in Kenya. The authors focus on the coastal region of Kenya and use historical records as part of their methodology. They found that crude mortality rates and healthcare utilisation increased six-and threefold, respectively, in 1918. They also estimated a pandemic mortality rate of 25.3 deaths/1000 people/year. Paskoff and Sattenspiel (2019) also investigate age-based mortality differences from the 1918 influenza. The authors also make reference to literature advocating for nationally aggregated mortality rates. From this angle, it emerges that from a study of 70 countries and regions, different mortality rates emerged. Some examples are shown in Fig. 3 .1. In the Newfoundland island, pregnant mothers were badly affected by the 1918 influenza.",

As a result, the flu strain was determined as H1N1. The H1N1 had an incubation period of 1 to 2 days. On infection, the victims suffered extreme prostration and fever, severe muscle pain, hemoptysis and epistaxis. Temperatures of up to 40 \u00b0C were recorded in some patients (Martini et al. 2019 ). This was accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome with mortality levels of between 60 and 70% (Keeling 2020 Paskoff and Sattenspiel (2019: 1) rapid, at times taking between 12 and 24 hours, with the majority of deaths being among young people in the age cohort 20-40 (Jester et al. 2019) . Young soldiers and pregnant women and premature new-borns were the hardest hit. The mortality curve was rather unusual, as typically, influenza epidemics curves are U-shaped, with most deaths taking place in those that are very young and those that are very old. What is imported to note is that the influenza followed trade routes and shipping lines (Alexander 2019) . Van Wijhe et al. (2018) argue that this kind of influenza signature was puzzling. Woo (2019) adds to the equation of young adults' death by indicating that they may have died from an overreaction of their active immune systems, although this explanation has not been satisfactory. This is so given that teenagers also have very active immune systems.",

There has been good access to autopsy samples, with the reconstitution of the influenza pandemic virus having permitted much understanding of how the pandemic virus differs from other seasonal and pandemic influenza virus strains. However, gaps still exist in knowledge regarding the origin of the virus and the molecular mechanisms (be it host and/or viral) underlying differential pathogenesis in contrast to other influenza viruses.",

Philadelphia (which campaigned against coughing, spitting and sneezing in public) first, and the shortest period of social distancing, recorded 748 deaths per 100,000 people after 24 weeks. This was followed by San Francisco that relaxed social distancing measures and had a second wave of deaths, finally reporting 673 deaths per 100,000 people. New York City began social distancing very early just 11 days before the deaths spiked and recorded 452 deaths per 100,000 people. Lastly, St. Louis, which had strong social distancing interventions recorded 358 deaths per 100,000, and this could have been lower had the city not lapsed and temporarily relaxed the social distancing measures (Strochlic and Champine 2020) . Jester et al. (2019) , however, contend that the actual extent of morbidity and mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic is unknown. This is as a result of lack of laboratories to confirm the disease and also the failure to distinguish influenza from other related respiratory diseases. In addition, epidemiological data sets are incomplete, with influenza not being among the reported diseases. Reporting only caught up later when lots of people had already died.",

The high rate of infection of this critical group was a cause for concern, even in the cases of MERS and Ebola cases. The spread was eventually recorded in a total of 28 countries and territories ( Fig. 3.2) . The highest cases, as indicated earlier, were from China at 5327. This was followed by Hong Kong with 1755. The next three countries and territories were in Taiwan with 346 reported cases, Canada at 251 reported cases and Singapore with 238 recorded cases. These were the countries reporting cases over a hundred. The next country in the rank was Vietnam with 63 cases, with the remainder all reporting 27 or fewer cases. In terms of reported deaths, the top six countries were China (349 deaths), Hong Kong (299), Canada (43), Taiwan (37) and Singapore (33). The other countries reported five or less death cases. South Africa was the only country in Africa affected by the SARS with one case that resulted in death. Cooper (2005) observes that nearly 3 months after SARS outbreak, the Chinese Ministry of Health notified the WHO of 300 cases in Guangdong Province. The numbers eventually rose to 5327 for the country. Expectedly, the Chinese government faced harsh international criticism for not initially and comprehensively reporting the full scale of SARS outbreak to the WHO. From the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) report of July 2004, the first case of SARS was discovered on 16 November 2002 and an official report from the Chinese Ministry of Health was only made in 11 February 2003 (BBC 2004 . In this case, Chan-Yeung and Xu (2003) accuse China of imposing a SARS information blackout. This resulted in the dismissal of both the national health minister of China and the Beijing mayor based on an accusation of poorly handling the situation. Subsequently, China pledged to fully cooperate with the WHO. After 26 March 2003, Beijing immediately put in place stringent control measures such as the isolation and quarantining of infected individuals as well as tracing those who have been in contact with individuals with confirmed infection. This practice resulted in the rapid decline of cases countrywide. Ultimately, the fatality ratio of 7% was realised. Nevertheless, China's record in terms of reporting first case epidemics was tainted, and with each new outbreak from China, the world remains suspicious in terms of accuracy of the reported figures.",

(2007) conclude with a question: \"Should we be ready for the re-emergence of SARS?\" The authors argue that despite huge successes recorded in containing SARS within a short period of time, there remained gaps and areas requiring further attention, including broader understanding of managing similar epidemics. This assertion is informed by the fact that coronaviruses are known to undergo genetic recombination, with the potential to new genotypes and new pandemic outbreaks (Cheng et al. 2007 Cooper (2005: 120) of the presence of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, civets and growing culture of eating exotic mammals in Southern China. This scenario resembled a ticking time bomb for the next global pandemic outbreak, which in the focus of this work was confirmed by COVID-19 in December 2019. Hsieh et al. (2005) focus on SARS incidences in Taiwan. The authors highlight that about 151,270 people were put on quarantine, with 668 cases finally testing positive for SARS-CoV and 181 (27%) of them succumbing to the disease . The initial SARS screening in the country commenced on 14 March 2003 with the pandemic experienced right through to 30 July 2003 . The screening involved potentially infective persons for quick diagnosis and hospitalisation. This assisted in cutting off many potential transition pathways. The full-scale quarantine measures were instituted on 28 April 2003 following \"Patient Zero\" confirmation on 8 March 2003 (20 days later) (Hsieh et al. 2005) . The declaration of full-scale quarantines and the period it took remains important for COVID-19 as a good learning point. Other matters related to hygiene, especially handwashing, and these issues are of interest to COVID-19 relate to hygiene. Fung and Cairncross (2006) review selected studies that sought to determine the effectiveness of handwashing in breaking the transmission pathways of SARS. Their analysis shows that nine out of the ten studies confirmed handwashing with soap as an effective SARS infection management measure. Apparently, this approach is applicable to COVID-19 intervention campaigns as well. In addition to hygiene, the matter of communication is also critical. Bowen and Heath (2007: 73) posit that the SARS epidemic taught the world the need to respond with \"rapid, factual, and honest narratives and an ethical dedication to communicate on behalf of the public interest to prevent the needless spread of disease and loss of life\". In the era of massive social media communication networks, facts on COVID-19 are pivotal.",

Key in the interventions is the rapid identification of the source of their infection and infected individuals and tracking those they could have infected as well. In this mix, hospitals have been identified as key transmission points, as health workers are not aware of the infection or lack the means to effective protective measures. Furthermore, it is important to have the means to diagnose an infection. In the case of MERS in South Korea, there was a lack of early diagnosis of MERS. The aforementioned businessman went from hospital to hospital with symptoms, but the MERS infection was not detected. Then, the testing procedure was long and cumbersome. Lessons from this case resulted in the government enacting a new law after MERS in 2016, permitting laboratories to use unapproved in vitro diagnostic kits in the case of a public health emergency. As will be encountered in this chapter, this law assisted the case of COVID-19 greatly (Kim 2020 ). However, from earlier studies and following the outbreak of MERS, Ng and Tan (2017) maintain their worry on the lack of progress in developing vaccines to counter similar future outbreaks of coronavirus. Despite this, the authors remain positive regarding the progress made in terms of the surveillance and the preparation of possible future outbreaks.",

This brings to fore the elements of DRR starting from preparedness (readiness), disaster striking, response (relief) as well as recovery and reformation. The chapter also seeks to document the lessons for future similar pandemics in order to improve on efficiency in dealing with such. Given the nature of the pandemic, event study methodology, employing the case study approach in some instances, was employed. This is a method used by many authors, including Bimha and Nhamo (2017) and MacKinlay (1997) . To this end, events surrounding COVID-19 were traced since the first announcement by the WHO on 31 December 2019 to the time when the chapter went into publication in June 2020. An effort was made to plot geographical information (GIS) maps on lockdowns and hotspot countries in terms of infections and deaths. Other official publications were also retrieved and included emergency declarations, national disaster declarations, decrees, directives, regulations and daily updates on statistics. The event study methodology was complemented by the document and critical discourse analysis (D&CDA) method (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018; Cooper 2005) . Few countries were purposefully selected, including global powerhouses China and the USA. The findings from the study are now considered in the next section.",

The United Nations goes further to identify pandemics and epidemics among the disasters that require attention. The Sendai Framework remains the overarching platform for globally coordinated disaster risk reduction. The policies and practices for disaster risk reduction and management should be embedded in understanding disaster risk from all dimensions. These dimensions include vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment (Ibid.). Hence, the Sendai Framework presents the foundation for countries and organisations to prepare for disasters such as COVID-19 and any eventualities. What remains clear, however, is that when the disaster strikes, the impacts will be felt differently, at different times across the world. This gives some countries more time to prepare and other lesser time to prepare. The extent of impact from the disaster will also be a function of the already prevailing vulnerability. For example, least developed countries and small island states will, by nature, remain more vulnerable to any major global disasters such as COVID-19. Hence, more vulnerable and poor countries may not be able to deal with pandemics such as COVID-19 without external financial, technical, human resources and other assistance. The New Zealand COVID-19 Alert Systems remains of interest to the world (Table 3 .2). Nkengasong and Mankoula (2020) called upon the African continent to be vigilant to the looming threat of COVID-19. The authors made this call when Egypt reported its first confirmed case on 14 February 2020. Noting the high volumes of air traffic and other modes of transportation of goods and services to and from China into the country, and of course the world over, the authors made a call for an Africa-wide focus to manage the then impending pandemic. Nkengasong and Mankoula (2020: 841) highlight that Africa remained vulnerable due to its weak health systems, poverty and inequality as well as \"inadequate surveillance and laboratory capacity, scarcity of public health human resources, and limited financial means.\" Models on the importation of COVID-19 to the African continent direct from China identified Algeria, Egypt and South Africa as having the highest importation risk given their trade relations. Based on this criterion, countries with moderate risk include Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. The models indicated that the risk would come from Guangdong, Fujian and Beijing. As a measure of preparedness, the African Union Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AUCDC) and WHO, in partnership with member states, established the Africa Taskforce for Coronavirus Preparedness and Response (AFTCOR). The partnership established six linked work streams ( Fig. 3.3) . Despite this effort, what was worrying though is that at the beginning of February 2020, only two countries in Africa had the diagnostic capacity to test for COVID-19. Fortunately, this number increased to more than 40 countries by 25 February 2020 (Ibid.).",

Most notable is that the absence of early confirmed COVID-19 cases in some African may not necessarily have been to no infections. Rather, this could have been due to the limited capacity to roll out massive tests on COVID-19 in various jurisdictions. This concern resulted in the WHO, the African Union and partners convening urgent health ministers' meeting with 55 member states represented. The meeting confirmed a commitment to swiftly act against COVID-19 spread (Nkengasong and Mankoula 2020) . This is when the aforementioned AFTCOR Task force was formed, with an Africa-wide COVID-19 strategy endorsed. The strategy sought to ensure that African countries acted accordingly well before COVID-19 crossed into their jurisdictions.",

Key focus issues in this space include large quantities of personal protective equipment i.e. gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents\" (Ibid.: 842). Nkengasong and Mankoula (2020) ended by raising matters pertaining to the whole government approach, with governments urged to urgently put in place proper quarantine and infection control protocols. Other measures included developing some of the protocols such as social distancing through banning mass gathering and the closure of public facilities and building capacity by training medical staff at major hospitals to be able to handle and deal with individuals or at-risk of COVID-19 infection.",

The foregoing brings one to that old folktale many grandmothers used to tell around the evening fires. The folktale presented the case of a cat, mice, warning bell and a tying string. A key question among the mice was who among them was going to tie the bell around the cat's neck? This had to be so for the entire mice kingdom to be alerted of the movements of the cat and hide on time and be safe and free. No mice did! As a result, the mice kingdom remained in danger to the cat to this generation. Likewise, it took time for the world to impose stringent travel bans and doing business with China (\"the cat\") as this could have resulted in big economic ramifications after the COVID-19 epidemic subsided. Hence, the world remained lukewarm to the pending COVID-19 pandemic emanating from Wuhan, in Hubei, a Province of China. As indicated in Chap. 1, Australia tried it through just sponsoring a resolution for an international independent inquiry into COVID-19 outbreak and paid dearly through a 5-year anti-dumping tariff on its barley by China.",

These help in the determination of appropriate periods of quarantine and the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing (Backer et al. 2020) . However, in the absence of incubation periods, the SARS and MERS coronavirus ranges were used during COVID-19 initial cases. Drawing from a Nkengasong and Mankoula (2020: 842) sample of 88 confirmed COVID-19 cases detected outside Wuhan, the authors estimated the average incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval). This, however, ranged from 2.1 to 11.1 days at 2.5th to 97.5th percentile. The progression of symptoms reported in \"Patient Zero\" in Taiwan was similar to those from China and the US cases. Chen et al. (2020) reported fever on day 5 of illness and dyspnea with mild hypoxemia and radiographical pneumonia on day 9 of illness. As the first case of COVID-19 in Taiwan remained under observation, there was no known effective medical treatment. After quarantine, \"Patient Zero\" remained positive on day 15 and only turned negative on day 17. Jalava (2020) then urged the world to find the exact mechanism of initial transmission events. The SARS-CoV-2 transmission can follow pathways that include either human-to-human or animal-to-human (Amodio et al. 2020) . The WHO also presented COVID-19 scenarios, as reflected in Fig. 3.4 .",

In Singapore, for example, medical teams were given 2 hours to uncover how the patient contracted the coronavirus. They are also supposed to identify the nature of people the patient might have infected. The four quick screening questions the medical teams ask include the following: (1) Did they travel abroad? (2) Do they have a link to one of the five clusters of contagion identified across the city-state? (3) Did they cough on someone in the street? and (4) Who are their friends and family, their social and prayer partners? The contact tracing in Singapore unearthed a group of avid singers who spread the virus to their families, transferred the coronavirus to a gym and then a church. This became the largest concentration of cases in the country. Some of the measures put in place in Singapore included building specialised epidemics clinics and official messaging that encouraged the public to wash their hands and/or sneeze in tissues during flu seasons. There are also freely available and accessible testing facilities and such facilities enabled the country to race against the COVID-19 spread. With a population of about 5.7 million people, Singapore had the capacity to test 2000 people daily. This was in sharp contrast to many countries and bigger states like Washington DC whose public laboratories could process up to 400 samples daily. As for Hong Kong, government workers were ordered to work from home, with many private companies following suite. The schools were closed in January and scheduled to reopen on 31 April 2020 (Beech 2020) . Borders were also tightened. The case of Taiwan is different and interesting in that the territory receives direct flights from Wuhan (Cheng et al. 2020 ). The territory started screening passengers from Wuhan late December 2019 well before China admitted COVID-19 coronavirus was spreading between people (Beech 2020) . Despite this screening, the first case in the territory was reported on 21 January 2020. Similar to Hong Kong, the government response was based on lessons and practices developed during SARS infection period. The National Health Command Centre was key in the response operations. As of 31 January, Taiwan had suspended flights from China against advice from WHO. After detecting COVID-19 coronavirus during the Diamond Princess Cruise ship stopover, text messages were sent to every mobile phone on the (Beech 2020) . The efficient and effective monitoring systems in Hong Kong and Taiwan were built in response to SARS. This was in sharp contrast to the USA that had disbanded its pandemic response unit in 2018 (Beech 2020) . \"Patient Zero\" in Italy was reported on 21 February 2020, with the northern part of the country responding by imposing a lockdown in 11 towns. The affected population attempted to disregard government directives, and the government threatened to imprison residents who broke the rules (Spina et al. 2020) . The case of Italy showed that the epicentre of COVID-19 had shifted from Wuhan to Europe. This realisation served as a global wake-up call that sent European health ministries on a quest to urgently search for COVID-19 prevention measures. While this is commendable, our lived experiences as authors suggest that this could have been late. The COVID-19 horse had bolted out of the stable and the world was on fire.",

Drawing from e-lessons and the history of COVID-19 spread elsewhere, the President clearly stated that South Africa, like all the other countries in the world, was not immune to the rapidly spreading pandemic. The President stated that this was probably the greatest calamity facing South Africa since democracy in 1994. At the time of this statement, South Africa had 61 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Against this background, the President stated expectations of higher cases of infection in the future. While all confirmed cases then were imported from Italy, growth was largely expected from cases of local transmissions. As such, the statement articulated that situation called \"for an extraordinary response; there can be no half measures\" (Republic of South Africa 2020a: 1).

The USA topped the list of both infections and deaths with 1,181,885 infections and 69,079 deaths as of 5 May 2020. This was One possible explanation for the picture regarding infections and deaths for the top 22 countries could be the mobility within the Northern Hemisphere that remains very high as facilitated through thousands of (cheap) flights daily, compared to the southern hemisphere. This is also linked to high volumes of trade with China. Secondly, there is the possibility of countries from the southern hemisphere, especially the African continent having a longer time to prepare for the pandemic with the first case reported a month and a half later in Egypt and being an imported case. As revealed earlier, the African Union Centre for Disease Control prepared the member states for COVID-19 outbreak in partnership with the WHO. Thirdly, other aspects, particularly for Africa, could have been to do with the re-emerging Ebola outbreaks that regularly prepare the countries, especially those in West Africa for epidemics. Fourth, there is evidence of slow reactions from countries such as the USA and Italy. In addition, it seems the Spanish Flu lessons had been forgotten as there were huge impacts in some of the countries caught up in COVID-19 pandemic including Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Spain was the epicentre then and almost became the epicentre during COVID-19.

Indeed this was low in comparison to 5% and 4.1% in China and Italy, respectively. So, what did South (2020) Korea do right? From Kasulis' (2020) account, there were a number of key interventions put in place. The country acted very fast to combat the spread of infection. After the confirmed first case of a Chinese woman on 20 January 2020 and a South Korean businessman who had gone to Wuhan 3 days later, there was a plethora of aggressive measures sought to minimise the spread of infections. More important is that there was thorough and screening of all travellers from Wuhan (Kim 2020 ). However, with 11 cases confirmed by 31 January, anti-Chinese sentiment grew, with over half a million people signing a petition on the Presidential Blue House website calling for a ban on all Chinese travellers (Kasulis 2020) .

Fourth, authorities worked together to precisely document the movement of infected people down to the minute from testimonies, closed-circuit television (CCTVs) and smartphone GPS data (Kim 2020) . The success in testing took advantage of the post-MERS reform and authorised an unlicensed COVID-19 test. Fifth, as from 5 March 2020, the government boosted the distribution of masks to medical staff and the public and banned face masks exports. Sixth, to prevent price-gouging and shortages, all face mask producers were required to report sales volumes. The government supplied 4.5 million masks with each person limited to a maximum of five. The masks were also sold at reduced prices of less than US$1 (Kasulis 2020).",

The recovery pathways were being unveiled from carefully planned phased approaches from lockdowns, although not all countries went on lockdowns. Some countries that had not to go on lockdowns at the time of writing included Madagascar, Sweden and Tanzania. Recovery further included economic stimulus packages, which are a subject of discussion in other chapter seen in this book.

Other measures included the installation of infrared cameras and security staff that checked the temperatures. Workplaces were also disinfected thrice daily, and workers had to wear their face masks all the time.

The levels were accompanied by respective regulations specifying the exact activities that would be allowed at any level. Level 4 also meant that all people had to wear compulsory face masks. However, these did not come without challenges. In South Africa, for example, the government was challenged for banning tobacco and alcohol sales under Level 4 (Steyn and Klopper 2020). European countries warned up to COVID-19 recovery, mainly after witnessing the \"flattening\" of curves in Italy and Spain. Austria and Italy opened shops on 14 April 2020 (BBC 2020). Other recovery activities included schools opening in Denmark, businesses allowed to return in Spain and Poland gradually lifting restrictions. Italy opened bookshops and clothes stores for young children, although bookshops were not permitted to open in Lombardy. There was also further use of thermo-scanning and screening robots in certain retail and other establishments. Austria was the second country in Europe to follow Italy's strict lockdowns. On return to normalcy, the country allowed shops of 400m 2 to open alongside hardware and garden centres. People had to wear compulsory facemasks. Germany was due to allow schools and all shops to open in May as well as restart their top-flight football league the Bundesliga (AFP 2020).

From the South Africa Government, new institutions and special vehicles to manage the pandemic were instituted including the Presidential Command Council, Inter-Ministerial Committee on COVID-19 and the Solidarity Fund. Several Decrees were raised in Italy too. Lockdowns became common sites, and these were instituted in several counties under review, with the army deployed to support the police in maintaining law and order. In terms of quick response, Rwanda remains the pathfinder, having instituted its first set of measures after \"Patient Zero\" within a day and only 7 days to lockdown. Everything was done in 8 days, with the lockdown becoming effective the day it was announced. South Korea provided a good example in terms of free testing, contact tracing, distribution of face masks and controlling their prices. Citizen activism was also great, with reforms in law following the MERS assisting inefficiencies in the government systems. In addition, intervention measures should be in place long enough to avoid a recurring of infections, which was a huge worry for Wuhan. A raft of regulations were promulgated to institute travel bans from the air, land and sea as well as to protect consumers from price spikes and manipulations. While some countries declared the COVID-19 as state of emergencies, many others opted to declare the pandemic a state of national disaster. All these were done using applicable legislation, especially disaster management acts. There was also a huge challenge in the manner in which China handled the first cases as it delayed notifying the World Health Organisation (WHO). This was not the first time China did it, having done so during the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003. What became clear is that should similar pandemics happen, the source country must notify the WHO early so that the disease outbreak can be managed quickly and possibly contain early. COVID-19 also brought insights into the manner in which the epicentres migrated. It was first China (Asia), then Italy (Europe), the USA (North America) and South Africa (Africa).",

Many of these measures were from experiences with past pandemic outbreaks and including social distancing, testing with self-isolation and regulatory quarantines, wearing of masks and lockdowns. Social distancing is an intervention measure from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic when the New York City Department of Health enforced such, with other complementary measures. This resulted in the mega-city registering the lowest death rate. The road to COVID-19 recovery enhanced through the gradual and staged phasing out of lockdown and other restrictions. These measures were put in place from across the world from Austria, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and South Africa. Australia, for example, put in place the roadmap to a COVIDSafe Australia with three stages, New Zealand had a COVID-19 Alert System covering all the stages from preparedness, through response and then recovery. South Africa had a five-stage COVID-19 Response and Recovery Plan. Although there was still talk on the extent of COVID-19 in Africa, particularly, the low infections, early indications were that the pandemic had not manifested itself in a manner it did in other areas, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.

The success stories embedded in SARS and MERS history for South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong means every nation should take the COVID-19 as a learning platform to better prepare for the future. In addition, there was inconclusive evidence in terms of the effectiveness of lockdowns. The cases of countries like Sweden, Tanzania and Madagascar, among others, need to be revisited and documented further. However, from the historical experience of the 1918 influenza, US states that had shorter lockdowns experienced more cases and deaths compared to those that had longer lockdowns showing the effectiveness of lockdowns in controlling the pandemic.

The SARS was recognised as a new disease in Asia in mid-February 2003, although it had started spreading from November 2002 from Guangdong Province in China. From November 2002 to July 2003, there were over 8090 cases recorded, resulting in 774 deaths in 29 countries and regions. The deaths were also reported on five continents. The most affected country was China, with more than 75% of the cases (Wilder-Smith 2006). Cheng et al. (2007) warn that the SARS coronavirus was an agent of emerging and reemerging infection. The first SARS case was detected in Southern China in November 2002 and was exported to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003 (Cherry 2004). Only in March 2003 was a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) found to be the causative agent. The viral infection spread to 28 other countries and regions within 11 weeks from 21 February 2003. Cherry summarises the spread of SARS as:The mini pandemic peaked during the last week of May 2003, and the last new probable case was on 13 July 2003. There were a total of 8,096 probable cases and 774 deaths. Sixtysix per cent of the cases occurred in China, 22% in Hong Kong, 4% in Taiwan and 3% in both Singapore and Canada.
