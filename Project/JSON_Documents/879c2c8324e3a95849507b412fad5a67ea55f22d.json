This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 5 early warning scores based on the admission data of critical COVID-19 patients. Methods: Overall, medical records of 319 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission were used for calculating the Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2), Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). Data on the outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for overall and subgroup analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, HEWS, and MEWS in predicting mortality were 0.841 (95% CI: 0.765-0.916), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.821 (95% CI: 0.748-0.895), and 0.670 (95% CI: 0.573-0.767), respectively. Conclusions: SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, and HEWS demonstrated moderate discriminatory power and, there-",

            "text": "T he 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered following an unexplained viral pneumonia case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020. Although most patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 only suffered cold-like symptoms and recovered without special therapy, 1 a few patients became dangerously ill. 2 Previous reports described a mortality rate of 11% to 62% among severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19. [3] [4] [5] [6] The mortality inpatients aged \u226565 y was higher than that in younger patients. 2 Hitherto, identifying patients with life-threatening illness and enabling them to access early advanced medical intervention may contribute to reducing mortality. Due to the large number of patients with COVID-19 and relatively insufficient medical resources, emergency screening of such patients has become challenging. 7 Currently, although clinicians use indices such as the white blood cell count, 1 C-reactive protein concentration, 1 interleukin, 1 or d-dimer 6 to classify COVID-19 cases for severity, these prognostic factors are nonspecific and may involve a delay. Therefore, these indicators were unsuitable for screening, and there is no particular scoring system created for COVID-19 patients. Thus, the second-best choice is applying existing scoring tools. We focused on existing early warning scores (EWSs) to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The EWSs were widely applied in the emergency department (ED) for assisting emergency physicians to predict the risk of deterioration, monitor the evolution of the patient, and make clinical decisions, specifically to promote the safety of the critical patient. So far, many models of EWSs have been developed, such as National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS) (see Supplemental Table 1 , which is available online). In 2012, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) proposed NEWS, 8 whose parameters included heart rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, and mental status. NEWS has now undergone extensive validation. 9,10 Five years later, the RCP updated NEWS to NEWS2, 11 which used the same parameters but altered their weights. HEWS, whose parameters are also the same as those of NEWS but with different weights, was developed in 2015, has successfully completed pilot-testing in the ED setting, [12] [13] [14] and is being used in some medical centers in Canada. MEWS was originally developed in 2000 to facilitate timely recognition of patients with established or impending critical illness. 15 Its parameters are heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and mental status. Some studies [16] [17] [18] have suggested that MEWS may be suitable for use in the ED and may allow improvement in the quality and safety of care. SEWS was proposed by Paterson's team 19 in 2006. Its parameters are respiratory rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and mental status. Paterson et al. illuminated that SEWS correlates with in-hospital mortality. 19 Currently, the EWS series is widely used in EDs. 20 Although some studies 21-23 on clinical therapies for severely ill COVID-19 patients have used EWSs as tools to stratify risk, to our knowledge, no studies comparing the performance of these scores in COVID-19 patients. Thus, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the use of these EWSs as in-hospital mortality indicators for COVID-19 patients.",

The comparison of continuous variables used Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test, and that of categorical variables used the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the capacities of the 5 scoring systems to predict mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. An AUC > 0.75 was regarded as indicating a test of acceptable clinical value and an AUC > 0.97 as a test of high clinical value. 24 The AUCs were compared using the DeLong test, 25 and the best demarcation point of each scoring scale was determined as the maximum value of the Youden index. Then, the corresponding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) corresponding to the best cutoff point of each score were calculated. Finally, we calculated the worst Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score during the first 24 h. And we analyzed the correlation between the worst SOFA score and each EWS through Spearman's rank correlation test.

Although the sudden death after discharge would not be predicted, as no report on sudden death of COVID-19 patients after discharge was found, we inferred that sudden death of COVID-19 patients after discharge is rare. Thus, we considered in-hospital mortality can be used for evaluating the performance of EWSs of identifying severely ill patients to promote the allocation of appropriate medical resources in hospital. In addition, we also used the worst SOFA as the secondary outcome. Nevertheless, further prospective studies of survival analysis could be done for COVID-19 patients.",

Although the SpO 2 measurement at this time is usually on room air or after a short time of oxygen supplying, we cannot confirm that the SpO 2 values of all patients are measured without oxygen supply due to a retrospective study design. Thus, the prospective study with well-designed should be done to control the condition during SpO 2 measurement. Third, due to the lack of COVID-19 patients with hypercapnia, our study was unable to distinguish the performance of NEWS and NEWS2. Because the difference between them is that the oxygen saturation scale of NEWS is uniform for all patients, while that of NEWS2 distinguishes patients with hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency.
