Its high infectivity has contributed to an epidemic spreading to all parts of China and over 100 countries outside China (4). On January 21, 2019, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China defined 2019-nCoV pneumonia as a Class B Notifiable Infectious Diseases to be prevented and controlled by first-level response to major public health emergency. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On February 11, 2020, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Virus (ICTV) officially named the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while WHO named the disease SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 . On March 11, 2020 , the WHO announced that COVID-19 outbreak has escalated to a pandemic scale.",

To address the pediatric specific concerns, the Chinese Pediatric Society (CPS) has initiated a nationwide survey to systematically collect epidemiological and clinical data of pediatric COVID-19. Together with the Editorial Board of the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics, CPS also summoned a multidisciplinary group of experts to put forward recommendations for COVID-19 in pediatrics (7, 8) , based on analyzing these data plus experience gained from management of both pediatric and adult cases.

In contrast, zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the current novel SARS-CoV-2 are opportunistic leading to unexpected outbreaks, with severe pneumonia and even fatality (11, 12) . Autopsy and biopsies from adult COVID-19 patients (13) demonstrated SARS-COV-2 RNA and antigen in type II pneumocytes as compatible with in vitro findings demonstrating its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter relevant cell lines. Whether and how opportunistic CoV become endemic is not yet understood, but mutations allowing selection of more adaptive variants capable of surviving better with a human host is one key conceptual mechanism. Ongoing molecular virological studies have already documented SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutants/variants in patients from China (14) .",

The suggested correlation of viral semiquantitation (Ct value) to viable virus isolation (26) is particularly important if proven dependable, as it offers non-culture option of determining which SARS-CoV-2-positive individual is a potential spreader of COVID-19 for more evidence-based infection prevention and control (27, 28) . Analysis of epidemiological data have all pointed that children are not key primary spreaders of COVID-19 even within family clusters (29) (30) (31) , which has fueled active debates and also suggestions on how school and daycare centers for children and adolescents should be reopened (32, 33) following the closures during the epidemic.",

He further deteriorated and evolved to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), circulatory shock, and acute renal failure (ARF). Chest radiology revealed massive consolidation with ground-glass changes predominately over the right lung. After support by mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), he was extubated after 9 days and discharged 17 days after admission (41) . The second one was an 8month-old infant previously operated for congenital heart disease at 1+ months old (ventilated postoperatively for 1.5 months) and suffered from moderate malnutrition. He presented with cough for 6 days then dyspnea for 1 day. He was mechanically ventilated upon admission and successfully extubated 13 days later and eventually discharged 45 days after admission (54) .

SARS-nCoV-2-specific antibody-dependent tests 1) Serological response could be determined in sera and crucial for confirmation of COVID-19 especially in asymptomatic (silent) patients and those diagnosed by clinical criteria without NAAT positivity. It also enables larger-scale epidemiological studies, screening, and detection of pediatric COVID-19 cases, which are typically mild. More serological tests have been available and used in various reports (72, 73) . Similar to the standard diagnostic protocol of SARS-CoV (74), paired serum from acute and recovery phases should be tested for specific antibody titers. Seropositive conversion or greater than or equal to 4-fold elevation in antibody titers can help to retrospectively confirm the diagnosis. Sera-specific antibody-based tests will empower the confirmation of asymptomatic, epidemiological profiling, and detection of pediatric COVID-19 cases (75) . As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, theoretically specific immunity should be absent in unexposed population, and any suspected COVID-19 case found to have a single seropositive sample may be deemed diagnostic. Further investigation on recovery samples to measure the change in titers may strengthen and reaffirm such notion. Of note is that cross-reactivity of less specific antibodies capable of recognizing both SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 has actually been a demonstrated issue but could not be totally ignored when working up subjects with unknown infection (76) . Given that SARS-CoV infection was not endemic, this should not be a major issue. 2) Direct viral antigen detection by specific antibodies performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate and other tissues is another standard diagnostic approach. No clinical study has yet been reported for SARS-CoV-2 using such laboratory tests.",

By mid-February 2020, in view of reported false-negative results (70) and interim limited capacity of NAAT test availability in areas where demands were overwhelming, the NHC included a clinical COVID-19 diagnostic category (ONLY for February 9th to 24th) based on positive epidemiological history plus clinical manifestations plus relevant chest radiological changes with no (or pending) virological confirmation. However, as mild pediatric COVID-19 mainly exhibits minimal, localized, and atypical lung radiological changes (63) not distinguishable from those encountered in simple viral pneumonia especially during the flu season, such clinical category had not been adopted for pediatric COVID-10 care beyond Hubei Province for the specified period.",

Cases with heightened infectivity should be cared in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). The health care providers must be equipped according to tertiary protection standard. All biological secretion and excretion from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be handled according to disinfection guidelines (5, 6, 42, 85) . b. Patients in the community: Condition on available local community health service (ad hoc or conventional), the choice of home isolation, and surveillance for a COVID-19 child should be made by the pediatrician in-charge based on the following understandings: his/her parents (or the designated guardians) will accompany the child the whole time; in addition, appropriate community supervising system and tele-medicine guidance pathways are in place and feasible. Specimens for confirmatory diagnostic tests, if deemed appropriate (e.g., deep throat saliva could be self-collected at home), could be sent to, or collected at, designated sites (5, 6, 8, 42, 85) . c. Infants born to a mother with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: Each baby should be immediately separated from his/her mother after delivery and admitted into an isolation room for monitoring. Primary infection prevention should be adopted. Meanwhile, breastfeeding is advised to be temporarily withheld with the mother expressing milk to maintain production for continuing breastfeeding later. Indeed, positive identification of SARS-COV-2 RNA in breast milk had been reported in Italy and Germany recently (86, 87) , supporting such notion. It is prudent therefore to check breast milk for NAAT negativity before resuming breastfeeding. Direct breast feeding and nursing by SARS-COV-2-positive mother should be deferred until the mother has viral shedding clearance documented. While continual deliberations have been raised as to whether direct contact between nursing mother and her newborn baby should be preferred in the interest of promoting maternal-child developmental health and bonding, the threat of getting moderate/severe COVID-19 is not negligible. The fact that both babies in the Ulm UMC report (87) were infected and became symptomatic (one with hypoxemia) does lend support to the current guideline of separating babies from the mothers.",

Trials of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), ribavirin, chloroquine, and arbidol treatment have all been proposed for compassionate use according to the Chinese NHC \"Diagnosis and treatment plan of pneumonia with new coronavirus infection (trial version 7)\" (7) . These therapeutic options should be judiciously chosen, generally only for severe or critical cases and preferably only tried/used with informed consent (6) . It is prudent for principles outlined in WHO Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions Framework (MEURI) (92) to be adopted in choosing a specific agent by the clinical team, with emphasis on structured collection of relevant clinical data for analysis as clinical trials. Along this line, the \"Guidance: multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19\" issued by the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health does illustrate how such proactive approach in dealing with evolving clinical problems is emphasized in the current COVID-19 pandemic (93) . The second critical COVID-19 child received LPV/RTV for 7 days (started on day 13 and day 6 after onset and admission). His fever subsided after 6 days and was successfully extubated after 7 days; however, his respiratory aspirate remained positive for SARS-nCoV-2 at that time. During therapy, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and lactate levels were normal, whereas significantly decreased WBC count and transient thrombocytopenia were observed 3 days after starting LPV/RTV treatment. The leukocytopenia was corrected after a dose of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (54) .",

Through their multicenter clinical studies, chloroquine treatment is demonstrated to be superior than non-chloroquine control by promoting a higher rate of subsidence of fever, alleviating lung pathological changes, decreasing the rate of progression to severe COVID disease, shortening the time for SARS-nCoV-2 nucleic acid positivity converting to negative, and decreasing the overall rate of SARS-nCoV-2 nucleic acid positivity (95) . One observational study conducted in New York did not demonstrate either a greatly lower or an increased risk of the defined end point of intubation and death in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (96) . US FDA has issued a review of safety issues with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which identified reports that included serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure. Hence, it has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine outside the hospital setting or a clinical trial based on the risk of cardia arrhythmia (97) .",

This has led to additional key issues being identified, not otherwise covered by the current guideline based mainly on the Chinese experience. An interesting report from Rome, Italy, documented a neonate born to a mother with COVID-19 infection and positive blood SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody on PND1, but his nasopharyngeal swab NAAT only turned positive by PND14 (negative on both PND1 and 3) (86). He remained asymptomatic. Whether the presence of maternal SARS-CoV-2 had protected him from turning symptomatic remained to be speculative. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 had been identified in the breast milk (actually the first report in medical literature) in the early postnatal days. In this report, abstinence of breastfeeding until the maternal COVID-19 infectious status cleared was practiced, in agreement with our recommendation. In order not to deprive these newborn babies of the crucial benefits of breastmilk feeding, donor breast milk, or those from the milk bank could be considered (115) . Furthermore, elaborate longterm follow-up protocol up to 1 year of age has been proposed for those newborn babies with established COVID-19, which is worth following in order to fully delineate the clinical impact of COVID-19. Meanwhile, how best should newborn babies of confirmed pregnant mothers be managed will continue to be refined with more experiences cumulated worldwide.",

Despite there are yet no definitive treatment(s) proven by clinical trials to cure these coronaviral diseases, anecdotal experiences and basic scientific studies from SARS and MERS outbreaks have lined up leading agents and thoughts adopted by critical care clinicians. A few tangible antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments were being used in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, with mixed claims of effectiveness.

For example, serious side effects previously reported in adult SARS patients from high-dose steroid usage were not experienced by the pediatric counterparts, while beneficial effects were apparent (122) . Getting to better delineate what pediatric COVID-19 is like will set the stage to establishing informed management approach, allowing stakeholders to identify targeted agenda to explore for plausible differential treatments fit for our developing kids.",

Target genes are usually RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), E (envelope), and N (nucleocapsid). These tests should be conducted in a P2 health laboratory with operators stringently observing tertiary protection (5-7), but new products potentially suitable for use as points of care tests are emerging. 1) Sample collection: respiratory specimens is most favorable, including upper respiratory tract (URT) like nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab and low respiratory tract (LRT) like sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Deep throat saliva is another proven source(20). For strongly suspected cases, a single URT negative test cannot exclude COVID-19(5,6,8).Additional LRT sampling or repeating another URT is recommended. Induction of sputum should be avoided to minimize the risk of airborne transmission(6,8). Tertiary protection with contact and airborne precautions should be strictly implemented to avoid virus transmitted by droplets from URT or aerosol from LRT (5, 6, 8).1.1 For a collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, a synthetic fiber swab with its plastic shaft should be inserted into the nostril parallel to the palate. Pharyngeal swabbing may provoke vomiting, anal swabbing can induce defecation, and both could create hidden environmental contamination and expose healthcare/laboratory workers to profound yet preventable risk. For uncooperative patients, it is prudent to assess whether such sampling is indispensable before committing to doing so(6). It is advisable for workers to conduct these procedures in full PPE. Other specimens such as blood (lower positive rate than respiratory secretions), stool, and urine may be collected, but their diagnostic values should be evaluated prospectively given that relevant information has not been complete(70). 1.2 For children old enough to clear saliva from deep throat and spit it into the sample collection bottle, detailed instructions on how to do so are available (71).",

With reporting of multisystemic inflammatory syndrome range of clinical problems in countries outside China, IVIG could well be indicated for confirmed COVID-19 patients with related symptoms, regardless of whether casually triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or not. Therapeutic use of IVIG has been recommended for critical pediatric infection at clinician's discretion (6). 6) Optimal empiric antimicrobials: Antibiotics should only be used when a coinfection is highly suspected or established by comprehensive microbiological evaluation. Antimicrobial prescription without a conscientious rationale should be avoided. One should ensure its dosing is pediatric appropriate and usage adjusted in accordance to observed clinical response and drug-sensitive test. For patients highly suspected of bacterial coinfection, antibiotics should be initiated immediately while samples be sent for microbiological identification(5,6,8,109). 7) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): Some recipes have been recommended for adult patients and could be considered by pediatricians who command reasonable knowledge of the respective benefits vs. potential risks or side effects",

Detection and reporting For patients meeting the criteria to be evaluated for COVID-19, relevant public health ordinance should be followed. These usually translate into activating isolation, prevention, and control measures immediately plus notifying both infection control personnel of respective facility and the local or state health department. If other common respiratory pathogens are undetected, the patient should be sent for SARS-CoV-2 nuclei acid test. COVID-19 may only be excluded by sequential two negative results (with 1 day apart from each other) (5, 6, 8, 42). 2. Medical observation A person with close contact or exposure history should be observed and assessed. Centralized or home isolation may be the solution. Duration of the medical observation may last for 14 days from the last contact with the infection source. Temperature and clinical manifestations are the major indicators for upscaling management algorithm (5, 6, 8, 42). 3. Patient transport Patients should be transported in a specific ambulance/vehicle with appropriate protection to health care providers. The vehicle should be disinfected after the transportation following the standard practice enlisted in \"Transport of Patients with 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia (trial version)\" (111).4. Discontinuation of infection control isolationFulfillment of all the following is recommended for discontinuation of isolation: temperature remains normal (not because of ongoing steroid) for more than 3 days, improvement of respiratory symptoms, resolution of lesion in chest radiology, and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 negative in two successive samples taken more than 1 day apart. The patients may be transferred to a non-isolation ward or discharged home based on clinical judgment(42,58, 61, 112). Discharged patients should continue to observe home isolation and surveillance for at least another 14 days while wearing a mask, dining separately from other household members, and observe strict hand hygiene. They ought to be promptly re-assessed should any new symptom(s) appear. Follow-up for clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically relevant specimens should be advised by pediatrician in-charge.",
