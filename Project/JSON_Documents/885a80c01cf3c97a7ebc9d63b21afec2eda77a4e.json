Addressing wellbeing explicitly within HIV/AIDS policies could assist mitigation efforts. However, guidance on wellbeing measures to evaluate policies for YPLHIV is scarce. The aims of this mixed-methods review were to identify: i) key dimensions of wellbeing and ii) wellbeing measures that align to these dimensions among YPLHIV (15-24 years) in SSA. We searched six social science and medical databases, including grey literature. We included studies that examined correlates and lived experiences of wellbeing, among YPLHIV in SSA, from January 2000 to May 2019. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts and assessed methodological quality of included articles. We analysed quantitative and qualitative data using descriptive and meta-ethnographic approaches, respectively. Thereafter, we integrated findings using a framework approach. We identified 6527 citations. Of these, 10 quantitative and 30 qualitative studies were included. Being male, higher educational status, less stigma and more social support were likely correlates of wellbeing. Themes that shaped experiences suggestive of wellbeing were: 1) acceptance and belonging-stigma, social support; 2) coping; 3) standard of living. Our final synthesis found that the following dimensions potentially characterise wellbeing: self-acceptance, belonging, autonomy; positive relations, environmental mastery, purpose in life. Wellbeing for YPLHIV is multi-dimensional and relational. Relevant measures include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff's Psychological Wellbeing Scale and Mental Health Continuum Short Form. However, psychometric evaluations of these scales among YPLHIV in SSA are needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Adolescence and young adulthood are critical periods for wellbeing, an indicator of the quality of life.

For young people living with HIV (YPLHIV), who because of greater access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), can expect to reach adulthood, building and sustaining wellbeing as they grow older is crucial. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) there are an estimated 2.8 million YPLHIV aged 15-24 years [4] . Many YPLHIV in SSA are at high risk for HIV-related mortality, morbidity [5] and poor quality of life due to the sub-optimal access to treatment and psycho-social services, including exposure to multiple stigmas [6] [7] [8] [9] . According to the United Nations [10] , the number of YPLHIV in Africa is projected to increase by 44% between 2015 and 2030. Models predict that investment in the quality of life among the growing youth population in SSA, particularly via addressing health needs, could increase labour productivity and resultantly accelerate economic growth [11] .

The wellbeing of YPLHIV in SSA is likely to be compromised given the impact HIV/AIDS has on key dimensions of wellbeing such as finding meaning, selfacceptance and maintenance of positive caregiver and peer relationships [16] . Importantly, emerging empirical evidence has shown that YPLHIV in this setting are at high risk for depression and anxiety [17] [18] [19] and suicidal ideation [20] .

There is growing recognition for the need to include quality of life as an HIV/AIDS programme target [32, 33] .

However, monitoring and evaluation frameworks of these programmes do not explicitly include wellbeing as an outcome, a recommended measure in the field of economics for measuring social progress [35] .

This model has a strong PWB orientation and emphasises three key elements: 1. meaning of life (experienced in the connectedness to something larger than life and the realisation of values); 2. meaning in life (experienced in the belongingness and relatedness to other people); and 3. meaning to life (expressed via actions such as expressions of affection, longing for belongingness, building relationships).

We implemented this approach by comparing first and second order constructs across studies that were homogeneous in terms of design elements (setting, population and period of ART rollout) and chronologically ordered studies based on publication date [87] . Subsequently, we matched themes across papers ensuring the third order captured similar themes from various studies. We then tabulated translations by highlighting key third order constructs derived and supporting quotes and narratives.

We evaluated the quality of the qualitative evidence synthesis using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach [88] .

These findings suggest that wellbeing measures that consider domains such religion living standards or dimensions such as purpose in life might be valuable for this population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 192, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 379, "end": 384, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 439, "end": 444, "text": "[100,", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "125,", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "141,", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 455, "end": 459, "text": "142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 552, "end": 557, "text": "[107,", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "122,", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 712, "end": 717, "text": "[103,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "114,", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 723, "end": 727, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, our findings support the use of multidimensional relational wellbeing scales aligned to life domains which are important to YPLHIV (i.e. family, religion, education, living standards). Subjective wellbeing scales that consider these domains include the Personal Wellbeing Index [42] and the Student Life Satisfaction Scale [41] . The Personal Wellbeing Index has been applied in South Africa's national social attitudes survey of individuals aged 16 years and older [143] . The Personal Wellbeing Index has exhibited good scale reliability among adolescents in developing countries [144] whereas the Student Life Satisfaction Scale has shown favourable psychometric properties among children in South Africa [145] . Broader wellbeing scales such as Ryff's PWB scale and the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form have shown strong alignment with themes that emerged in our synthesis (i.e. social support, belonging, purpose in life, self-acceptance). These PWB scales have shown good validity among adolescent populations in the North [146] . In addition, the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form has shown strong alignment with conceptualisation of a good life among adolescents in South Africa [65] . Further studies are needed to validate these wellbeing measures among YPLHIV in SSA, paying careful attention to translational issues [147, 148] . These proposed scales are relatively brief and can be either self-or interviewer-administered in national economic or HIV surveys, including programme evaluations. In addition, key dimensions of wellbeing in this setting (e.g. positive relations, acceptance, coping) could be used as key output measures in monitoring and evaluation frameworks of multi-sectoral HIV policies and programmes to indirectly assess wellbeing impacts. Our findings also highlight the importance of including social support, stigma, gender and living standards as explanatory variables in econometric models examining the wellbeing effects of HIV/AIDS policies among YPLHIV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 332, "end": 336, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 475, "end": 480, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 591, "end": 596, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 717, "end": 722, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1045, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1203, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1345, "text": "[147,", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1350, "text": "148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Key strengths of this review include: 1) use of mixedmethods, with qualitative data used to explain patterns in the quantitative synthesis; 2) use of a search strategy with a comprehensive definition of wellbeing that allowed us to examine wellbeing literature from multiple disciplines; 3) inclusion of both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature; 4) quality appraisal of each included study and quality assessment of the synthesised evidence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This review is subject to the following limitations: 1) key population groups such as LGTBQI, sex workers and injecting drug users were excluded, as their lived experiences are likely to be different given the higher levels of stigma they possibly encounter relative to the general population of YPL-HIV [149] [150] [151] ; 2) several applicable regional conferences lack online abstract and thus our review may have missed potentially relevant material; 3) our review focused only on YPLHIV in SSA and thus findings may not be generalisable to other regions. However, results from recent studies suggest that there are similarities between YPLHIV in SSA and other developing nations within the South-East Asia Region and Region of the Americas in terms of correlates of mental illness [81, 152] and adherence [153, 154] . Hence, results could be relevant to settings with similar disease and socioeconomic profiles. Several gaps in our evidence base were identified. First, no study directly assessed correlates of wellbeing (using a wellbeing scale) or evaluated experiences of subjective or psychological wellbeing. Second, there were no data from Central Africa, with only one study from West Africa. Third, our evidence is not generalisable to YPLHIV in the community given that most studies sampled individuals from healthcare facilities. Fourth, variability in outcome definition and scale choice made it difficult to compare between quantitative studies and did not allow for a meta-analysis. Fifth, the lack of age-stratified data limited our ability to compare correlates and wellbeing by relevant age-bands (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) vs. 20-24 yrs.). Sixth, weaknesses in the study design and analytical techniques used in the quantitative evidence limited out ability to draw out any causal interpretations.

Understanding the wellbeing effects of HIV/AIDS policies could help steer policies in the direction that meets the broader needs of YPLHIV. This review has shown that social support was a key correlate of poor mental health and that social relationships shaped positive lived experiences. In view of the negative association between poor mental health functioning and measures of wellbeing found in the literature, it is plausible to posit that in this population wellbeing is multi-dimensional and that relational dimensions frame wellbeing among YPLHIV. Multi-dimensional wellbeing scales with a strong relational focus that could be applicable for this group include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff's PWB and Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Future studies should go beyond the investigation of mental health and examine wellbeing, based on definitions grounded in theory, to provide more accurate data on the wellbeing effects of policies.

This evidence examined themes that shaped experiences suggestive of wellbeing among YPLHIV in SSA Summary of review finding Theme 1-Social acceptance and belonging 1.1. HIV-related stigma and discrimination Stigma negatively impacted wellbeing by reducing self-acceptance and challenging the ability to maintain positive relationships. Internalised and externalised stigma impeded the ability to derive meaning in and to life and consequently wellbeing. It negatively impacted selfworth, connectedness with others and self-acceptance, particularly among women. Moreover, it challenged the ability to build relationships and reciprocate love and affection. Theme 2-Coping The ability to manage daily lived realities was important for wellbeing. YPLHIV drew on religion and faith to help understand the meaning of life. This may have engendered a sense of control, belongingness and relatedness and thereby brought meaning to and in life. Similarly, goals and aspirations brought meaning and purpose to life.
