However, proper safety precautions have to be put in place to ensure the health of players and officials (and requirements for proper infection protection for all citizens) and the integrity of competition. 3 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2019/20 season of the German first professional football league ('Bundesliga') was interrupted after the match between M\u00f6nchengladbach and Cologne on 11 March 2020. On 17 March the DFB's (German national football association) medical committee made recommendations for home-based training and management of players with suspected COVID-19 disease as well as for training in small groups. Two weeks later the DFL formally appointed the Sports Medicine/Special Match Operations Task Force: four medical doctors, including co-authors of this paper (TM, WK and BG), and two employees each of the DFL (Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga/ German football league) and the DFB.",

This study evaluates the success of the concept based on available objective indicators, that is, symptoms, testing results and development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (seroconversion).

From a more scientific perspective, symptom monitoring can only be used as a rough indicator of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

This led to the addition of IgG antibody testing which can be considered the most comprehensive approach to detect infectious episodes in the past (but not acute ones, of course).",

This occurred in nine individuals, among them four from negative to positive. Besides spontaneous fluctuations of the antibody concentrations, 7 an infection during the weeks before the initial test would be a likely explanation. This would mean that antibody concentrations were still on the rise at the initial testing and reached positive levels at the end of the season. An undetected infection during the season may be regarded as an alternative explanation. However, this must have escaped all PCR tests and not have led to any infection of teammates or opponents as indicated by their negative results throughout. Finally, and most importantly, neutralisation tests which can be regarded as the gold standard for assessing immunity have not confirmed any seroconversion. Therefore, it seems most likely that the cut-off value of the utilised antibody test was set very \"sensitive\" and may have impaired specificity. The relatively small differences in the OD ratio between test time points for all nine sample pairs speaks in favour of this.",

Additionally, we are very grateful to the team doctors of all participating teams who supported the study very well. We thank Sarah Kurz and Maximilian Steinacker (Bioscientia Department Clinical Trials) and the entire staff of Bioscientia Labor Ingelheim for the support of this study. Moreover, many thanks to the different laboratories performing the PCR tests all over Germany. We thank Lisa-Maria Raschbichler and Albert Falch for excellent technical support.Contributors Each author contributed sufficiently to the manuscript to justify authorship. TM, WK and BG were members of the group who designed the hygiene concept. DM, KD and OH were concerned with laboratory determinations in the Bioscientia Laboratory Ingelheim. DvL, JK and AR are working for the virology lab in Innsbruck which conducted the neutralisation tests. All of us were involved in the conceptualisation of the study and writing and proofreading of the manuscript.",
