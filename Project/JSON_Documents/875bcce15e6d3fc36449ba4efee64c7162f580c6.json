One of the major usages of such data is travel time prediction, a typical service provided by GPS navigation devices and apps. Meanwhile, the constant collection and analysis of the individual location data also pose unprecedented privacy threats. We leverage the notion of geo-indistinguishability (GI), an extension of differential privacy to the location privacy setting, and propose a procedure for privacy-preserving travel time prediction without collecting actual individual GPS trace data. We propose new concepts to examine the impact of the GI sanitization on the usefulness of GPS traces, and provide analytical and experimental utility analysis of the privacy-preserving travel time reliability analysis. We also propose new metrics to measure the adversary error in learning individual GPS traces from the collected sanitized data. Our experiment results suggest that the proposed procedure provides travel time analysis with satisfactory accuracy at reasonably small privacy costs.",

While collection and applications of location data provide enormous benefits and convenience to individuals and society, processing of location information can easily expose personal behaviors, interests, social relations, or other private information, especially if combined with other data sources. [1] studies human location movement data of 1.5 million people for 15 months and concludes that as little as four space-time points can uniquely identify 95% individuals. In the COVID-19 pandemic, tracing apps have been used in some countries to collect individual spatiotemporal data to identify and isolate those who came into contact with COVID-19 patients, raising privacy concerns [2] [3] [4] .

Location encryption methods [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] often come with high computational and resource costs [14] . Once decrypted, the data are no longer private, though still safe, to those who have the authority to access and view the data. In other words, the privacy:utility ratio from the data user perspective is either 100:0% or 0:100%, corresponding to the two states of encryption and decryption, respectively. These two extreme ways of providing data access often do not meet the practical needs of data sharing. As a matter of fact, a non-zero small privacy cost is often acceptable so to create more options between the two extremes to release data and share information with more data users.",

These methods focus on privacy-preserving data processing and analysis via methods such as data suppression, removal of identifiers, development of perturbation mechanisms to report dummy locations, among others. If properly implemented at the data collection stage, the true responses of an individual can be made known only to the individual with 100% confidence but no one else. The key in implementing anonymization and obfuscation is to strike a good balance between privacy loss and data utility (the higher the privacy cost, the more data utility there is).",

DP is a ground-breaking and mathematically robust concept for data privacy protection and has quickly become the mainstream in privacy research and applications, including adoption by big tech companies (e.g., Apple, Google, IBM) and government agencies (Census2020) of the classical DP concept or its variants. For location privacy, [20] extends DP to formulate the notion of geo-indistinguishability (GI). GI follows similar mathematical reasoning as DP, and many properties of DP are thus directly applicable to GI such as privacy loss composability [29] , immunity to post processing [30] , being future-proof [30] , and robustness to a wide range of adversary attacks [31, 32] . GI has been ex- Fig. 1 : Privacy Protection Strategies for Analysis using GPS Data plored in a wide range of applications in location privacy protection. For example, [21] extends GI by developing an elastic indistinguishability metric that adapts injected noises according to the area density. [23] proposes a clustering privacy-preserving mechanism for continuous location traces clustering application. [25] applies GI to preserve location information uploaded by passengers in vacant transportation network company vehicles. [26] proposes a GI task allocation mechanism to preserve location privacy in mobile crowd-sensing applications.",

            "text": "We aim to develop a procedure to provide Privacy-Preserving Travel time Prediction with Uncertainty (PP-TPU) using GPS data; a topic hasn't been explored in either research or applications, to the best of our knowledge. Travel time Prediction with Uncertainty (TPU) examines whether and how quickly a person arrives at a destination through a certain means of transportation with a certain level of confidence, and is an important topic for transportation geography, urban planning, among others [33] . It is also a typical route planning service provided by navigation systems or mapping services and apps. TPU depends on collection of users' travel trajectory data by a service provider. Without sufficient privacy protection, such data can pose non-ignorable privacy risks ( Fig. 1(a) ) and it is easy for adversaries, both honest-but-curious (e.g., the service provider itself) and malicious, to infer and disclose users' private behavioral patterns and habits using the collected and released location information [34] . Fig. 1 also displays two strategies that can be used for PP-TPU. The sanitization strategy in Fig. 1(b) focuses on sanitizing aggregated statistics calculated from the actual user data, say via the randomization mechanisms (e.g, Laplace mechanism) by achieving classical DP. This strategy will mitigate the privacy risk due to adversaries learning new information about their targets from the released aggregate information, but it cannot decrease the privacy risk brought by other adversaries who can access the original collected data, such as the service provider itself. Fig. 1(c) illustrates a strategy where the sanitization occurs during data collection. In other words, the true responses are only to known the users themselves, not anyone else. To achieve this, the true individual responses will go through a sanitization mechanism prior to them being shared with the data collector or service provider. Therefore, the strategy in Fig. 1(c) is more robust than that in Fig. 1 (b) from a privacy protection perspective, and it is the strategy behind our proposed procedure for PP-TPU. The conceptual and methodological contributions of the proposed PP-TPU procedure and its potential practical impacts are summarized as follows.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there is no work focusing on PP-TPU analysis. The first step in our proposed PP-TPU procedure is to collect individual travel trajectories with privacy guarantees, on which there exists some work. First, the planar Laplace mechanism [20] can be used to perturb multiple locations from the same individual or trajectory. Due to the sequential composition of privacy costs for GI [20] and DP in general [29] , either the overall privacy cost for releasing an informative yet sanitized trajectory can be unrealistically high if the mechanism is na\u00efvely applied to each GPS record, or the sanitized trajectory is useless if the overall cost is kept reasonable. Our PP-TPU procedure improves the practical feasibility of this approach by imposing a ceiling on the number of collected locations per individual and excluding non-usable sanitized trajectories from a TPU perspective given a target route. [22] proposes concepts \"\u03b4-location set\" and \"sensitivity hull\" to account for temporal correlations in travel trajectories and bound the sanitization error. However, despite aiming at releasing multiple locations per trajectory, the work does not consider the composition in privacy loss in the same individual. [23] designs the clustering GI to aggregate nearby locations into a single perturbed location, which would lead to too much information loss if adopted for TPU. [21] proposes the concepts of privacy mass and elastic distinguishability to adjust the level of noises according to different area densities, offering some interesting ideas to improve the utility of PP-TPU that we plan to investigate in the future.",

It is common that direct projections of GPS coordinates may not correspond to any meaningful real map coordinate, and road mapping algorithms often involve some level of approximation.

It is very possible that not all the GPS records will be mapped to the target route, even if the traveller in fact stays on R all the time at least for the time period of interest, due to a few reasons. First, GPS information is not always accurate due to satellite signal blockage and multi-path effects, causing difficulty in road matching. Second, road mapping procedures themselves often involve approximation and errors. Third, with the additional randomness introduced by the GI sanitization, the location accuracy will further decrease. Therefore, each trajectory may different number of GPS records mapped onto R, some of which are consecutive in times and others are not. When calculating the travel distance on R for a traveller, it makes sense to only count the distances between the locations at two consecutive time points if both are mapped onto R. One way to formulate the weight is to let it be proportional to how much a sanitized mapped trajectory overlaps with the target route.",

The smaller \u03b1 and the larger \u03b4 are for a given d, the more useful the mechanism is in terms of distance preservation. Figs. 3(b) to 3(d) depict the relationship between \u03b1 and \u03b4 when the original distance d is 5, 10, and 20 at different levels of unit-distance privacy cost . As d increases, \u03b4 decreases for the same \u03b1. From the plots, we can claim that there is a 80% probability that the distance d * between the perturbed locations via the planar Laplace mechanism of = 1 GI is \u00b125% of d \u2265 10; in other words, the mechanism is (10, 0.25, 0.2)-useful at = 1.

How to define \"correctly identified positions\" is up to the user. One approach is hard-thresholding. Specifically, we choose a clip radius C. if the sanitized location falls within the circle of radius C centered at the original location, then it is a correct positioning. Certainly, the smaller C is, the harder it is to meet the criterion, but the more meaningful \"correct\" is. Since each location on a trajectory is perturbed independently via the polar Laplace mechanism, with the hard-thresholding rule, the probability of correctly identifying a location can be determined analytically, which is p = F (C; 2, /n), where n is the number of recorded positions on a GPS trajectory and F is the CDF of gamma(2, /n). The number of correctly identified positions m given p follows a binomial distribution m \u223c Binom(n, p). As for the distribution of CPD l, we can leverage Binom(n, p) to express p(l) analytically when n is small, but p(l) for 1 \u2264 l < n \u2212 k with small k \u2265 0 becomes less tractable as n increases considering that a trajectory may contain multiple location strings of different l. For example, a GPS trace with n = 10 records may have 2 occurrences of 1 = 1, 1 occurrence of l = 2, and 1 occurrence of l = 3. When the analytical work becomes difficult, we may resort to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to calculate p(l), as presented in Algorithm 2. Though the algorithm is presented with the hardthresholding rule to define correct positioning, the steps are applicable to other ways of defining correct positioning by updating line 4 of the algorithm. n ",

Since Experiment 1 has a single road, the mappings of all the GPS coordinates land on the target route; in the other 3 experiments, a GPS record can land anywhere on the road network per the shorted path algorithm employed. We set the maximum number of GPS records at 10 per trajectory. Specifically, if a traveller had \u2264 10 records, we used all of them; if a traveller had > 10 records, we randomly sampled 10 records or had 10 records spaced equally over the trajectory if there were enough records to allow that. For the GI sanitization, we set the per-location per-meter privacy loss at 0.005, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.08 in all 4 experiments. Since the maximum of GPS records is 10, the total privacy cost for releasing a trajectory is \u2264 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, respectively. The PP-TPU analysis was then conducted via algorithm 1 in each experiment. ample. The original GPS records from the traveller in the leftmost plot are all mapped onto the target road. Though each sanitized GPS location deviates from the original, the shorted path mapping algorithm still projects all of them onto the target road, which are used for the subsequent PP-TPU analysis. For the middle traveller, all the original GPS records of the traveller are mapped onto the target road, but 2 out of 10 of the sanitized consecutive GPS records are not and the 8 on-target mapped records forms 2 location strings of l = 4 and l = 2, respectively and are used for the subsequent of the PP-TPU analysis. For the rightmost traveller, 3 out of 10 sanitized GPS records are mapped onto the target road and they are not consecutive, so this traveller does not contribute toward the PP-TPU in this experiment. In summary, among the 3 trajectories, the first two belong to U, bu not the third one. Fig 6, we also performed the weighted TPU analysis in Experiment 2, and the results are presented in Fig 7. A similar overall trend in the accuracy of the TPU analysis across is observed as in the nonweighted version. The weighting also seems to polarize the PP-TPU accuracy in that the CDF curves at \u2264 0. 7 : Weighted PP-TPU analysis in Experiment 2 It is practically important to understand the relationship among the per-trajectory privacy budget , the number of travel trajectories K to be collected for PP-TPU, and the accuracy of PP-TPU. This information can be used to help determine how many users' data need to be collected to control the relative error in TPU below a certain threshold for a given , especially for real-time TPU as K varies by weather, car accident, periods of the day, etc. Fig 8 presents the relationship between K, , and the relative error in travel time, defined as the normalized l 1 deviance of the sanitized travel time from the original travel time over K trajectories, based on the data from Experiment 2. As expected, as K increases or per trajectory goes down, the error decreases. For \u2265 0.3, the error can be controlled below 5% for K as small as 100. Similar relationships can be obtained from the other three experiments. ",

For demonstration purposes, we present the results in Experiment 2 only; similar measures can be obtained from the other three experiments. Table 3 shows the expected distance between the sanitized trajectories and the original trajectory calculated via Eq (13) for per-trajectory privacy budget . As expected, the smaller is, the larger the distance is. The utility analysis in Sec 4.3 suggests that satisfactory accuracy can be achieved at = 0.3 for the PP-TPU analysis. Per Table 3 , the adversary error measured by the TD at = 0.3 is 447 meters across the 10 records per trajectory, which would be regarded as large. Taken together, we may claim that a good trade-off between the TPU utility and privacy protection can be achieved at = 0.3. 9 presents the probability distributions of CPD l and correctly identified positions m (whether consecutive or not) for three different clip radius C (20, 40, and 80 meters) when the number of records per trajectory n = 10 for the same set of per trajectory as examined in all 4 experiments. As expected, as C increases (the criterion for claiming correct positioning loosens) or as per-trajectory increases, the adversary's accuracy for correctly identifying more positions and more consecutive positions increase. In the case of C = 80 meters -a rather relaxed criterion for correct identification, the probability of identifying 10 positions out of 10 is > 80%. The probability decreases to \u223c 10% for C = 40 meters and \u223c 0% for C = 20 meters. The plots also illustrate the differences between CPD l and the number of correctly identified locations m. For example, for C = 20, Pr(l = 6) is close to 0%, but Pr(m = 6) is \u223c 20%, regardless of whether the 6 positions are consecutive or not. ",

We provided analytical and empirical utility analysis for sanitized locations, distances, and TPU analysis. Our study suggests it is feasible to employ the GI concept to collect and release GPS information for TPU analysis while guaranteeing location privacy for the individuals who contribute their GPS data.
