Serological immunoassays will play a central role in addressing these challenges for the following reasons 1 . First, serological tests might improve the rate of diagnosis as real-time RT-PCR is associated with a high number of false-negative results due to pre-analytical and other issues 2 . Second, antibody assays may support intensive surveillance measures such as universal testing, active case-finding, contact tracing, and linking clusters and thereby may facilitate an exit strategy from lockdown [3] [4] [5] [6] 9, 10 . In patients with severe disease extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells from the innate and adaptive immune system has been reported to result in a cytokine storm contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Fourteen of them experienced one or more symptoms clearly associated with COVID-19. The remaining eight individuals were clearly positive in at least three assays.

In contrast to their study, we confirmed these findings with an appropriate diagnostic accuracy protocol using different serological immunoassays. In another case-control study, Infantino et al. analyzed 61 COVID-19 inpatient samples and 64 selected patients collected before 2020 using a magnetic chemiluminescent immunoassay 38 . In agreement with their results, we found limited sensitivity but high specificity of the serological SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays.

Third, immunoassays are important to identify individuals with previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who have recovered and to enable adjustment of quarantine measures and physical distancing. Fourth, medical staff with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might be identified and allocated to critical tasks with highly contagious patients. And fifth, vaccination responses in clinical studies could be more effectively monitored. Thus, global authorities including the World Health Organisation strongly encourage studies that investigate performance and application of serological tests for COVID-19. Various receptors including the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed by epithelial barrier tissues and immune cells play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection as they represent a crucial entry point for the virus 7-9 . The sustained inflammatory immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes the development of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and the related prothrombotic state",

For IgG, samples were added to the immobilized antigen in a 1:100 dilution (in IgG sample diluent) for 30 minutes at RT. After washing the plates five times with diluted wash concentrate, 100\u00b5l of HRP-labeled secondary anti-human IgG antibodies were added for 30 minutes at RT. The plates were washed again five times with diluted wash concentrate and 100\u00b5l of TMB solution was added for 20 minutes at RT. The development was stopped by adding 100\u00b5l of 0.5M H 2 SO 4 and results were measured at OD450-620nm. Cut-off for a positive reaction was calculated by the following formula: 1.1*(mean OD Negative Control + 0.18). For IgM, 10\u00b5l of undiluted samples were added to the immobilized anti-IgM in the microtiter plate, and 100\u00b5l of IgM Sample Dilution buffer were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. After washing the plates five times with diluted wash concentrate, 100\u00b5l of HRPconjugated SARS-CoV-2 antigen was added for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed again five times with diluted wash concentrate and 100\u00b5l of TMB solution was added for 20 minutes at RT. The development was stopped by adding 100\u00b5l of 0.5M H 2 SO 4 and results were measured at OD450-620nm. Cut-off for positive reaction was calculated by the following formula: 1.1*(mean OD Negative Control + 0.10). A lateral flow rapid test determining IgG and IgM antibodies against the recombinant S protein (Autobio Diagnostics Co, LTD, Zhengzhou, China) was used according the instructions. Briefly, 5\uf06dl of serum or heparin plasma, or alternatively, 10\uf06dl of whole capillary blood were added to both IgM and IgG cavities of the cassette. 60\uf06dl of reaction Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved buffer were added and reactions were visually read after 15 minutes and assessed as negative, equivocal or positive reactions. Determination of real-time PCR Patient sample material was obtained by performing nasopharyngeal swabs using Copan FLOQSwabs and Copan UTM Viral Transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy). Collected patient sample material was transported to the laboratory at room temperature and stored at 4\u00b0C until processing. For nucleic acid testing (NAT), three different methodologies were used in the respective time period of sample collection. An laboratory developed test (LDT) RT-PCR workflow based on the published protocol of Corman et al. was utilised for pan-Sarbecovirus E-gene detection 35 followed by the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRP-gene. Additionally, two commercial, fully automated workflows, the Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and the Roche cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) were used. RNA for the LDT RT-PCR workflow was extracted after inactivation of patient samples using AVL buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a ratio of 200 \u00b5l sample + 800 \u00b5l buffer using the MagNA Pure 24 system (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or ELITe InGenius SP 1000 extraction cassette on an InGenius System (Elitech, Torino, Italy) and eluted in 100 \u03bcL. Alternatively, an adapted cobas 4800 workflow used the extraction chemicals and protocol for the IVD workflow for the cobas HIV-1 Assay for the cobas\u00ae 4800 System (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) in which 400 \u03bcL noninactivated patient sample eluted in 100 \u03bcL was performed. RNA for the Allplex 2019-nCoV workflow was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions using Seegene's STARlet IVD workflow. RNA for cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions using Roche's cobas\u00ae 8800 system. Seegene Allplex 2019-nCoV and cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a STARlet IVD System or a cobas 8800 system, respectively. For the LDT E-gene and RdRP-gene detection the following was used: RT-PCR assays RNA Process Control Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland; Cat. No. 07 099 Accepted Article amplification, RNA Process Control as an internal control for extraction and PCR and RNA Process Control Detection Assay (proprietary Cy5-labeled probe and primers) for RNA Process Control detection. A 20 \u03bcL reaction contained 5 \u03bcL of RNA, 1.0 \u03bcL of 20x RNA Process Control Detection Assay, 0.1 \u03bcL of 200x RT Enzyme Solution and 4.0 \u03bcL of 5x RT-qPCR Reaction Mix. For E-gene detection, primer/probe sequences and concentrations were used according to the published protocol 35 . Primer/probe sequences and concentrations used for the LDT-RdRP Assay are as follows: / RdRP2-P6mgb; HEX-CATCATCCGGTGATGCT-MQ530; 100 nM. Primer/probe system RdRP1 is specific for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and primer/probe system RdRP2 is specific for detection of SARS-CoV-1. All oligonucleotides were synthesized and provided by Mycrosynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). Thermal cycling was performed at 50 \u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. A Roche Light Cycler 480 instrument was used for amplification and fluorescence detection (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Definition of diagnoses As the primary reference standard test, a positive RT-PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab was defined as 'confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection' (SARS-CoV-2+). In light of the limitations of this test, it was used as the only reference standard for the purpose of this first analysis. Sensitivity analyses using additional reference standards will be employed in subsequent phases of this study (focusing on different clinical manifestations). 'SARS-CoV-2 negative' (SARS-CoV-2-) was defined as (i) a negative RT-PCR result in all nasopharyngeal swabs conducted, or (ii) RT-PCR not performed (because all patients and medical staff would have been tested in case of symptoms according to applicable regulations). Biobank samples from Winter 2018/2019 were also categorized as negative.",

Additionally, the study design allows straight forward expansion to automated immunoassay testing. On the other hand, a potential shortcoming of this study is the limited number of tested individuals. Besides, the observation period was limited to approximately one month, making it impossible to conclude beyond this time point. Our findings emphasize that serological immunoassays are an important diagnostic tool in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While positive ELISA test resultscorrectly identified SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with high probability in our study, the results also revealed that not all cases could be captured. This confirms other studies reporting that many asymptomatic and mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections do not lead to a detectable seroconversion42,43 . In this study, we further confirm that a general timepoint of seroconversion cannot be predicted. However, longitudinal tracing of patients reveals individual seroconversion. So far, the extent of cross-reactivity to other pathogens appears low, but this must as well be addressed in larger patient populations.Moreover, our results from the live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays strongly indicate the presence of protective antibodies in 96.3% of tested sera within the one-month followup period assessed in this study. Previous work in non-human primates have reported that serum dilutions of 1:16 were protective for re-infection with SARS-CoV-244 .
