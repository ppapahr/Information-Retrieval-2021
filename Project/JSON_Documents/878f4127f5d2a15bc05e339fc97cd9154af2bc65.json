Though the motor vehicle accidents (MVA) have drastically reduced due to extensive lockdown, still the patients with low energy and fragility fractures are seeking treatment in emergency. Till date, only a few case reports or series with a small number of patients with fractures have been published in the literature. Hence, the information from one study may not give clear guidance to fracture treatment during COVID 19 pandemic. In many countries the surgeons have not started doing surgeries for various fractures despite various available guidelines due to lack of resources, experience to treat such patients, limited access to negative pressure operation theatres, and COVID related anxiety. We have performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the available studies, by analyzing the fracture types, presentation, treatment, complication, and early outcomes among COVID-19 negative and positive patients.

            "text": "Due to imposed quarantines, travel bans and lockdown, forcing the people to stay at home, there is a substantial decrease in MVA which has caused a reduction in visits to the emergency trauma service. The mean age of the patients with a fracture, in this series, was found to be around 67 years. It is intuitive that younger age groups did not suffer fractures, perhaps due to restrictions on travel on the road, sporting activities, industrial activities etc., and the majority of these patients had a low velocity or a fragility fracture in an older person with osteoporosis. The male to female ratio was 24/20, which is not significant. Recent articles demonstrated that despite the decreased frequency of accidental trauma over the course of the COVID-19 the outbreak, the number of osteoporotic hip fractures remained stable. [8, 16, 17] Zhu et al. [16] reported hip fracture and low-energy injury (fall from standing height and fall from a low height) as most the prevalent injury mechanism, and the home being placed where these injuries commonly occurred. These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures, and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrators. [16] Hip fractures in the elderly are overwhelming injuries that frequently result in long-term disability and can lead to death. Recent studies have shown that elderly patients with fractures associated with medical comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and obesity are more badly affected by COVID-19 infections, due to their reduced functional reserves and weakened immune systems. [4, 12] These patients should be operated as soon as they are medically optimized, as any operative delays beyond 48 hours after admission may increase the odds of 30-day all-cause mortality. [25, 17] This dictum is also applicable to the patients with COVID-19 infection, despite their higher mortality rate, as they might benefit from early An accelerated care pathway should be adopted for a shorter length of hospital stay and subsequently early discharge of patients from the hospital. We suggest that in countries and healthcare facilities where the resources for orthopedic surgery and critical care are not very well developed, the conservative management still has a role to play, in the present pandemic al. [15] opined that old hip fractures if have other underlying medical conditions that may lead to a lengthy hospital stay and increase the chances of transmitting the infection to the health care workers and other patients. Also, a higher death rate is seen in these elderly people, possibly due to a weaker immune system, which also permits faster progression of viral infection. Finally, the stress associated with the fracture and the surgery might itself trigger a series of oxidative stress responses and excessive inflammation leading to a more severe course of infection. Hence, it is advisable to carefully evaluate these elderly patients (with fragility fractures) for surgery, during an outbreak of COVID-19 in order to protect themselves and the health care workers attending to them. [15] The recent COVID Surg multicenter collaborative study included all patients undergoing surgery and having SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery at 235 hospitals in 24 countries and assessed 30-day postoperative mortality,7-day mortality and pulmonary complications. Out of 1128 patients 835 had emergency surgery and 280 had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 patients. 30-day mortality was 23\u00b78% and 7-day mortality was 5\u00b72%( higher risk for ASA grades 3-5 and lower risk for postoperative diagnosis). Pulmonary complications happened in 51\u00b72% cases; and 30-day mortality among these cases was 38\u00b70%, accounting for 81\u00b77% of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex, age 70 years or older,major surgery,emergency surgery, malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis, and higher ASA American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification is certainly a useful tool for foreseeing the patients' outcome significant trend an increase in the ASA physical status is associated with higher perioperative mortality in ICU.",

These complications are due to pro-inflammatory cytokine and immunosuppressive responses to surgery and mechanical ventilation.[27] Patients with COVID-19 infection are at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. It is advisable to use at least standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux in all post-operative patients unless contraindicated. If pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated, a mechanical thromboprophylaxis with the use of elastic socks and intermittent pneumatic compression can be used in patients at highest risk.[29-31] An extension of thromboprophylaxis at hospital discharge should be advised, according to the individual risk, including active mobilization.",

Both tests were positive in 16 patients. RT-PCR had limited availability at several centers initially, so characteristic chest CT findings were used for COVID-19 diagnosis initially in most of the cases.

This period was compared to the 20day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2).A total of 6565 emergency traumatology visits were analyzed: 1909 visits during Period 1 (29.1%), 2161 during Period 2 (32.9%), 1983 during Period 3 (30.2%) and 512 during Period 4 (7.8%). The mean age of the patients was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation: 22.1) and 51.8% (3495/6565) were women.

The patients' mean age was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation (SD): 22.1), and 51.8% were women (3495/6565). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in total visits to the trauma emergency department, workplace accidents, traffic accidents and number of hospital admissions, particularly during Period 4. However, no statistically-significant differences 3 were found in the number of osteoporotic hip fractures admitted between the four periods.
