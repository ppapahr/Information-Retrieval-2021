However, not many studies have been conducted on organizational goals developed an organizational ontology but this study discussed the development of knowledge mapping based on ontology. Previous study did not evaluate any organizational resources such as data, information or knowledge in their model, rather, they developed an ontology to show the relationship between the organizational role and organizational activity. ontology. There are a very limited number of studies which evaluate organizational resources, such as data, in relation to the organizational goals. An ontology shows the relationship between the knowledge domains within the organization. This domain knowledge is important for any future domain expert and entrepreneur to identify the goal elements in their organization. It is important for them to recognize the relevant data in relation to the organizational goals. In order to evaluate the organizational data, metrics is used. We suggest that a metrics model is important in measuring the extent to which the organization data are consistent with the organizational goals. The purpose of the organizational goals ontology is to improve the understanding of the organizational structure and the relationship between the organizational goals. Recent studies focus on the framework and the integration of ontology [3] [4] [5] . These two aspects are very important in the development of every ontology. However, an ontology also needs to focus on relationships and structure, especially in relation to organizational goals. Thus, other aspects that need to be considered are relationships and structure. Relationships and structure are important aspects in the achievement of the organizational goals. Therefore, an ontology is important to improve the common understanding of the structure and relationships in the achievement of the organizational goals.",
