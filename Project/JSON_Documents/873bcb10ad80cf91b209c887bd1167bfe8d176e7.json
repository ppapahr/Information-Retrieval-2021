            "text": "Learning Objectives: To describe principles of CT perfusion studies. To describe standard perfusion protocol for 64-MDCT in abdominal and pelvic neoplasia. To show theoretical deconvolution model for perfusion analysis. Background: 64-MDCT enables an adequate anatomic coverage and temporal resolution for perfusion analysis of solid tumor of abdomen and pelvis. Perfusion studies offer an in vivo evaluation of tumor neo-vascularity. Perfusional parameters evaluated by means of CT perfusion are blood volume, blood fl ow, mean transit time and permeability surface area product. Procedure Details: In our experience, we evaluated some cases of pancreatic tuomr, recatal cancer, urinary bladder and prostate cancer using a 64-MDCT scanner (VCT; GE). Using the follwing parameters: 650 mA, 120 Kv, 0.5 sec gantry rotation time, 5 mm slice thickness acquired for 50 seconds during i.v. administration of iodinated contrast medium (Xenetix 350; Guerbet). The anatomic coverage of the scan was of 4 cm. Image analysis was performed on off-line workstation (adw 4.2; GE) using a dedicated software based on deconvolution alghorithm. Software calculate a colored map pf different perfusional parameters and quantitative data of the same parameters in a region of interest. Perfusional index may correlate with cancer response to neoadjuvant treatments. Conclusion: CT perfusion studies represent a feasible and non invasive tool for in vivo evaluation of tumour neovascularity. 64-MDCT offer the adequate temporal and spatial resolution for the application of perfusion study to solid tumor of the abdomen and pelvis.",

Maetani 2 , N. Morisawa 2 , K. Fujimoto 2 , K. Togashi 2 ; 1 Cambridge/UK, 2 Kyoto/JP, 3 Wakayama/JP (mk435@cam.ac.uk) Learning Objectives: 1. To outline some challenges and solutions for 3 T MRI of the abdomen. 2. To illustrate some promising areas where 3 T MRI has a clinical impact, with the use of emerging techniques. Background: Theoretical doubling effect of SNR is the main reason of improving images at 3 T MRI. However, 3 T MRI of the abdomen seems challenging; susceptibility artifact is more prominent in abdomen due to abundant air-non air interface. Weak RF penetration and RF inhomogeneity at 3 T degrades image quality in body trunk. With fourfold increase of specifi c absorption rate (SAR), SAR limit and heating effect can be critical. In this exhibit, solutions to these diffi culties are proposed. Then potentially useful clinical applications of 3 T are discussed. Procedure Details: MR images of abdomen were obtained by 3 T (Trio:Siemens) unit using phased array coil. For solutions, a more homogeneous RF fi eld can be obtained by using dielectric pads. SAR reduction can be achieved by modifying parameters or using specially-designed sequence. Furthermore, the emerging technique of variable fl ip angle Turbo-Spin echo sequences can reduce the SAR and provides high-resolution 3D images in the order of millimeter. Promising techniques for 3 T include MRCP, breath-holding images. High-resolution images for the pelvis can provide better depiction for carcinomas of the uterine cervix, prostate and bladder. Experimental techniques such as DWI /DTI of abdominal organs can also take advantage of increased SNR at 3 T. Conclusion: Despite some challenges, 3 T MRI of the abdomen has a potential to improve image quality in a clinical setting.",

Sugimura; Kobe/JP Purpose: To assess the effect of diffusion-weighted image (DWI) quality on abdominal apparent diffusion coeffi cient (ADC) measurements and the usefulness of anisotropic images. Methods and Materials: Twenty-six patients (10 men and 16 women; mean, 58.1 years) who underwent DWI and were diagnosed not to have any abdominal diseases were analyzed. Single-shot spin-echo echo-planar DWI was performed and one isotropic and three orthogonal anisotropic images were created. ADCs were calculated for liver (four segments), spleen, pancreas (head, body, tail) , and renal parenchyma. Image quality for each organ part was scored visually. We estimated the correlation between ADC and image quality and evaluated the feasibility of using anisotropic images. Results: ADCs and image quality were affected by motion probing gradient directions in the liver and pancreas. A signifi cant inverse correlation was found between ADC and image quality. The r values for isotropic images were -0.46, -0.48, -0.70, and -0.28 for the liver, spleen, pancreas, and renal parenchyma, respectively. Anisotropic images had the best quality and lowest ADC in at least one organ part in 17 patients. Conclusion: DWI with the best quality among isotropic and anisotropic images should be used in the liver and pancreas.",

Fois; Athens/ GR (dempasso@yahoo.com) Purpose: We retrospectively reviewed the fi les of patients who have been hospitalized with the diagnosis of hydatid disease (HD) for the past 6 years in order to fi nd unusual sites on the human body hosting this disease. Methods and Materials: 294 patient fi les were checked out and patients' mean age was 56.3 years. All patients had a computed tomography study while MRI study was done in 5 of them. Diagnosis was made by imaging features and laboratory studies and verifi ed by pathologic study wherever feasible. Results: Echinococcal cysts were identifi ed in the spleen (5), kidneys (7), abdominal cavity (3), heart (2), thigh musculature (1), spinal canal (3), seminal vesicles (3), testis (1) and ribs (2). Abdominal HD was manifested with symptoms of hydatidemesis in a case of a solitary left subdiaphragmatic calcifi ed cyst with gastro-cystic fi stula while abdominal obstruction was the fi rst sign of a disseminated intraperitoneal disease. Cysts were calcifi ed in 18 (65 %) while cyst diameter ranged from 2 to 13 cm. Primary disease was evident in 12 while abdominal HD was disseminated in 2. IV administered contrast media was given in 9, while typical confi guration of HD was identifi ed in 12 cases. Surgical excision was undertaken in 7 cases. Conclusion: Although liver and pulmonary HD is the most common form of the disease, uncommon locations do exist with low incidence. Imaging studies are of great value in depicting the nature, extend and possible complications of HD. MRI is valuable in musculoskeletal forms, while CT in abdominal disease.",

To determine the current role of US, CT and MR imaging in the detection and characterization of focal spleen lesions. Background: Spleen abnormalities have received little attention in the scientifi c literature. However, recent US, CT and MR imaging advances open new possibilities in the study of splenic diseases. Procedure Details: For educational purposes, we can classify focal splenic lesions into vascular disorders (infarcts), infectious diseases (granulomas, abscesse, and so on), benign tumours (cysts, hemangioma, hamartom,and so on), malignant tumours (metastases, lymphoma and sarcoma), and other hematologic and metabolic disorders (haemochromatosis, Gamna-Gandy bodies, extramedullary haematopoiesis). Conclusion: Although most splenic lesions are detected as incidental fi ndings and have a non-specifi c appearance, the combined use of current imaging tools can often reach the correct diagnosis. US, CT and MR imaging all play an important role in the detection and characterization of focal splenic lesions, and with suffi cient clinical information, they enable the differential diagnosis of these lesions.",

            "text": "The VIBE is an established sequence which permits abdominal imaging in a single breath-hold. Parallel imaging is a novel technique whereby parallel coils permit more rapid spatial localisation of signal independent of conventional spatial acquisition. This allows shortening of image acquisition time. It has previously been used largely with sequences that had high intrinsic signal. Reports on the use of parallel imaging with sequences with low signal to noise such as the VIBE sequence in abdominal imaging are limited. Imaging Findings: Thirty-eight consective patients referred for abdominal MR imaging were included. All patients underwent abdominal MR study that included dynamic post gadolinium sequences with VIBE. In addition, patients underwent further accelerated VIBE sequences with parallel imaging optimised to minimise scanning time (13s vs. 20s). The images obtained with accelerated and conventional VIBE sequences were reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The accelerated VIBE sequence was comparable to conventional VIBE sequence in providing clinically acceptable images. In addition, less motion artifacts were observed in the accelerated images in the sub-group of patients who had diffi culty in breath-holding, resulting in improved image quality. Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility of parallel-imaging accelerated VIBE sequence in upper abdominal MR imaging. The application of parallel imaging minimises scanning time and may be useful in patients who have diffi culty in breath-holding.",

Jaschke; Innsbruck/AT Learning Objectives: To be familiar with pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, and management of autoimmune diseases of liver, biliary system and pancreas relevant to the radiologist. To be familiar with typical fi ndings of various imaging modalities (sonography, MDCT, MRI, MRCP, ERCP) as well as complications and differential diagnosis of autoimmune diseases of liver, biliary system and pancreas. Background: Autoimmune diseases of liver, biliary system and pancreas are recognized as chronic progressive infl ammatory disorders of unknown etiology characterized by immunologic and autoimmunologic features, e.g. circulating autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia. These diseases are associated with characteristic clinical and histologic fi ndings and include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and autoimmune pancreatitis. Imaging Findings: This pictorial assay demonstrates relevant imaging fi ndings with emphasis on typical patterns for early recognition of autoimmune diseases of liver, biliary system and pancreas. Also imaging fi ndings of complications of these diseases are shown, e.g. various types of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular and cholangiocarcinoma, biliary strictures, cholestasis, cholangitis, cholelithiasis and differential diagnosis displayed by cross-sectional imaging modalities peculiar for mentioned autoimmune disease. Also, percutaneous imageguided procedures will be shown including biopsy, transhepatic cholangiography and drainage as well as endoscopic procedures including ERCP and drainage for diagnosis and therapy. Conclusion: Although autoimmune diseases of liver, biliary system and pancreas are rare, early diagnosis with recognition of typical patterns can help avert the consequences of progressive disease and unnecessary surgery.",

Midiri; Palermo/ IT (tv_bartolotta@yahoo.com) Learning Objectives: To illustrate the enhancement patterns of splenic hemangiomas (SHs) evaluated with contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Background: Hemangioma, although infrequent, is the most common primary benign neoplasm of the spleen, with a prevalence ranging from 0.3% to 14% at autopsy. SH is often discovered as incidental fi nding during an abdominal scan conducted for other reasons and more frequently observed in adults with age range from 30 to 50 years, with equal frequency among men and women. Some studies have demonstrated that CEUS is helpful in diagnosing liver hemangiomas. Procedure Details: Two experienced radiologists retrospectively reviewed by conensus baseline and SonoVue \u00ae -enhanced US of 17 patients (10 men, 7 women; mean age: 59.5 years) with 17 SHs (mean size: 2.5 cm) -confi rmed by splenectomy (n=2), CT (n=16) and/or MRI (n=10) -evaluating baseline echogenicity and dynamic enhancement pattern of each lesion, in comparison with adjacent spleen parenchyma. At CEUS, 8/17 SHs showed an isoechoic appearance throughout the vascular phase, whereas 1/17 SH was isoechoic in the arterial phase but became hypoechoic in portal-venous and delayed phases. 4/17 SHs showed a rapid and complete fi ll-in in the arterial phase, but appeared isoechoic (n=2) and hypoechoic (n=2) in delayed phase respectively. 2/17 SHs showed peripheral hyperechoic nodules in the arterial phase, followed by progressive centripetal fi ll-in. 2/17 hemangiomas appeared as hypoechoic lesion in all phases. Conclusion: The majority of SHs evaluated with CEUS presented an isoechoic appearance throughout the vascular phase, showing in some cases contrast-enhancement patterns similar to that of liver.",

The third MRI scan was compared to the histology at surgery. Results: Extent of disease (fi rst MRI): MRI matched mammography and ultrasound in 62 patients (79%) and identifi ed additional disease in 17 patients (21%). Sixteen of these patients had multifocal disease. Response to chemotherapy (second MRI): 10 patients who had a complete pathological response scored 2 or 3 on the second scan.

Conclusion: It is now the policy of our Multidisciplinary Team to use MRI after 2 cycles to change chemotherapy regimes, to plan surgery and to prompt u/s guided marker clip placement if wide local excision (WLE) is likely to be a future option and MRI shows a good response. The third MRI does not always accurately refl ect residual disease, particularly if it is multifocal but it may not be necessary if a mastectomy is planned. It does provide important information in conjunction with mammography and ultrasound if WLE is planned.",

Catalano, R. Passariello; Rome/ IT (federica.pediconi@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted MR imaging for the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions. Methods and Materials: Thirty consecutive women (age range: 35-70 years) with 43 histologically confi rmed benign and malignant breast lesions were prospectively evaluated. All patients were examined at 1.5 T using a dedicated bilateral breast coil. The MR imaging protocol included axial FSE T2-weighted sequences with fat-suppression, axial EPI sequences sensitised to diffusion along 3 orthogonal directions, and pre-and post-contrast axial 3D GRE T1-weighted sequences (gadobenate dimeglumine, Gd-BOPTA; 0.1 mmol/kg). The average apparent diffusion coeffi cient (ADC) value along the 3 orthogonal directions was calculated for all lesions. Differences in main diffusivity (MD) among the lesions were evaluated by means of a non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Results: The 43 lesions evaluated comprised 6 fi broadenomas, 4 cysts, 13 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), 12 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC), 6 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and 2 papilloma. The MD was signifi cantly higher for cysts than for benign fi broadenomas (p < 0.0002) or malignant lesions (p < 0.0002). Furthermore, the MD was signifi cantly lower in malignant respect to benign lesions (p < 0.0004). Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is an inexpensive quantitative procedure that can potentially serve as a corollary to established MR techniques for characterization of breast lesions. Based on diffusion properties, MD maps provide valuable information for the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions.",

Padula, F. Altomari, A. Roselli, V. Dominelli, E. Moriconi, C. Catalano, R. Passariello; Rome/ IT (federica.pediconi@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To assess the impact of bilateral breast magnetic resonance mammography (MRM) on the clinical management of patients with suspected lesions during X-ray mammography or ultrasound. Methods and Materials: 512 consecutive patients with suspected lesions during X-ray mammography or ultrasound were evaluated with contrast-enhanced bilateral MRM between October 2002 and February 2005. Indications of MRM included pre-operative staging (n=296; group 1), undetermined or suspected lesions (n=143; group 2), evaluation of mammarian prosthesis (n=52; group 3), and cancer screening in patients with familial risk (n=21; group 4). MRM, X-ray mammograms, sonograms, and histology were compared to determine the effect of MRM on clinical management in each group. Results: MRM determined changes in clinical management in 72/296 (24.3%) patients in group 1. The altered management was due to a greater lesion size in 22/72 cases, multifocality or multicentricity in 15/72 cases, multifocality/multicentricity and greater lesion size in 5/72 cases, contralateral foci in 28/72 cases, and suspected pectoral muscle infi ltration in 2/72 cases. In group 2, MRM confi rmed possible benign lesion in 71/143 patients,suspected malignant lesion in 38/143 patients, and no lesion in 34/143 patients.

Conclusion: MRM demonstrates high sensitivity for the detection and characterization of suspected lesions. MRM can determine important changes in clinical management and can provide accurate guidance for per-surgical treatment.",

Background: A majority of male breast lesions are benign, with gynecomastia being the predominant pathology. Male breast cancer represents less than 1% of all male breast disease. The most common indication for breast imaging in a male patient is a palpable mass. Sonography, in addition to mammography, is often performed for the evaluation of these lesions. Imaging Findings: The sonographic appearance of the normal male breast is reviewed. Sonographic features of various male breast lesions are illustrated and the specifi c disease entities are reviewed. Benign entities include gynecomastia, infection (abscess formation), and benign masses (lipoma, fi broadenoma, papilloma, sebaceous cyst). Malignant entities include primary breast carcinoma (invasive ductal cancer, papillary carcinoma) and lymphoma. The sonographic and mammographic imaging features are reviewed and correlated with the pathologic fi ndings. The various disease entities are discussed along with their management. Conclusion: Sonography has been shown to aid in distinguishing benign from malignant male breast lesions. Familiarity with the sonographic appearance of various breast lesions is essential in the prompt diagnosis and management of diseases of the male breast.",

These cases were retrospectively reviewed searching for ultrasound detected masses within the pectoralis muscle that were diagnosed with percutaneous procedures (14G needle core biopsy and fi ne needle aspiration). Clinical (age, palpation, previous surgery\u2026), mammographic, ultrasonographic and pathologic fi ndings were studied. Results: Eight patients (0.07 %) had eight intramuscular masses (mean age 60.3 yrs; range 32-78). All patients had a previous malignant diagnosis (seven breast infi ltrating ductal carcinomas and one Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma). Two cases were palpable. Mammograms were normal in all cases. Ultrasound depicted fi ve irregular ill-circumscribed masses, two well-circumscribed masses and one seroma. Seven 14G needle core biopsies and one fi ne needle aspiration (seroma) were performed, with good tolerance and no complications. Pathology results were consistent with fi ve metastatic infi ltrating ductal carcinomas (including the intrapectoral seroma), one lymphoma, one fat necrosis and one schwannoma. Conclusion: Masses within the pectoralis muscle are extremely rare. A biopsy should be performed in these cases because of the high rate of malignancy, especially if the patient has a previous history of a malignant tumor.",

We set out to develop and validate a simplifi ed diagnostic score from multiple logistic regression of US features to determine the likelihood of malignancy of a solid mass. Methods and Materials: 110 patients with 128 biopsies performed in the Department of Oncologic Imaging, National Cancer Centre, Singapore, from October 2003 to June 2004 were included in the study as a training set. Images were reviewed in consensus by two radiologists blinded to the results of the biopsy. Another group of 26 lesions that were biopsied from April to July 2003 in the same centre was used as a validation set. The categories of the tumour descriptors were: shape, margin, echo texture, echogenicity, sound transmission, calcifi cations, surrounding tissue and ductal extension. Results: The training set comprised 98 (77%) benign and 30 (23%) malignant nodules. The simplifi ed diagnostic score with the form DS = 5 + 18C + 17T + 10M + 6ET + 3S + EG -5ST with a possible minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 60 was used. Based on the ROC curve from the simplifi ed DS, a score of > 5 was considered to be malignant.Results of the validation set were comparable to the training set, confi rming the validity of the simple diagnostic model. Conclusion: A combination of US features may be used to predict malignancy, potentially allowing follow-up rather than biopsy in 27% of lesions in our validation set in this preliminary study. ",

Imaging features of papillary neoplasms correlate to the gross pathology. Mammograms and US are frequently normal. Occasionally, we may fi nd in mammography cluster of suspicious microcalcifi cations, gross calcifi cations, benign-appearing mass or a combination of these fi ndings. US may reveal a welldefi ned, smooth-walled, hypoechoic mass or a smooth-walled, cystic lesion with solid components. Galactography usually shows a fi lling defect. Doppler Sonography may demonstrate arterial fl ow. Imaging Findings: We have retrospectively reviewed the imaging fi ndings of intraductal papillomas from our pathology database. Out of a total of 55 patients, mammography was performed in 53, US in 51 and ductography in 28. Core-needle biopsy was performed in 20 cases with a positive result for intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papilloma was silent in mammography in 58% (31/53). A solid intraductal lesion was found in US in 36% (18/51). Ductography showed a fi lling defect in 93% (26/28). Conclusion: Intraductal papilloma has a wide spectrum of imaging manifestations depending on their hystologic subtype. We visualize them as intraductal lesions in galactography and usually in US.

They are more commonly found among elderly women. Its prevalence is strongly age related. Histologically, mucinous carcinoma can be divided into pure mucinous and mixed carcinoma depending on the volume of extracellular mucin. Pure mucinous carcinoma has better prognosis and lower incidence of metastases. Imaging Findings: The mammographic, ultrasound and MRI features are described and illustrated. The most common mammographic and ultrasonographic feature is an oval or lobular microlobulated mass with very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and such imaging fi ndings should suggest a diagnosis when present in an elderly patient.

Dufresne; Montreal, QC/CA (rajan.rakheja@gmail.com) Learning Objectives: To illustrate the broad range of sonographic presentations and associated uncommon pathological fi ndings of fi broadenomas. Background: Fibroadenomas are among the most common breast lesions in pre-menopausal women. Fibroadenomas typically present as palpable, oval, freely mobile, rubbery masses in young women. On ultrasound, a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, homogenous hypoechoic mass is the most common fi nding. However, clinical presentation and sonographic appearance can be highly variable, while pathologic examination can very seldom demonstrate unusual accompanying pathological entities, such as carcinoma. Imaging Findings: Review of our database found 443 fi broadenomas that were sonographically assessed and biopsied between September 2001 and March 2006 in our institution. Fibroadenomas can be considered atypical either by their localization, occurrence in accessory breast tissue in the axilla, or by their sonographic features according to the BI-RADS classifi cation, displaying suspicious or unusual sonographic appearance. Fibroadenomas can also be associated with unusual pathologic components including extensive lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ or even invasive ductal carcinoma. These cases will be illustrated and presented with special emphasis on their unusual features with pathological correlations. Conclusion: While most fi broadenomas are easily diagnosed by a typical clinical and sonographic presentation, the radiologist should be aware of the possibility of rare presentations, ultrasound fi ndings and even associated malignancies.",

Methods and Materials: 73 female patients (24-89 years) with histologically proven breast tumors underwent the routine MR mammography protocol which included whole breast T1-DCE and high-resolution fat suppressed sequences. A second bolus of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA was injected and a dynamic single slice Turbofl ash acquisition (TR/TE/FA/TI 4.9/2.4/50/196, 400 images with a temporal resolution of 0.3s) was performed at the slice where the lesion enhanced maximally. The relative signal changes of the second bolus sequence were deconvolved pixelwise by a model independent method to yield the Impulse Response Function (IRF). The tumor blood fl ow (TBF) and the tumor volume of distribution (TVD) were calculated as the maximum and the time integral of the IRF respectively and the mean transit time (MTT) as the ratio TVD/TBF. Mean values of these parameters were compared between benign and malignant groups. Results: Final diagnosis included: 20 benign and 53 malignant lesions. In all the malignant lesions, the parametric maps clearly delineated tumors from the surrounding breast tissue. Mean TBF and TVD values were signifi cantly higher and mean MTT values were lower in the malignant tumors compared to the benign ones (p < 0.05).",

Jung; Suwon/KR Purpose: To investigate the usefulness of dynamic multidetector row CT (MDCT) in the detection of axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis using morphologic criteria and quantitative analysis. Methods and Materials: Fifty-nine patients with breast cancer underwent MDCT preoperatively. 16-slice dynamic MDCT was performed before, and 90sec and 5 min after an administration of nonionic contrast material. The morphologic features and contrast enhancement of the axillary LN were evaluated using multiplanar reformation and three-dimensional maximum-intensity projection. Short diameter of LN, S/L (short diameter/long diameter) ratio and cortical change were evaluated as morphologic features of LN. Contrast enhancement was quantitatively analyzed using a region-of-interest method to evaluate the enhancement rate and time-density pattern. Results: The hilar obliteration and eccentric cortical thickening was the most sensitive predictor for metastatic LN. The density values at each scanning time were signifi cantly different for metastatic and non-metastatic LN. The sensitivity, specifi city, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of MDCT to detect metastatic LN using morphologic criteria were 81%, 82%, 83%, 79% and 81%, respectively, and the corresponding performances using quantitative analysis were 61%, 71%, 70%, 63% and 66%, respectively. In combined analysis of morphologic criteria and quantitative analysis, the overall sensitivity, specifi city, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 65%, 93%, 91%, 70% and 78%, respectively. Conclusion: Morphologic features detected on MDCT help distinguish metastatic LN from non-metastatic, and was a more valuable diagnostic criteria than that of quantitative analysis.

Purpose: To analyze the clinical and imaging fi ndings of BI-RADS category 3 breast lesions by mammographic and ultrasonographic (US) assessment ultimately diagnosed as malignancy in retrospect Methods and Materials: Of 3,207 cases of US-guided core needle biopsy for 4 years, category 3 was given after biopsy, based on mammographic and sonographic evaluation, in 1,099 lesions (41.7%) that were composed of 462 palpable and 637 nonpalpable lesions. The fi nal pathology was malignancy in 18 lesions (1.6%). Each lesion was retrospectively described using BI-RADS mammographic and US lexicons, and it was assessed whether the lesions were compatible with category 3, and if not, which fi ndings suggested malignancy.

Of 9 lesions improperly categorized as category 3, 8 (89%) were palpable. Four lesions (44.5%) were suspicious on mammography alone (calcifi cation: 2; hyperdense mass: 2), and 4 (44.5%) were suspicious on US alone (microlobulated or nonparallel mass: 2; skin retraction: 1; hypervascularity: 1) and 1 (12%) was suspicious on both examinations. Conclusion: Despite the retrospective nonblinded evaluation of mammography and US, many cases are placed in category 3. Palpable BI-RADS category 3 lesions should be more carefully assessed and should be safely managed by biopsy.",

Background: Papillary carcinomas represent 1-2% of breast carcinomas. Histologically, they can be divided into in situ carcinomas, including intracystic and intraductal types, and invasive carcinomas. As a group, they are considered to have better prognosis than other breast carcinomas because of their usual slower growth. Imaging Findings: Mammography and ultrasound (including Doppler) were performed in all of the 34 patients in our series. Evaluation of lesions with both techniques allowed us to consider most of the lesions as suspicious of malignity (76.4% or 26 of 34 cases), classifying them as 4 or 5 BI-RADS categories. MRI was performed in order to reject multicentricity in 10 patients. Histologically, 38% (13 of 34) was classifi ed as invasive carcinomas. Correlation between the different histological types and the imaging fi ndings is made observing solid nodules more often associated with invasive carcinoma than cystic lesions. We also review other different aspects in our series such as age of presentation, location, size and clinical signs. Conclusion: Acknowledgement of mammography and sonography features in papillary lesions allows the radiologist to suspect carcinoma. In our experience, solid papillary carcinomas are more frequently associated with histological invasion than cystic papillary carcinomas.",

Helmberger 1 ; 1 Luebeck/DE, 2 Birmingham, AL/US (stoeckel@medinf.mu-luebeck.de) Purpose: To evaluate the conduction of heat in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the bovine udder as a model for breast tissue. Especially in superfi cial lesions near the skin surface, heat conduction and demarcation of the ablated tissue is an important issue. Methods and Materials: RFA in a lactating and a non-lactating bovine udder was performed. The needle was deployed under ultrasound guidance. The temperature was applied in 10-degree steps between 60 and 100\u00baC and maintained for 15 minutes at the tips of the prongs. The experiment was repeated three times for each temperature step in the lactating and non-lactating tissue. Histopathologic assessment of the resected specimens was made. The diameter of the ablation zone and demarcation of the ablated tissue margin against the surrounding tissue with respect to the temperature applied was measured. Results: In the non-lactating tissue, there is a direct correlation of the temperature and diameter of the necrosis zone. The maximum ablation diameter was 1.27 in the non-lactating tissue and 1.30 cm in the lactating tissue. There was a sharp demarcation between 0.1 and 0.2 cm in the non-lactating tissue. The transition zone in the lactating tissue was not well visualized below 80\u00baC, ranging between 0 and 0.2 cm. Conclusion: There is little conduction of heat in bovine breast tissue. Sharp demarcation of the ablation zone suggests accurate control of the heat, hence, ideal conditions for RFA in human breast tissue. B D E F A G",

Metzler 1 , W. Jaschke 1 , M. Schocke 1 ; 1 Innsbruck/AT, 2 W\u00fcrzburg/ DE (christian.wolf@uibk.ac.at) Purpose: 31-P-Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) is a unique tool to investigate in vivo high-energy phosphates (HEP) in human heart. We intended to evaluate the impact of low-heart rates on myocardial high-energy phosphates (HEPs). Furthermore, we aimed at comparing training induced. Methods and Materials: Twenty-one male volunteers (mean age 46 \u00b1 11 years) with a physiological heart rate (HR) below 55 bpm were compared to a group of 37 age-matched normofrequent volunteers (HR > 60 bpm). All volunteers underwent 31-Phosphorous 2-dimensional Chemical Shift Imaging (31P-2D-CSI) and cine MR images in short and long-axis acquired using breathhold ECG-triggered cine bright blood sequences to assess their myocardial HEP metabolism by determining phosphocreatinine to beta-ATP ratios (PCr/b-ATP) on the one side and heart morphology and function on the other side using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Results: All volunteers were free of known cardiovascular disease. The detailed results of heart function (ventricular wall thickness, ventricular mass, volume of heart chambers, ejection fraction, stroke volume a.s.o). will be presented. In the spectroscopic evaluation, volunteers with a HR< 50 bpm showed signifi cantly higher PCr/b-ATP ratios than volunteers with a HR> 60 bpm (2.46\u00b10.37 vs. 1.65\u00b10.33, **: p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In this study, we observed a difference in myocardial HEP metabolism between volunteers with bradycardia and normofrequent volunteers. To further determine the effects of endurance training or drug-induced bradycardia on myocardial HEP metabolism, 31P-MRS might be of clinical importance since PCr/b-ATP is a prognostic marker in patients with structural heart failure.",

Strach, D. Thomas, M. Hackenbroch, U. Schwenger, H. Schild, T. Sommer; Bonn/ DE (carsten.meyer@ukb.uni-bonn.de) Purpose: To evaluate high resolution myocardial rest perfusion (HRRP) in healthy volunteers at 3.0 T in comparison to 1.5 T and the technical feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of 3.0 T high resolution myocardial stress perfusion (HRSP) in patients with suspected CAD. Methods and Materials: All perfusion studies were performed using a T1-TFE-sequence. Seventeen healthy volunteers underwent a HRRP at 3.0 T (pixel size: 3.78 mm2) and 1.5 T (pixel size: 9.86 mm2). Myocardial signal intensity (SI) increase was assessed for 3.0 T and 1.5 T. Image quality was evaluated on a four-point grading scale (4: excellent, 1: non-diagnostic) with respect to homogeneity of myocardial enhancement, blurring and presence of artifacts. Nineteen patients with suspected CAD HRSP was qualitatively assessed for stress-induced hypoperfusion. Hemodynamically signifi cant CAD was defi ned as stenosis > 70% in conventional coronary angiography. Results: SI increase in HRRP at 3.0 T was not signifi cantly different from that at 1.5 T (207% \u00b1 43 vs. 199% \u00b1 52, p> 0.05). Image quality was signifi cantly improved at 3.0 T (3.1 \u00b1 0.7 vs. 2.2 \u00b1 0.4, p < 0.01). Mean score of image quality was 2.7 \u00b1 0.7. The mean SI increase was 170% \u00b1 30. Sensitivity and specifi city of HRSP studies at 3.0 T for the detection of signifi cant CAD was 90% and 78%, respectively. Conclusion: HRRP at 3.0 T permits signifi cantly improved spatial resolution and provides signifi cantly improved image quality in comparison to a standard approach at 1.5 T. 3.0 T HRSP is feasible in patients yielding promising results for the detection of signifi cant CAD.

When helpful CT imaging, catheter angiography and echocardiography as well as histologic specimens are presented, important fi ndings for diagnosis, staging and therapy planning will be highlighted. Background: Although cardiac masses are most frequently detected on echocardiography, MRI is the method of choice to accurately evaluate and further characterize cardiac tumors. Imaging Findings: An overview of imaging techniques in cardiac MRI together with proposed protocols to evaluate cardiac masses will be presented. Based on MRI fi ndings and other clinical data, algorithms that give the reader a large spectrum of information to characterize cardiac and paracardiac masses will be presented. Case studies include common and rare benign and malignant as well as tumor-like lesions, with typical and atypical manifestation, and these will be correlated with histology and surgical images. Conclusion: MRI is a valuable tool in the evaluation of cardiac and paracardiac masses. The maximum information is gained if all clinical information together with results of other imaging modalities are taken into consideration. The minimal MR protocols to characterize a lesion should be understood to add important information in the work-up of cardiac and paracardiac masses.",

We analyzed response pattern to adenosine infusion and frequency of adverse events. Results: Adverse events during infusion of the adenosine were observed in 56 patients (44%). The frequency of adverse events ranged from 16 % for warm feeling, 12 % for dyspnea and 8% for chest pain/discomfort to 7% for temporary atrio-ventricular block. All adverse events disappeared quickly without treatment. Signifi cant systolic blood pressure drop (more than 20 mmHg) was seen only in patients with tree vessel disease and occurred mostly in fourth minute of adenosine infusion. Only in 2 cases stress perfusion was not performed because of pressure drop.

Background: Valvular diseases cause fl ow disturbances and consequent fl ow voids on GRE images depending on a variety of factors, especially echo time. Procedure Details: In 15 patients with mitral or aortic valvulopathies we compared area, length and subjective grading of turbulence jets using fast-GRE (11 and 31 kHz receiving bandwidth, prospective or retrospective gating) and SSFP cine sequences with Echocardiography as gold standard. Results: GRE cine sequences with 12-14 msec TEs display well the turbulence jets but require long scanning times and are often degraded by breathing artefacts. Fast-GRE sequences allow breath-hold acquisition but TE is forced to a minimum default value, with consequent impaired detection of fl ow voids. In fast-GRE with prospective gating, reduction of receiving bandwidth to 11-15 kHz allows 8-11 msec TEs, with more marked turbulence jets; fast-GRE with retrospective gating allows the choice of any TE coupled with a higher temporal resolution (at least 20 phases are required). In SSFP blood signal is due to T2/T1 ratio with variable turbulence jets evidence. Good correlation with echocardiography and velocity mapping data has been obtained for retrospective gated fast-GRE cine sequences. Conclusion: Turbulence jets assessment with fast sequences allows rapid semiquantitative evaluation of valvular function identifying patients needing velocity mapping measurements. Fast-GRE techniques showed different sensitivities mainly depending on echo time, but are generally suitable for fl ow assessment. SSFP techniques are not adequate for fl ow evaluation.",

This work focuses on the differences and advantages of high fi eld measurements. Methods and Materials: T2 and T2* proton relaxation measurements in the heart and liver of twelve b-thalassaemic patients were obtained at 1.5 T and 3.0 T, using a respiratory-triggered multi-echo, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin-echo sequence (TR=2000 ms, TE 1 ,TE 2 ,\u2026,TE 16 =6, 12,\u2026,96 ms) and a breathold multi-echo, k-space segmented, gradient-echo sequence (TR= 22 ms, TE 1 ,TE 2 ,\u2026,TE 8 =2.5.4.5,\u2026,16.5 ms), respectively. Both sequences were electrocardiographically gated and prescribed along the short cardiac axis. Moreover, sequence optimization was pursued for 3.0 T measurements.",

Since the water-fat-shift is larger at 3.0 T, fat suppression is suggested for high fi eld measurements. In the patient group studied, there was no signifi cant difference between T2 values measured at 3.0 T and 1.5 T, in terms of iron overload classifi cation (low, medium or high). With regard to T2* determination, heart T2* values obtained at 3.0 T were considerably shorter than the corresponding values obtained at 1.5 T in fi ve subjects. This may be attributed to the increased susceptibility effects at 3.0 T, and may suggest a tool for assessing iron distribution in ferritin and haemosiderin deposits. Additionally, the advanced performance gradient system on the 3.0 T system allows the use of submillisecond TEs, which are necessary for T2* determination in severe myocardial iron overload. Conclusion: The use of 3.0 T seems to benefi t liver and, particularly, heart iron level determination in b-thalassaemic patients.",

Results: We studied 16 patients aged between 4 and 34, 11 of them older than eighteen years. The estimated value of ejection fraction of the right ventricle was over 50% in eight subjects, and under 40% in fi ve. Up to thirteen had PR. VEC-MR sequences concluded regurgitation fraction equal or over 50% in three cases, between 40 and 50% in two, between 27 and 40% in other seven.

CMR is very attractive, however, for it allows an optimal anatomical and functional analysis and does not require iodine nor radiation exposure. Standard 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D-MRA) series may not reveal all anatomical abnormalities because of incorrect timing of peak enhancement. For a better display of the cardiovascular fi ndings, it would be desirable if one could reconstruct such structures at different contrast transit times. The 3D-MRA with TRICKS, available in GE MR scanners, furnishes sequential MRA Gadolinium-enhanced series and allows the selection of the best contrast-enhanced series to study a particular vessel. It would, therefore, be very useful in the evaluation of Aortic Coarctation. Imaging Findings: Patients' mean age was 1.2 years (0-12) and they were referred to either diagnose aortic disease or to post-treatment follow-up. All images underwent extensive time-resolved reconstructions at dedicated workstations and 3DVR data sets were reconstructed in order to unravel the anatomy of the aorta and its main branches. Conclusion: TRICKS is a powerful tool in the evaluation of Aortic Coarctation for it allows precise identifi cation of the aorta disease and of additional cardiovascular malformations, such as PDA. This was the fi rst MRA technique to provide 3D temporal display of the fl ow-abnormalities.",

Background: Using application-specifi c bowties can reduce X-ray dose for CT imaging. GE VCT provides a cardiac bowtie (CB) that redistributes X-ray fl ux to concentrate on the heart. This study evaluates the dose-reduction potential of such bowtie by comparing it to the use of traditional large bowtie (LB) using patient scan data. Imaging Findings: Thirty cardiac patients in each group with similar sex, age, height, weight and heart rate distributions were scanned with LB and CB, respectively. Two experienced radiologists quantitatively evaluated the image quality blindly in terms of the number of coronary arteries identifi ed, vessel edge sharpness and contrast agent clarity in the vessel using scores of 1-4, with 4 being the highest. CTDIw values and image noises for the two sets were measured and statistically analyzed using t-test. The image quality scores for the CB and LB groups were 3.73\u00b10.34 and 3.72\u00b10.29, respectively, with no statistical difference (p> 0.05). However, the CTDIw values for groups CB and LB were 77.66\u00b16.97 mGy and 83.97\u00b17.60 mGy, respectively, with t-test of p=0.0015 indicating statistically signifi cant lower dosage with cardiac bowtie.

The incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) were higher in Group (1) (69% and 36%) than in (4) (34% and 12%). The incidence of CRFs, number of males, DM, hyperlipidemia (HL), and smoking were signifi cantly higher in (1) than in (2). In logistic models, HL and obesity (relative risks 2.40 and 2.52) were associated with incidence of FCP adjoining NCPs. Furthermore we divided group (2) into two groups: (2 A) with exclusive NCP without any CP or (2B) with NCP separate from CP. CRFs were 2.6 (2B) and 1.5 (2 A) and that of (2 A) was similar to (4). Conclusion: CRFs were more frequent in subjects with FCP adjoining NCP than in other groups. FCP adjoining NCP may indicate the advanced arteriosclerosis. Conversely, CRFs were less frequent in subjects with exclusive NCP than in other groups with any NCP and/or CP but similar in subjects with neither NCP nor CP and presence of exclusive NCP may indicate early staged arteriosclerosis.",

Glockner; Rochester, MN/US Purpose: Macroscopic focal fat deposition along the free wall of the right ventricle (RV) has been historically associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Recently, it has been shown that this fi nding can be seen in patients without ARVD. In this investigation, we assess the incidence of fatty infi ltration of the RV in a cohort of patients without clinical evidence of ARVD. Methods and Materials: 120 consecutive patients undergoing non-contrast ECGgated EBCT for coronary calcium scoring comprised the study group. Images were evaluated for the presence or absence of RV fatty infi ltration as well as additional fatty proliferation in the mediastinum, lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum, and changes of thoracic surgery. Medical records were assessed to obtain age, gender, body-mass index, and arrhythmias detected on ECGs obtained within 6 months of imaging. Patients with surgical changes were excluded to avoid falsenegatives secondary to artifact. Images were evaluated, by consensus, by 2 of 3 dedicated cardiac radiologists. Results: Of the 120 patients, 12 were excluded due to lack of required information in the medical records and/or surgical changes. 12/108 (11%) patients had fatty deposition along the RV wall. Conclusion: Focal fatty infi ltration of the RV is a fairly common fi nding in the patient population, and should not be considered as defi nitive evidence of ARVD.",

Correct diagnosis with CT angiography affects the patient's treatment and allows avoiding unnecessary invasive studies. Procedure Details: We retrospectively reviewed CT angiography with 3D reconstruction images of 41 consecutive patients with anomalous pulmonary venous return (16 PAPVR and 25 TAPVR) from June 2002 to March 2006. Twenty-nine pre-operative CT angiography were available and 21 post-operative CT angiography were available; among them, both pre-and post-operative CT angiography were available in 9 cases. We will show the diverse spectrum of anomalous pulmonary venous return and remind the check points in imaging interpretation to provide critical information for surgical planning and post-operative evaluation.

Watanabe 2 ; 1 Hiroshima/JP, 2 Tokyo/JP (kiguchi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp) Learning Objectives: To demonstrate low radiation dose in 64-slice coronary CTA using prospective ECG-triggering. To demonstrate reduction of banding and cone beam artifacts by 3D back projection (3DBP) algorithm. Background: Diagnostic capability of 64-slice CTA for coronary artery disease has been already accepted and become a widely spread use. The major drawback of the technology is the high radiation dose caused by data acquisition with retrospective-ECG gating on which the raw data includes cardiac phases not contributing in image reconstruction. Advancement of ECG-modulated retrospective-ECG gating technique and prospective ECG-triggering scan are strongly desired to overcome this problem. Procedure Details: A 64-row x 0.625 mm-collimation confi guration (40 mm) (GE Healthcare) is used for data acquisition with prospective ECG-triggering. Three or 4 X-ray exposures per examination with 5 mm overlapping cover 11 cm or 14.5 cm in z-axis. Banding artifacts, which are caused by misregistration of data and have been observed so far on retrospective-ECG gating scan, are reduced. Conebeam artifacts seen on multi-slice CT technology are also reduced by 3DBP algorithm. We present initial experiences of this software as to dose saving and image quality. The image quality was assessed on motion artifacts and data continuity (occurrence of banding artifacts), with relation to the scanning time and heart rate. Conclusion: 'SnapShot Cine' 64-slice coronary CTA using prospective ECG-triggering, with signifi cantly reduced dose, has a potential to replace retrospective-ECG gating CTA.",

Cademartiri; Parma/ IT (damianilaura@virgilio.it) Learning Objectives: To provide current methods and guidelines for stratifi cation of cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. To understand the rationale for stratifi cation of cardiovascular regarding different implications of inducible myocardial ischemia in the surgical theatre. To provide an algorithm for stratifi cation of cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery that includes Cardiac-CT. Background: In daily clinical practice, patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery need a stratifi cation of their cardiovascular risk. This is performed by means of scoring methods and diagnostic tests (i.e. ECG, stress-ECG). However, these tests are sub-optimal and because of their low sensitivity and specifi city may under/over-estimate the potential risk. Conventional coronary angiography, which is the diagnostic gold standard, cannot be performed in all patients since it is invasive and the prevalence of signifi cant disease is intermediate or low. Cardiac-CT is a non-invasive method for assessment of signifi cant coronary artery disease characterized by a high sensitivity and negative predictive value. In addition, it can provide the coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden and the type of lesions associated with an individual patient undergoing surgery. These additional informations can change surgical and anaesthesiological management. Procedure Details: 1. Description of current scoring methods and guidelines for pre-operative cardiovascular risk assessment. 2. Description of cardiac-CT features that may improve stratifi cation of cardiovascular risk. 3.

To give tips and tricks for ECG post-processing editing for good image quality in patients with irregular heart rates. Background: ECG and physical examination are the primary evaluations performed to overview heart conditions. The knowledge of ECG is becoming familiar to radiologists involved in non invasive cardiac imaging. Several studies have demonstrated that the synchronization of the scan with an optimal ECG track (i.e. sinus rhythm, heart rate < 65 bpm, no premature beats) minimizes image motion artifacts and signifi cantly increases image quality. In clinical practice, patients with coronary artery disease may have irregular heart rates and software upgrades for CT-CA can help the radiologists to handle premature beats, bigeminism, irregular heart rhythms and other abnormalities. Procedure Details: Drawings for the explanation of ECG basics are presented. Several examples of heart beats abnormalities are shown and improvement of image quality is reported before and after ECG editing. A correct placement of ECG electrodes is mandatory to avoid signal artifacts: It is described how to get the best ECG signal. Conclusion: In clinical practice, patients with coronary heart disease may have irregular heart rates. In the near future, irregular heart rhythm will be not considered as an exclusion criteria for CT of the heart and ECG-editing will become routine in enhancing the image quality and allowing the inclusion of more patients for cardiac CT.",

They predispone to cerebral ischemia as a result of paradoxical thromboembolism by right-to-left shunting under conditions or physiologic maneuvers that raise right atrial pressure (valsalva maneuver). Percutaneous defect closure is reliable for a decade and it needs an accurate depiction of atrial anatomy for a correct surgical planning. Since now, trans-esophagel echocardiography has provided the anatomical and functional informations. Cardiac CT, thanks to an higher spatial resolution, a non-invasivity, a better reproducibility of measurements can provide excellent images of atrial anatomy, helping to correctly choose the best occluder device. Procedure Details: 64-slice CT allows a motion-free 3D images of ASD and PFO. All dimensions of tissue surrounding the defect are measured in systole (during ventricular dyastole) and in dyastole (during ventricular systole). In particular, distance between atrial defect and aortic root and inferior vena cava is measured in CT and echocardiography. Atrial defects and closure devices are compared in 3D visualization, before and after closure procedure.

Kristanto, R. Dikkers, P.M.A. van Ooijen, M.J.W. Greuter, T.P. Willems, M. Oudkerk; Groningen/NL (w.kristanto@rad.umcg.nl) Purpose: To compare visualization of atherosclerotic plaques by Dual Source Computed Tomography (DSCT), Micro Computed Tomography (MicroCT) and histopathology. Methods and Materials: Eleven autopsy specimens of human coronary vessels were scanned with MicroCT (Siemens MicroCATII, Siemens Molecular Imaging, Knoxville, Tennessee) without contrast agent and with DSCT (SOMATOM Defi nition, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) with contrast agent (mean 250 HU). The images were reconstructed at 48 \u00b5m voxel size (MicroCT) and 0.6 mm slice thickness (DSCT). Histopathology analysis was performed afterwards for reference. From the reconstructed images, the morphology of the plaques was compared to the histopathological results. Results: Some calcifi ed spots found by histopathology were detected by DSCT, but were overestimated in size. Some soft plaques observed by histopathology were vaguely shown by DSCT. Smaller calcifi ed plaques and plaque ruptures were observed by histopathology, but could not be detected on DSCT. MicroCT clearly showed small calcifi cations and vessel wall thickening. A lower density structure, suspected as lipid pool, was observed inside one of the large calcifi ed plaques and a possible plaque rupture was also observed in one of the specimens on MicroCT. Conclusion: DSCT tends to overestimate medium and large calcifi ed plaques whereas it misses the small ones. Soft plaques are shown but vaguely. MicroCT shows much more details on plaque morphology, as can be expected by its high spatial resolution. Our fi ndings show that current clinical CT is mainly limited by spatial resolution. Analysis of the fi ndings from MicroCT and histopathology may help interpret the clinically available CT data.",

To understand the possible reasons for the discrepancy between CT and catheter coronary angiography. Background: CT coronary angiography is recently a hot topic. With the advent of MDCT, this technique is gradually integrated into the clinical practice. But this technique is so new that the standards of training, interpretation and clinical practice are not established yet. What are the basic requirements of an 'interpretable' scan? When and why do we misinterpret? Are the misinterpretations avoidable? These are important questions we will try to answer by this review series.

All initial reports and images are critically reviewed by collaboration of two cardiac radiologists and a senior interventional cardiologist. Using catheter coronary angiography as reference, all the misinterpretations are critically discussed. All the lessons learned are summarized with consensus. About the CT aspect, the discussed topics include respiratory motion, heart rate, heart rate stability, arrhythmia, image noise, interpretation skill, post-processing technique, reconstruction phase selection and window settings. Some misinterpretations of catheter coronary angiography are also found during the review process and will be demonstrated and discussed in the exhibit.

The exact knowledge of this anatomic region is extremely important to increase the effi ciency and effi cacy of the procedure, and to reduce the related complications. Methods and Materials: In the last three years, 65 AF patients (15 females, 50 males) underwent MDCT cardiac examination using retrospective gating and dose modulation with reconstruction of 75% of RR ECG interval. Results: In the patient population, we identifi ed 141 right PV, 11 of which were suprannumerary; 112 left PV, 19 of which common trunk and 1 suprannumerary. In 60% of patients, the anatomic pattern was typical (2 right and left PV) and in the remaining 40% atypical (23% 2 right PV and left common trunk; 2% 3 right PV and 3 left PV; 6% 3 right PV and left common trunk). In the defi nition of branching, MDCT identifi ed 55 branchings of the right inferior PV, 41 of the right superior PV, 4 of the left superior PV, 6 of the left inferior PV and 2 of the suprannumerary veins. Conclusion: MDCT represents a fundamental diagnostic imaging tool in the anatomic defi nition of the PV that is characterized by great variability. Radiologists must be familiar with anatomic variants and understand the importance of these variants to the refering cardiac interventional electrophysiologist. Data was also collected on the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and the treatment given to that patient. Data regarding presence of associated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in the PVD group were obtained from the patient's medical record. Results: Age and sex distribution were similar in both groups. Prevalence of risk factors in both groups was as follows (CAD/PVD): 77%/68% hyperlipidaemia, 55%/61% hypertension, 47%/69% smoking, 39%/44% positive family history and 17%/36% diabetes. In the PVD group, 42% and 23% had symptomatic CAD and cerebrovascular disease, respectively. In the CAD group, 12% had symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. Coronary disease on investigation was more severe than in comparable studies Conclusion: This study has shown that the prevalence of risk factors and associated co-morbidity are either comparable or higher than studies carried out elsewhere. Higher prevalence of smoking and diabetes was noted in the PVD group. Findings of the coronary and peripheral angiograms and the resulting treatment will be discussed. Learning Objectives: To discuss the acquisition protocol and reconstruction algorithm which provide optimal image quality of bypass grafts and native coronary arteries with Dual-Source CT. To address artifacts and interpretative strategy for CT coronary angiography in patients after bypass surgery. Background: The recently introduced DSCT scanner permits coronary imaging with high resolution (83 ms), which provides improved image quality in patients with higher heart rates when compared to earlier scanner generations. Moreover the entire heart and graft course can be acquired within a single breath-hold of 8 to 12s. Procedure Details: In this exhibit, we provide examples of DSCT coronary angiography in the evaluation of normal and diseased and occluded bypass grafts. Different bypass surgery techniques are discussed and various examples shown. In addition, we address possible artifacts originating from graft orifi ce indicators, surgical clips and sternal wires, and discuss pitfalls in the evaluation of both bypass grafts and native coronary arteries. Conclusion: DSCT allows high-resolution scanning of the entire thorax within a single breath hold. We demonstrate image quality of DSCT coronary angiography in patients with various heart rates after bypass surgery. We discuss the acquisition protocol and reconstruction algorithm, which provide optimal image quality of both CABG and native coronary arteries. Learning Objectives: 1. To modify the standard protocol of coronary imaging studies in order to depict IVS and right ventricle. 2. To recognize different kinesis pattern of IVS related to various cardiac diseases. Background: Regional kinesis alteration of IVS is associated with different cardiac conditions which may have both pathological and physiological meanings of which the most important are the following: a) left bundle branch block that may determine intra-left ventricular asynchrony and may represent an independent predictor of severe cardiac events in heart failure patients; b) pulmonary embolism that increase right ventricle pressure; c) constrictive pericarditis; d) restrictive cardiomyopathies; e) post-operative cardiac surgery. Procedure Details: A 64-MSCT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, General Electric, Milwaukee) was employed, using the following parameters: 64x0.625 collimation, pitch 0.24, 680 mA, 120 kV, rotation time 350 msec.; i.v. iodinate contrast agent was administrated with a double phase injection : 80 cc at 5 cc/sec followed by 20 cc at 4 cc/sec. Beta-blockers were administered to patients with heart rate above 65 beats per minute (bpm). Axial images were then reconstructed at multiple phases covering the cardiac cycle in increments of 5% of the R-R interval between 0% and 95%. After the reformatted images were transferred to a workstation, contiguous multiphase short-axis and long-axis images were generated using semiautomated interactive software (Advantage Windows 4.2, CardIQ III function, GE Healthcare). Conclusion: 64-MSCT is an effective imaging modality in depicting IVS contraction anomalies. Learning Objectives: To understand normal imaging characteristics of contrastenhanced CT images of myocardium and pericardium, together with a great variety of common and more rare pathologic conditions involving these structures. Background: Since the introduction of 16-and especially 64-slice, CT radiologists are increasingly involved in the execution and interpretation of CT images of the heart and coronary arteries. While there is extensive literature on the imaging of the coronary arteries, CT imaging features of the myo-and pericardium have been scarcely reported. Imaging Findings: It is the aim of this pictorial review to familiarize the radiologist with the common presentation on CT examinations of myo-and pericardium, including normal anatomy variations. Furthermore, a wide variety of diseases like myocardium infarctions of different ages, congenital entities like non-compaction cardiomyopathy, pericardial cysts and other pathologies are reviewed. The images are collected from more than 3000 16-and 64-slice cardiac CT examinations gathered between 2003-2006. Conclusion: Pathology in the myocardium and pericardium is frequently encountered during CT examination of the heart and coronary arteries. Solid knowledge of both normal and abnormal presentation of these structures will increase the diagnostic accuracy of the radiologist, as such limiting errors of interpretation. ",

But at 85 bpm, the image quality with 0.6 s/r was better than the one with 0.5 s/r. 3. At the higher HR (85 bpm, 105 bpm) and wider HR fl uctuation range, MSR could improve the image quality signifi cantly (p < 0.05). Conclusion: HR fl uctuation is an important reason that degrades the image quality. VST could optimize the matching of rotation speed and HR to improve image quality. MSR could provide the better temporal resolution and it is effective in reducing the infl uence of HR fl uctuation.",

Bartolotta 1 , F. Cademartiri 2 , M. Midiri 1 ; 1 Palermo/IT, 2 Parma/ IT (valalaimo@libero.it) Learning Objectives: To display as a correct approach to detect coronary artery disease is based on a careful evaluation of coronary tree by using manual track vessel analysis and MPR/MIP reconstructing approach. To demonstrate as the degree of coronary arteries stenosis is infl uenced by different post-processing techniques. Background: Cardiac MDCT is a non-invasive technique to recognize presence of coronary disease, thanks to the capability to identify vessels remodelling and coronary stenosis. In this exhibit, we will describe the use of different post-processing techniques for the assessment of coronary artery stenosis, such as VR/Auto track approach and MPR/MIP conventional assessment, which are compared. Imaging Findings: Post-processing procedures were performed using auto-cage bone removal/auto track and MPR-MIP/manual track vessels analysis. Images obtained with the methods were compaired. Conclusion: VR images of LAD, CRX and RCA, clearly show the non-calcifi ed stenotic tract of the vessels, but often overstimate the degree of stenosis compared with MPR/MIP assessment. Stenosis of the marginal and diagonal arteries with a small diameter are diffi cult to assess with VR and Auto track analysis. The correct approach for an accurate and complete evaluation of coronary tree cannot exclude the vessels analysis by MPR/MIP reconstruction.",

Oudkerk; Groningen/NL (p.m.a.van.ooyen@rad.umcg.nl) Purpose: Coronary fl y-through, or virtual angioscopy (VA), has been studied ever since its invention in 2000. However, its application was limited because of the requirements for an optimal CT scan and time consuming post-processing. Recent advances in post-processing software facilitate easy construction of VA but until now, image quality was insuffi cient in most patients. The introduction of dual source MDCT could prove to enable VA in all patients. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients were scanned using a dual source MDCT (Defi nition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) using a standard coronary artery protocol. Post-processing was performed on an AquariusWorkstation (TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA). Length travelled per major branch was recorded in mm together with the time required in minutes. Results: VA could be performed in every patient for each of the major coronary arteries. The mean (range) length of the automated fl y-through is 80 (32-107) mm for the left anterior descending, 75 (21-116) mm for the left circumfl ex artery, and 109 (21-190) mm for the right coronary artery. Calcifi cations and stenoses are visualized, as well as most side branches. Mean time required was 3 min for LAD, 2.5 min for LCx, and 2 minutes for the RCA. Conclusion: Dual source MDCT allows for high quality visualization of the coronary arteries in every patient because scanning with this machine is independent of the heart rate. This is clearly shown by the successful virtual angioscopy in all patients. Potential clinical value of the VA should be determined in the near future. and EF between CT and ILVG were 0.3\u00b1126.7 ml, 25.8\u00b140.4 ml, and -21\u00b124%, respectively. In 37 subjects with OMI, the correlation coeffi cients between CT and ILVG for EDV, ESV, and EF were 0.79, 0.84, and 0.60, respectively (all P < 0.01), and the averages\u00b12SD of the differences of EDV, ESV, and EF between CT and ILVG were 8.0\u00b154.1 ml, 28.5\u00b136.7 ml, and -20.5\u00b124.5%, respectively. Conclusion: In all subjects, estimates of EDV, ESV, and EF were signifi cantly correlated between CT and ILVG, but CT tended to underestimate EF. In subjects with OMI, CT tended to overestimate EDV and ESV, and estimates of EF were less correlated between CT and ILVG in subjects with OMI. These discrepancies may be due to capability of CT to estimate LV wall asynergy 3-dimensionally more accurately than ILVG.",

Results: Patency was confi rmed in 70% DES (83, 50 and 50% with 3.5, 3, and 2.5 mm diameters, respectively), and in 87%BMS (100, 88, 95 and 69% with 4, 3.5, 3, and 2.5 mm diameters, respectively). Patency of 30% DES (17, 50, and 50% with 3.5, 3, and 2.5 mm diameters, respectively) and 13% BMS (0, 12, 5, and 31% with 4, 3, 5, 3, and 2.5 mm diameters, respectively) could not be confi rmed because of partial volume effects due to small size. 6% BMS revealed a low CT area inside the stents (1 each with 4, 3.5, and 3 mm diameters). 4% BMS revealed total occlusion (1 each with 3.5 and 3 mm diameters). Conclusion: 64-slice MSCT is a non-invasive diagnostic modality with the potential for evaluating patency of DES with a low incidence of restenosis, especially DES with 3.5 mm diameter. However, due to partial volume effects, it remains diffi cult if the lumen is 3 or 2.5 mm. BMS had a thinner slice thickness and bigger lumens, and their patency was easier to evaluate by MSCT. Background: Within the patients with chest pain and overt coronary artery disease, there are a large number of negative fi ndings. A small niche of these patients present with chest pain that mimics coronary artery disease and they may carry unusual fi ndings. In these patients, the diagnostic challenge may be diffi cult using the conventional diagnostic tools (i.e. history, physical examination, ECG, biomarkers, chest X-ray). CT coronary angiography is increasingly applied in the ER settings for the assessment of patients with atypical chest pain because of its high negative predictive value in populations with low-to-intermediate prevalence of disease. A diagnostic spin-off of CT coronary angiography relates to its capability of showing any thoracic fi nding and therefore several different fi ndings, such as non coronary causes of chest pain, may arise (i.e. pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pulmonary artery fi stula, coronary fi stula, bronchogenic cyst, pericarditis, oesophageal disease, pulmonary sequestrum, mediastinal masses, etc). Imaging Findings: This exhibit will overview all causes of cardio-thoracic syndrome mimicking coronary artery disease. Examples will be provided with patho-physiological explanation. Conclusion: CT coronary angiography applied to cardio-thoracic syndromes is able to detect all major non-coronary causes of chest pain. For this reason, it is becoming the gold standard for chest pain assessment especially in ER settings.",

Methods and Materials: Eighteen patients with known coronary artery disease underwent Gd-CTA, I-CTA and DA. CTs were performed with a 16-row CT scanner. For Gd-CTA, a volume of 0.4 mmol/kg of body weight of gadolinium was administered. For the I-CTA, a volume of 100 ml of contrast material containing 350 mg/ml of iodine was administrated. The axial images and reconstructions of the coronary tree of both acquisitions were reviewed independently and directly compared. The degree of enhancement, the capability of an adequate delimitation of the coronary tree and the detection of coronary artery disease were evaluated. Both acquisitions determined the presence of plaques and measured the coronary stenosis. Those equal or above 50% where considered as positive fi ndings. Results: Gd-MDCT angiography was successfully completed for evaluation in all patients. Axial and multiplanar reconstruction images showed adequate visualization of the main coronary artery. ",

Hao 2 ; 1 Shanghai/CN, 2 Shenyang/CN (lxzmm@yahoo.com.cn) Purpose: To evaluate the effects of contrast medium (CM) injection on the heart rate and its fl uctuation in 16-slice CT coronary angiography (CTCA). Methods and Materials: 140 cases that underwent 16-slice CTCA were included in the study. During calcium scoring and CTCA, waves of electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded in two fl oppy disks. Values of heart rate were recorded, and the differences between the sequential heart beats (D-HR) were calculated. All cases were classifi ed into three groups according to their heart rate: Group 1: < 60 BPM; group 2: 60-70 BPM; and group 3: > 70 BPM. The ECG data of the three groups were compared statistically. ECG data of all the heartbeats and the fi rst fi ve beats after the CM injection were also compared. Results: 239 ECG were included in total, in which 107 ECG were before CM injection and 132 after. The mean BPM of groups 1, 2 and 3 before CM injection were 56.01, 65.13 and 76.47 BPM and after CM injection were 55.26, 64.71 and 76.24, respectively. Mean D-HR of groups 1, 2 and 3 before CM injection were 3.06, 3.27 and 5.52 BPM and after the CM injection they were 3.42, 4.28 and 6.47, respectively. Mean D-HR of all the heartbeats and the fi rst fi ve beats after the CM injection were 4.44 and 2.76 BPM, respectively. Conclusion: Though the mean heart rate after CM injection was a little lower than that before CM injection, the fl uctuation of heart rate increased after CM injection during the 16-slice CTCA. Shortening the scanning time may decrease the fl uctuation of heart rate. ",

Six (3.4%) patients had pulmonary stenosis. Left superior pulmonary vein was the most commonly involved. Remaining important radiological fi ndings also seen in the cases of pulmonary vein stenosis were consolidation and lung nodule. Conclusion: Pulmonary vein stenosis after catheter ablation is an important complication associated with signifi cant morbidity. Our series showed a complication rate of 3.8%, with severe stenosis in a still smaller percentage. The reported incidence ranges from 3% to 42%. Radiologist and clinicians should be aware of this condition in patients presenting acutely following ablation. Learning Objectives: 1) To remind of the major features of the most frequent congenital heart diseases (CHD), including atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and coarctation of the aorta. 2) To expose CT and MR advantages and limits in these indications. 3) To give radiologists clues to better understand clinicians' questions and therefore to answer them better. Background: Because life expectancy of patients with a congenital heart disease (CHD) has improved, thanks to better medical and surgical managements, and thanks too to great improvements in CT and MR imaging, radiologists are more and more faced with these particular conditions. Moreover, as surgical techniques have become more sophisticated and complicated, the need for a precise anatomical description and for functional analyses has become crucial. CT and MRI have these abilities and are complementary. But they also have some drawbacks. Procedure Details: We will illustrate this topic using numerous cases taken from our experience as a CHD care center. All CT exams were performed on a multislice CT, either a 4 or a 64 detectors, whereas MR were performed on a 1.5 T magnet. CT and MR protocols varied, depending upon the congenital heart disease. Conclusion: CT and MRI are powerful tools for the non-invasive evaluation of CHD. Anyone performing these exams has to understand their advantages and limits in order to be able to answer clinicians' questions. ",

The thinsection CT scans were retrospectively reviewed by two thoracic radiologists for the presence, appearance, and distribution of abnormalities. Results: All cases were allogeneic HSC transplant recipients with cGVHD who acquired new respiratory symptoms and/or radiologic abnormalities. Nine cases of air-leak syndrome occurred during the analyzed study period, for a 2-year estimated cumulative incidence of 2.1%, whereas its prevalence was 5.7%. Among all the patients, pneumomediastinum (n=6) and pneumothorax (n=6) accounted for the majority of air-leak syndromes in our series; the remainder were due to subcutaneous emphysema (n=3) and pulmonary interstitial emphysema (n=2). A combination of different air-leak syndromes was observed in 6 cases. In all cases there existed an association between air-leak syndromes and cGVHD-related BO. Conclusion: Air-leak syndromes represent an uncommon late complication in HSC transplant recipients related to cGVHD and BO. ",

To outline the main differential diagnosis. To emphasise the role of imaging evaluation in treatment and follow-up. Background: Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is classifi ed as a subset of lung adenocarcinoma but has a distinct clinical presentation, tumor biology, response to therapy, and prognosis compared with other subtypes of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). It is characterized by growth along alveolar septae without evidence of stromal, vascular, or pleural invasion. Nonmucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma tends to be more localized and has a lower frequency of bronchogenic spread than mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. BAC has received increasing attention in recent years due to its increasing incidence and its rate of sensitivity to epidermal growth factor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Imaging Findings: At computed tomography (CT), the single nodular form appears as a peripheral nodule or localized ground-glass attenuation with or without consolidation, frequently associated with bubble like areas of low attenuation and open bronchus signs. The lobar consolidative form may demonstrate the CT angiogram and open bronchus signs. The diffuse nodular form appears as multiple nodules or areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation. Conclusion: Understanding the radiologic fi ndings of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma on the basis of various morphologic and growing patterns is essential in the initial evaluation of patients with BAC. High-resolution lung CT-scan is necessary to evaluate pulmonary involvement. Imaging evaluation is also essential to assess therapeutic response and follow-up.",

These fi ndings are fully explained and corroborated by a 3-dimensional CT reconstruction. Background: The diagnosis of lobar collapse is the 'bread and butter' of chest radiology but as 3-D imaging takes over, plain fi lm reporting skills are being lost. Procedure Details: We describe the classic patterns of lobar collapse on the plain chest radiograph with the aid of CT correlation to explain the appearances of: Collapse and why it looks the way it does; How to use the silhouette sign; The causes of collapse; The features of collapse. Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis is based on recognised patterns. This presentation uses 3-D CT images to explain the recognised patterns of collapse in plain chest radiographs. (DAD) . TRALI, the transfusion related acute lung injury is an uncommon complication of allogenic blood transfusion typically manifested by bilateral oedema, dyspnea, hypoxemia, fever and hypotension, in presence of a normal cardiac function. The main patterns are pulmonary infi ltrates and eosinophilia, acute pulmonary oedema and upper airway obstruction from laryngeal oedema. Some drugs can also induce severe ALI, such as valproic acid in treatment of neurological epilepsy that can induce alveolar haemorrage or gemcitabine during treatment for breast cancer. Imaging Findings: Acute Lung Injury presents radiological and CT challenges. The chest X-ray demonstrates bilateral infi ltrates without signifi cant increase in cardiac size or vascular pedicle. CT demonstrates ground glass attenuation (a hazy increase in the lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins) in the middle regions and consolidation (increase in lung attenuation that obscures the broncho vascular margins, but the bronchogram sign can be present).",

Background: Diffuse granulomatous lung diseases are a group of lung diseases in which granulomas are an important component of the histologic fi ndings. The term granuloma has been used historically for all reactions rich in histiocytes and mononuclear cell infl ammation; more recently the term has been restricted to cases showing cohesive epithelioid histiocyte clusters usually with associated giant cells (i.e. sarcoid-like granulomas). We use the more restricted defi nition of granuloma in this review, but also include for completeness entities for which the term granuloma has been used historically. Imaging Findings: Depending on the anatomic location and histologic characteristics of the abnormalities, diffuse granulomatous lung diseases may result in several CT patterns: a) nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter, b) small nodules, c) centrilobular nodules and branching lines (tree-in-bud pattern), d) bronchiolocentric infi ltrates, e) ground-glass opacities and consolidation, and f) low-attenuation and mosaic perfusion. Conclusion: This review presents an approach to the differential diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous disorders based on their HRCT features and compares the HRCT with the pathologic fi ndings.",

Imaging Findings: We present representative cases of each of the seven ATS/ERS IMCC categories, describing the clinical, radiological and histologic fi ndings. We provide high-resolution CT images showing the most characteristic fi ndings for each entity and discuss the differential diagnosis. Conclusion: Careful and thorough evaluation of the distribution, extension, and evolution of the radiological fi ndings together with the relevant clinical information enables a strategy to orient the diagnosis of the different types of idiopathic interstitial disease, their severity, and clinical prognosis. The diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases requires an integrated, dynamic evaluation of the clinical, radiological, and histological fi ndings. High-resolution CT is an important tool in the diagnostic work-up of diseases that affect the pulmonary interstitium. Learning Objectives: This poster should give an overview about the CT scan fi ndings and differential diagnosis of diverse pulmonary fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Pneumonias caused by aspergillus, cryptococcus, candida, histoplasma, mucor and geotrichum capitatum are illustrated. Background: The importance of pulmonary fungal infections has increased substantially during the last decades, occurring in patients with neutropenia caused by malignancies, solid organ or stem-cell-transplantation, chemotherapy, corticosteroid-therapy or HIV-infection. Because of unspecifi c clinical symptoms and the high morbidity and mortality of these infections, an early and non-invasive diagnose is very important. Imaging Findings: Pulmonary aspergillosis comprises a broad spectrum of disorders. Allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is typically associated with upper lobe consolidations, mucous-plugging and central bronchiectasis. Semi-invasive aspergillosis is characterized by progressive upper lobe consolidation that may cavitate and harbor mycetomas. The CT halo-sign and, later in the disease, the air crescent sign are characteristic fi ndings of invasive aspergillosis. Cryptococcosis may manifest as a solitary lung mass, as multiple nodules or as segmental or lobular consolidations. In patients with candidiasis, air-space consolidation is most commonly seen with a lower lobe distribution. Histoplasmosis presents with diffuse nodules, small linear opacities or focal or patchy areas of consolidation. The radiological manifestations of mucor mycosis can mimic those of invasive aspergillosis. Geotrichum capitatum can present with bilateral non-cavitated nodules, consolidations and ground-glass-opacity.",

Tamura 2 , P.J. Friedman 1 ; 1 San Diego, CA/US, 2 Miyazaki/JP Purpose: Infl ammatory myofi broblastic tumor of the lung is a rare, benign pseudotumor. The purpose of this study was to describe the CT fi ndings of infl ammatory myofi broblastic tumor of the lung with histopathologic correlation. Methods and Materials: CT images were obtained in 8 patients submitted to our institution over a 9-year period. There were 5 male and 3 female patients, with an age range of 22-73 years (mean age of 55 years). The presenting symptoms were chest pain and cough in 2 cases. For 6 cases, myofi broblastic tumor was an incidental fi nding on chest radiographs. Histopathologic fi ndings were correlated with the imaging fi ndings in all cases. Results: On radiographs and CT images, an ill-defi ned mass or nodule was seen in 5 patients (6 lesions), and a well-defi ned lesion was present in 3 patients (3 lesions). Seven lesions were peripheral, and 2 were centrally located. During CT, 5 lesions were of heterogeneous attenuation, and 4 were homogeneous. Increased perilesional parenchymal abnormalities, which were caused by peribronchial infl ammatory infi ltrates, were seen in 3 cases. The predominant histopathologic feature was organizing pneumonia type in 3 cases, lymphoplasmacytic type in 3 cases, and both organizing pneumonia and lymphoplasmacytic type in 2 cases. Variable degree of fi brous histiocytoma type was noted in all cases. Conclusion: Because of variable imaging features, myofi broblastic tumor of the lung is often misdiagnosed as lung cancer. CT fi ndings combined with certain histopathologic features can suggest specifi c diagnosis. Learning Objectives: To illustrate radiological fi ndings of asbestos-related disease (ARD) involving pleura and lung parenchyma with chest radiographs, conventional CT and High Resolution CT. To emphasize diagnostic features enabling differentiation from benign and malignant lung masses associated with asbestos exposure. Background: Asbestos has been recognised as a potential hazard since the 1940s. ARD is an occupational disease with a long latency period. Our population had a great number of shipyard workers in contact with this dust. A long-term-follow-up of these workers is necessary. Procedure Details: ARD comprises from pleural effusion and pleural plaques to asbestosis, term reserved to interstitial fi brosis, benign masses and malignant lung masses including mesothelioma and bronchogenic carcinoma. Plain fi lms are used to identify presence and extension of asbestos related pleural and lung disease. Conventional CT has been shown to be much more sensitive than chest radiographs in demonstrating these changes and can also identify fi ndings of parenchimal fi brosis such as pulmonary arcades, subpleural lines, parenchimal bands, reticulation and honeycombing. In addition, HRCT can demonstrate thickened interlobular and intralobular lines. Finally, this review will highlight typical characteristics that allows a specifi c diagnosis to determine benign and malignat lung masses, and will focus on spectrum of pseudotumor lesions including round atelectasis, fi ssural pleural plaques and mass-like fi brotic sheets. Conclusion: Rates of ARD remain high in our population due to past occupational exposure and long latency period. Typical imaging features of ARD are described, with special attention to lesions that can mimic neoplastic masses. ",

Background: Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumour with an incidence progressively increasing with time. Malignant mesothelioma has got a grim prognosis attributable to the late detection of the disease. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical history, radiological appearances and histology. Despite all these modalities, diagnosis remains a challenging task to the medical profession as symptoms, imaging and the histological features often mimic other pathologies. Imaging Findings: Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, PET and histology play an important role in the diagnosis and staging of malignant mesothelioma. The spectra of radiological abnormalities noted are pleural effusion, plerual thickening, calcifi ed pleural plaques, interlobar fi ssural thickening, contracted ipsilateral hemithorax, evidence of local and distant metastasis. Histologically, it is divided in to 3 distinct types, 1) Epitheliod (60%), 2) Sarcomatoid (15%) and 3) Biphasic (25%). We present a pictorial review of all these distinct radiological and histological appearances, and also discuss briefl y the importance of these features in the diagnosis and staging of malignant mesothelioma. Conclusion: A good understanding of the radiological and histological appearances is important as this will simplify and fasten the process of diagnosing malignant mesothelioma, enabling a larger number of patients to be diagnosed in the initial stages and undertake more successful treatment options.",

Methods and Materials: After intratracheal instillation of bleomycin in eight mice, in-vivo baseline and 2 weeks (2w) (n=3), 4 weeks (4w) (n=3), or 8 weeks (8w) (n=2) follow-up micro-CT (SkyScan 1076; SkyScan, Belgium) in in-vivo and immediate postmortem state were performed with 35 \u00b5m spatial resolution. On micro-CT, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, reticular opacities, honeycombing, and bronchial dilatation were scored. Pathologic scores including infl ammation, parenchymal fi brosis, and airway fi brosis were obtained. Spearman's correlation analysis to correlate micro-CT and pathology, Kruskal Wallis with Duncan test to compare the 2w, 4w, and 8w groups, and Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare in-vivo and postmortem micro-CT were performed. Results: Consolidation score in both of in-vivo (rho=0.44, p=0.01) and postmortem (rho=0.45, p=0.01) showed correlation with infl ammation score. Score of bronchial dilatation in in-vivo (rho=0.49, p=0.02) and postmortem (rho=0.56, p=0.001) showed correlation with airway fi brosis score.

Left-sided injuries are more frequent, the posterolateral aspect of diaphragm being the most common site of rupture. The preoperative diagnosis is often diffi cult because DR may be overlooked due to associated thoracoabdominal lesions. If the diagnosis is missed, intrathoracic herniation of abdominal organs may occur. Subsequent gastrointestinal strangulation/obstruction will have a mortality rate of up to 50%. Supine chest radiograph remains the initial screening tool after blunt trauma. Helical CT, particularly multidetector-row scanners, allows more accurate analysis of the diaphragm, with the subsequent improvement in diagnosis. Imaging Findings: We reviewed chest radiographs and helical CT scans of 10 patients with surgically proved blunt DR. 100% were left-sided. We describe specifi c chest radiographic fi ndings and several CT signs indicative of DR, such as intrathoracic herniation of abdominal content, dependent viscera sign, collar sign, discontinuity of the diaphragm, absent diaphragm sign, and diaphragmatic thickening. Five patients showed delayed presentation, 3 of them with severe complications: 2 intrathoracic gastric volvulus, 1 transverse colonic strangulation/obstruction.

Padley; London/UK Learning Objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of CT fi ndings of fi brosing mediastinitis. Background: Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare condition characterised by excessive fi brous tissue deposition within the mediastinum. It may present as either an idiopathic condition or as a consequence of an underlying process such as TB or histoplamosis. Procedure Details: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, pathological and imaging fi ndings on 12 cases of fi brosing mediastinitis obtained from our database from 1992 to 2006. Fibrosing medisatinits diffusely infi ltrated the mediastinum in 5 patients and was localized in 7. Eleven of 12 cases had narrowing of mediastinal structures, including 5 with pulmonary artery narrowing (41.6%), 4 with bronchial narrowing (33.3%), 3 with tracheal narrowing (25%) and one with narrowing of the pulmonary vein (8.3%). The presenting complaint was often associated with compression of a relevant mediastinal structure. The disease was considered idiopathic in 7 cases (58.3%) with a demonstrable aetiology in 5 cases (41.6%). Eight out of 12 patients (66.6%) had additional pulmonary fi ndings on CT, including all patients with a known aetiology. Conclusion: Obstruction of vital structures by fi brosing mediastinitis frequently gives rise to complications and is accurately illustrated by contrast-enhanced CT. There is a high incidence of concomitant pulmonary fi ndings, in particular when an identifi able aetiology is present. ",

Moll\u00e1-Olmos 1 ; 1 Alzira/ES, 2 Sabadell/ES (ypallardo@hospital-ribera.com) Learning Objectives: To describe and illustrate the characteristic imaging fi ndings of this rare entity and provide guidelines for its diagnosis. To show the correlation between imaging and endoscopic fi ndings. Background: We retrospectively studied12 patients (7 m and 5 f; mean age: 36.7 yrs). All patients underwent chest X-ray and CT and 3 also underwent MRI. All patients underwent bronchoscopy and clinical follow-up. Imaging Findings: Chest X-ray fi ndings were branching tubular opacity (n=7), nodular opacity (n=3), consolidation (n=3), distal parenchymal hyperinfl ation (n=3), and parenchymal translucency (n=8). CT showed a mucous plug in all cases (n=12), with (n=3) or without air (n=9), severe stenosis of a segmental bronchus (n=11) with surrounding hyperinfl ation in 10 of these. Five patients were studied with a 4-row multidetector CT. Learning Objectives: To familiarize with fetal thoracic MRI in order to be able to recognize normal lung images and the most common thoracic abnormalities. To know the MR indications for the diagnosis of fetal thoracic abnormalities. Background: Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for prenatal assessment of fetal abnormalities. Limitations of US include restricted fi eld of view, dependence on the skills of the operator and the diffi culty to obtain quality images due to maternal obesity or oligohydramnios. In Spain, prenatal US is usually performed by gynaecologists rather than radiologists, and our experience is scarce. When a pulmonary fetal anomaly is detected, different options should be considered, such as in utero surgery, early neonatal surgery or therapeutic abortion, depending on the severity of the abnormality and the availability of a specialized hospital. It is fundamental to establish a precise antenatal diagnosis and the cases where US is inconclusive and doubts arise, must be solved by other reliable imaging modality. MR is safe during pregnancy, and the development of ultrarapid T2-weighted sequences makes it suitable for confi rming US fi ndings. Imaging Findings: We present our experience in fetal thoracic MRI describing the characteristic imaging features of the normal lung and the thoracic abnormalities studied: congenital diaphragmatic hernia (4), congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (3), pulmonary sequestration (2) and situs ambiguous with asplenia (1). Conclusion: MRI is the best choice for confi rming thoracic fetal anomalies when US is not conclusive. As radiologists, we must be familiar with its use and with the basic imaging features of these pathologies. The diaphragm is a musculotendinous structure that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. MRI offers multiplanar capabilities and good tissues contrast resolution. Review the anatomy and diaphragmatic and paradiaphragmatic processes and its appearances in MRI. Emphasis will be placed on diaphragmatic hernia and traumatic pathology. Imaging Findings: To assess hernias and their contents is the most common indication for diaphragmatic MRI and coronal and sagital. T1-Weighted offers an optimal visualisation of the hypointense diaphragm to evaluate the anatomy. MRI also provides tissues characterization of the hernia contents. MRI can be useful in evaluating for transdiaphragmatic extension of disease, primary or metastatic diaphragmatic or juxtadiaphragmatic tumors. Conclusion: MRI of the diaphragm permitted to evaluate small lesion or hernia anatomy and it can answer clinical diagnostic questions with important management implications that others studies of imaging cannot. Knowing normal and abnormal processes allows for the best diagnosis.",

To describe the radiological fi ndings of the complications that may occur with these devices. Background: Chest ports play an important role in the management of oncology patients who need frequent blood products, chemotherapy and other intravenous drugs. Chest port related complications may arise during their placement, removal or the meantime and they may be asymptomatic. Many cases of catheter-induced central thrombosis go unrecognized, but the incidence of pulmonary embolism in this group may be as high as 12%. Plain fi lms, ultrasound and CT are useful for the prompt diagnosis of these complications. General and oncology radiologists rather than interventional radiologists play an important role in their detection. Imaging Findings: Normal imaging fi ndings (plain fi lms, US, and CT) of the different ports and reservoirs and some common interpretation pitfalls, such as thrombus formation inside a vein, are described. Radiological fi ndings of reservoir associated complications such as rotation, thrombosis, and infection and catheter related complications such as mural, tip and sleeve thrombosis, displacement, breakage, migration and infection are discussed. Conclusion: Appropriate knowledge of the normal CR appearance and radiological fi ndings of CR related complications is important in order to facilitate a prompt and effective diagnosis. General radiologists are encouraged to consider the CR as an area of interest when interpreting imaging studies. The knowledge of pathologic processes that affect the chest wall and its radiological fi ndings allow us to establish a specifi c diagnosis in a great percentage of the cases.

The lung and heart are major target organs in this disease. Specifi c manifestations of pulmonary disease include the acute chest syndrome and sickle chronic lung disease. Cardiovascular manifestations include pulmonary hypertension, multiple chamber dilatation, myocardial ischemia and infarction. Thoracic disease is frequently associated with other severe manifestations of sickle cell anemia such as neurological disease and bone infarction. Imaging Findings: We will illustrate the common and uncommon manifestations of SCD including acute chest syndrome, chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. In the acute chest syndrome, plain fi lm fi ndings may be subtle or absent. A rapid progression to multifocal consolidation and an ARDS type picture may occur. CT may demonstrate hypoperfusion and ground glass shadowing and better depicts early changes. Plain fi lm fi ndings in chronic sickle lung disease include fi brosis and cor pulmonale. CT changes include interlobular septal thickening, reticular abnormalities, pleural tags and lobar volume loss. Echocardiographic fi ndings of chamber dilatation and pulmonary hypertension have been extensively reported. SPECT imaging can demonstrate further fi ndings of ischemia or infarction.

Subtype 1 may undergo malignant transformation. There is also overlap between type-4 CCAMs and type-1 pleuropulmonary blastomas. The aim of this study was to determine if pathological subtypes 1, 2 and 4 show characteristic changes on CT that may aid preoperative diagnosis Methods and Materials: CT studies were reviewed for 14 consecutive patients referred postnatally with the histological diagnosis of CCAM on surgical resection. Results: Median age at the time of resection was 3.2 years (range:1.2-23.4). Five patients were females. Five patients had type-1 histology; 6 were type-2 CCAM; and 3 were type-4 CCAM. No type-0 or type-3 lesions were encountered. CT review indicated the following: Most lesions were in the lower lobes (11). Lesion size and cyst number were variable (from 1 to over 40 cysts), and did not depend on histological type. Type-1 lesions had well-defi ned cysts, with maximum cyst diameter exceeding 4 cm. Type-2 lesions had cystic change in 5 cases, with maximum cyst diameter measuring less than 2 cm. Areas of reduced attenuation were also seen (5). Type-4 lesions showed either microcystic (1) or macrocystic change (2), with mass effect demonstrated in all 3 cases, and contralateral mediastinal shift seen in 2 cases. One patient also had pleural nodules. Imaging Findings: Imaging fi ndings are based on chest radiography and computed tomography. Most frequent fi ndings in pulmonary infections are patchy, bilateral and rapidly progressive condensations associated with severe respiratory failure. In addition, 8 patients had brain lesions secondary to embolic dissemination. Imaging fi ndings are fairly similar to those encountered in disseminated aspergillosis; however, all these patients had a fatal and rapid evolution, because this fungus is resistant to all anti-fungal therapies known. Autopsy demonstrated necrosis and hyphae proliferation inside the thoracic and brain lesions. Conclusion: Scedosporium prolifi cans must be included in the differential diagnosis of rapid lung infi ltrates in deep immunocmpromised patients in some western regions of Europe and Australia.",

All the cases illustrated are pathologically proven. Background: Thoracic cancer comprises many different types of cancer that strike the thorax. Some types are common, such as lung cancer and esophageal cancer. Some are rare. Imaging Findings: The pathologies included are lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non Hodgkin's), breast cancer, oesophageal cancer, mesothelioma, sarcoma, thymoma, angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, malignant fi brous histiocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, haemangioendothelioma, plasmacytoma and neurilemmoma. Conclusion: It is important for the radiologists to have an awareness of the imaging fi ndings of the above mentioned thoracic malignancies. When the diagnosis is not clear on a chest radiograph or on computed tomography it is strongly recommended that a biopsy is performed for pathologic confi rmation.",

Bronchoscopic biopsy or percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy was performed by one radiologist and one physician. All cases were confi rmed pathologically. The correlation of tumor stages by PET-CT or chest CT, and both studies combined were evaluated. Also, various false-positive or false-negative fi ndings of PET-CT were demonstrated, thereby causing diffi culties in accurate staging. Results: Agreement in PET-CT for staging of lung cancer is 21.2% (7 cases).

To describe the most relevant fi ndings of the right arch, great vessels and associated anomalies to aid potential surgical procedure. Background: The right-sided aortic arch is an uncommon congenital defect of the aorta. It is present in 0.05% to 0.1% in radiological series. Deletion in chromosome 22q11 is associated in 24% of isolated anomalies of laterality of branching of the aortic arch. Using Edward\u00b4 s hypothesis, three types are described: type 1, with mirror-image branching of the major arteries; type 2, with an aberrant subclavian artery; and type 3, with isolation of the subclavian artery. Congenital heart anomalies are usually present in types 1 and 3. The initial fi ndings by the chest-x ray and barium swallow suggest the anomaly. However, CTA or MRA should be performed to confi rm the defi nitive diagnosis. Background: PH is a complex life-threatening condition with numerous aetiologies. Symptoms such as breathlessness on exertion, fatigue and chest pain are non-specifi c and are often attributed to more common disorders such as asthma delaying diagnosis. Treatment has a profound impact on outcome. A specifi c diagnosis is important as therapeutic options range from surgical intervention to targeted medical therapy. Since biopsy may be hazardous in this patient population, imaging plays a central role in establishing a diagnosis and guiding therapy. Imaging Findings: Imaging features in PH can be divided into those that are common to all aetiologies and those that are disease specifi c. An understanding of the pathophysiology and classifi cation of the PH aids diagnosis. We will present imaging data from patients presenting to a national centre for PH and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with pathologic correlation in specifi c cases.",

To explain the signifi cance of some incidental fi ndings. To emphasize the importance of looking at the heart when interpreting a thoracic CT study, especially in some particular clinical settings. Background: Important information concerning the heart can be obtained on both un-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax. Cardiac disorders can often complicate or coexist with extracardiac thoracic disease, and may often remain unsuspected or underevaluated. Correct analysis of images of the heart and surrounding structures depends on a thorough understanding of cardiac anatomy and on the ability to recognize the normal and abnormal appearances of the heart commonly observed on CT. Imaging Findings: We show anatomic structures that can be misinterpreted (crista terminalis, eustachian valve, fossa ovalis, coronary sinus, valves, pericardial recesses, paracardiac structures); some incidental fi ndings and their clinical value (calcifi cations, dilatations, fat deposition, increased or decreased myocardial density) classifi ed considering the structure involved: valves, chambers, pericardium. We comment on some clinical situations with possible cardiac repercussion: pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, neoplasms, and chest wall disorders. Conclusion: Knowledge of cardiac anatomy is essential to avoid mistaking normal anatomic structures for pathologic processes.

To emphasize the capability of MSCT and MRI to non-invasively map pulmonary venous and left atrial anatomy before the percutaneous ablation. Background: Assessment of pulmonary venous and left atrial anatomy has become a hot topic among cardiac electrophysiologists, as radiofrequency catheter ablation is being increasingly used for atrial fi brillation. Both MSCT and MRI provide detailed and accurate anatomic information about the pulmonary veins and additional anomalies that are commonly associated with the development of atrial fi brillation. Axial images and especially volume-rendered reconstructions allow to precisely determine the anatomy, anatomic variations, anomalous returns, and total number of pulmonary veins, thereby facilitating the interventional procedure. Imaging Findings: In this exhibit, normal pulmonary venous MSCT and MRI anatomy and anatomical variations will be discussed. Anomalous pulmonary venous returns as well as associated anomalies will also be illustrated. The role of MSCT and MRI to non-invasively depict pulmonary venous and left atrial anatomy before the ablation will be emphasized. Conclusion: MSCT and MRI allow a rapid non-invasive assessment of normal pulmonary venous anatomy and associated anomalies. Preprocedural exact delineation of these structures might facilitate the percutaneous intervention in patients with atrial fi brillation. Background: Central venous catheters and other devices are routinely used in the hospitable practice; for this reason, the correct knowledge of the thoracic venous anatomy is basic. MDCT angiography is the best non-invasive method to describe it, and it offers us the possibility to diagnose thoracic venous disorders that could be important for placing catheters and, consequently, to avoid iatrogenic complications. Procedure Details: We employed 16 slice MDCT for study of all chest on a single section helical. A table feed of 5 mm per rotation, and a reconstruction increment of 1.25 mm are used. 100 mL of non-ionic contrast material is injected at 4 mL/second, immediately followed by injection of 30-40 mL of saline solution at the same injection rate. The images were acquires at 20 seconds. At the workstation, we performed multiplanar reconstructions.

Imaging Findings: 2D reformations provide a panoramic view of all the chest structures, allowing the detection of minor fractures. Curved reformations provide information of excellent value in case of spine injuries. MIP-MPVR may be used in the evaluation of vessel injuries as and costal cartilage injuries. Mini-IP is useful in the detection of all lucent lesions, including pneumothorax. pneumomediastinum, tracheobronchial ruptures or pulmonary hernia. Volume rendering is particularly helpful in case of thoracic cage trauma.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight patients (19 males, 9 females, age range 45-68 years) underwent virtual colonoscopy procedure. All of them had undergone optical colonoscopy which revealed 52 polyps and was used as a reference standard. Two radiologists read the datasets from virtual colonoscopy: one after the procedure, non-CAR; the other radiologist read the data sets using CAR. Sensitivities were calculated. All reading times and number of false-positive results were documented. Results: Sensitivities for clinically signifi cant polyps of 5-9 mm and 10 mm or larger in diameter were: 64% and 75%, respectively for 3D non-CAR and 77% and 88% for 3D CAR (p=0.05). False positive rates (mean) were 4.3 and 1.2 for 3D non-CAR and 3D CAR, respectively (p=0.05). The average reading time for 3D non-CAR was 26.2 minutes (SD\u00b13.8) and 18.3 minutes (SD\u00b13.8) for 3D CAR (p=0.001).

However, navigation in this unbounded space requires a quiver of valuable tools named \"search engines\". Three main types of search tools exist: search engines, metasearch engines and subject directories/guides. Any radiological search depends on the strategy used.

Purpose: Retake analysis is a key aspect in any quality assurance programme and a basic tool to avoid unnecessary doses to patients in a radiology department. A methodology to automatically detect potential retakes using DICOM header information is presented. Methods and Materials: A system called QCONLINE was developed to help in the management of images and patient doses in a digital radiology department. Images are sent to the PACS and to a dedicated workstation where the QCONLINE runs. DICOM header information is extracted and transferred to a database. Relevant images can also be archived for inspection. The initial criterion for potential retakes was that 2 or more images have the same patient ID, modality, description, projection and date. This criterion was applied over the 3,742 abdomen and 4,236 chest images. A sample of the images was assessed to determine the goodness of the method.",

Kasai; Chiba/JP Purpose: iPOD, a portable media player, is capable of displaying images and movies. Carrying radiologic images in iPOD would be useful for educating residents, communicating with other radiologists or referring physicians, or informing patients at bedside. The purpose of our study is to evaluate lesion conspicuity on iPOD. Methods and Materials: Fifty sets of key images of either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were randomly collected from computerized database in our department. Any lesions equal or less than 10 mm in diameter were excluded while collecting images. These 50 images with any fi ndings and 50 images without any fi ndings were installed on iPOD. Size and site of the each lesion were recorded. Five blinded radiologists reviewed the images both on iPOD and DICOM viewer with a 4-week interval between sessions. Conspicuity of the lesions was evaluated by using response receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. (d-ust@yandex.ru) Purpose: To determine optimal compression settings and parameters for MR image compression. Methods and Materials: Investigation included 40 patients with various pathologies and consisted of mathematical and visual approaches. The mathematical approach included searching for the Quantitative Quality Index of compressed MR images (with analysis of currently approved quality index-Compression Ratio), compressibility tests, estimation of coders behavior. Visual image evaluation was performed on nine 12-bit head and spine MR images by four observers. Test images were compressed in JPEG, JPEG2000, JPEG-LS at various quality settings (q). Results: Image Compression Ratio (e.g. 8:1, 10:1 etc). is often used as a term equal to Image Quality, but it is unacceptable, because the visual quality of images with the same compression ratio may widely vary. Visually lossless threshold depends on resolution (the lower resolution the higher quality settings required) and body zone (e.g. compressibility of spine images is better than head images). In our study the visually lossless threshold was between q JPEG = 85-92 and q JPEG-LS = 82-94 for four observers. JPEG-LS was the best coder for high quality MR images compression, while JPEG2000 is concluded to be unfi t. JPEG shows a little worse result than JPEG-LS. Conclusion: Compression Ratio cannot be Quantitative Quality Index. In visual analysis, JPEG-LS provided the best image quality with maximum compression. JPEG can be still useful due to good compatibility and high quality. JPEG2000 seems unacceptable because of high resolution and high compression orientation.",

Windows based software (DualX 2.0) was developed to analyze these selective dual phase images with Delphi 9.0. Procedure Details: After image correction, pulmonary enhancement and bronchial enhancement can be calculated by subtraction technique. Then, pulmonary ratio was calculated, which is the proportion of pulmonary enhancement in total enhancement. Pseudo-color map also can be rendered to illustrate these parameters over non-contrast images. Conclusion: Pulmonary phase perfusion and aortic phase perfusion can be evaluated separately. Purpose: To compare the dynamic information obtained from contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (CEMR) on two experimental tumor models exhibiting notable differences in vessel anatomy. Methods and Materials: Six animals subcutaneously injected with a carcinosarcomatoid (A17) cell line and six animals injected with a carcinoma (BB1) cell line underwent CEUS and CEMR. CEUS was performed on a Technos (Esaote, Italy) with a bolus injection (0.01-0.05 ml) of sulphur hexafl uoride microbubbles (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy) into a tail vein. The curve of enhancement (time-intensity) obtained by locating a ROI over the tumor was used to calculate maximal intensity (Mi) and slope (S). CEMR was performed on a Biospec scanner (Bruker, Germany) by injecting Gd-DTPA-albumin (Contrast Media Laboratory, University of California, USA). By locating a ROI over the tumor, we calculated fraction plasma volume (fPV) and transendothelial permeability (kPs). All the tumors were removed and analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically (CD 31). The vascularity of the two different tumor histotypes was comparatively evaluated by immunohistochemical, CEMR and CEUS analyses. Results: Considering the viable areas of the tumor, the vessels of A17 were signifi cantly (P < 0.00001) more numerous and smaller than those in BB1 tumors. CEMR fPV and kPS parameters were signifi cantly (P=0.00001) higher for the A17 tumors than for the BB1 tumors. CEUS Mi and S values were smaller in the A17 tumors than in the BB tumors (P=0.002). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that particular histologic features, such as collapsed intratumoral vessels, can lead to a mismatch between CEUS and CEMR in studying tumor vascularization. Learning Objectives: To discuss the optimisation of acquisition parameters to maximize the ability of Ferumoxtran-10 enhanced MR imaging (USPIO-MRI) at 3 Tesla. To demonstrate tips and tricks for evaluating USPIO-MRI in combination with dedicated software for visualizing 3D localisation of LNs. Background: USPIO-MRI is shown to be extremely accurate for assessment of the LN status in prostate cancer patients. Since positive LN smaller than 4 mm can be accurately detected with USPIO-MRI, appropriate high-resolution imaging is essential to maximize its clinical usefulness. Clinical 3 T whole-body MR system, which is increasingly becoming available, is expected to enable imaging with a higher spatial resolution. Aids with dedicated computer software are now essential in evaluation for numerous high spatial resolution images. Imaging Findings: The exhibit is based on our experiences of USPIO-MRI at 3 T in years, including 3 T-MRI scanner with total imaging matrix. Positive LNs with 2 to 3 mm in diameter can now clearly visualised on USPIO-MRI at 3 T. Thanks to multi-channel capability, both T1 and T2*-weighted image can be obtained with 3DFT-volume data acquisition, which enable to acquire isotropic voxel T2*-weighted images, as well as T1-weighted images. These volume data are evaluated on dedicated software for visualizing 3D localisation of LNs. Conclusion: Combination of novel techniques, 3 T-MRI with TIM technique and USPIO, enable to visualise tiny positive LNs on MRI. Optimisation of the acquisition parameter is essential to maximize the ability of USPIO-MRI. The help of computer technology is vital in handling numerous data to be evaluated.

In 4 cases, CUS and MRI found different results. Conclusion: CUS is useful to detect residual HCC when compared with dynamic MRI results. Because of its low cost and high disponibility, it may reduce the frequency of dynamic MRI in the follow-up of treatment response. Learning Objectives: To provide an educational review of the multifactorial elements of contrast-induced nephropathy. To review the current literature on etiology and prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. To provide evidence-based approach/algorithm when assessing patients undergoing contrast enhanced procedure. To establish a protocol for patient care and follow-up. Background: Contrast-induced nephropathy has become an important cause of iatrogenic acute renal impairment and currently ranks as the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure. Although clinical presentation of CIN is well described, precise mechanisms and management strategies for this complication continue to be a matter of debate. The incidence of CIN (Contrast Induced Nephrotoxicity) is dependent on both the defi nition of CIN and the patient population investigated. The incidence of nephropathy is low in the general population, but patients with increased risk (patients with renal impairment and diabetes) have reported signifi cantly higher frequency (12-50%). Procedure Details: Through a medline literature search and review of a number of current guidelines, we will establish an algorithm of best practice for all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced procedures. We will assess the current evidence on potential prophylaxis (prehydration, acetylcysteine, bicarbonate, fenoldopam, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications prior to contrast-enhanced scans) and those patients that should be targeted for these treatments.",

Background: Iodinated contrast media (CM) are sterile iodine-containing solutions used in almost all diagnostic imaging methods. Since their advent in the 1950s, they have revolutionized diagnostic imaging. Although the diagnostic value of CM is enormous, other less desirable side effects also occur. Procedure Details: The purpose of this review is to address some of the main concerns that arise with the day-to-day use of iodinated CM. This presentation is divided by topics. It provides guidelines recommending precautions to prevent possible iodinated CM reactions. The authors discuss the need for informed consent and measurement of renal function, as well as the risk factors that may predict adverse events, and how to deal with patients who have had a prior reaction. The types and treatment of adverse reactions are discussed. Conclusion: Although iodinated CM are safe and widely used, adverse events occur and questions remain about their use, safety and interactions. Every radiologist should be intimately familiar with CM.",

Metabolic activity was assessed with 3-(4.5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2.5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromid (MTT)-assay. The Trypan-blue test was used to assess cell viability. To detect apoptosis, an ELISA for the determination of oligonucleosomes in the cell lysate was performed. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridin (BrdU)-incorporation into the DNA was measured to assess proliferation. Results: Iomeprol induced a time-and dose-dependent inhibition of MTT-conversion (64-14%, at 4.69-75 mg I/ml at 24 h; 54-41%, at 2-24 h at 18.75 mg I/ml), which was signifi cantly stronger than that induced by mannitol (99-47% at 24 h, p < 0.001).",

Therapeutic response was evaluated at one month with dynamic CT and CEUS. Sensitivity and specifi city of CEUS and dynamic CT were calculated. Results: After RFTA, complete response was observed in 92.7% (group 1) and in 78.3% (group 2) with dynamic CT and in 92.7% (group 1) and 82.6% (group 2) with CEUS.

Given the different types of vascularization of normal and pathological tissues, they offer a better means of characterizing focal lesions than B-mode echography. Procedure Details: Contrast-enhanced US is more accurate than conventional echography in determining the number and size of focal lesions, and revealing capsular involvement, because it reduces the number of false-negative results.

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic advantages of intravenous USPIO administration on T-staging of uterine carcinoma. Methods and Materials: Seventeen female patients referred for gynecological carcinomas, 11 with corpus uterine cancer and 6 with cervical carcinoma underwent MR scan of the pelvis on a 1.5 T magnet. GRE T2*W sequences (TR/TE/FA/matrix/ acq. time: 1800 msec/15 msec/30\u00b0/230x512/13.51 min) were acquired on multiple planes before and 24 hours after iv administration of 2.6 mg/kg of body weight of Sinerem (Guerbet, Paris, France). Image analysis were performed by consensus by two radiologists and it included qualitative and quantitative analysis of signal intensity (SI) of both normal myometrium and neoplastic lesions before and after Sinerem administration. S/N and C/N were calculated. Modifi cation of T-staging in images obtained after Sinerem administration was also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon test (p < 0.05). Results: Qualitative analysis showed a signifi cant decrease of SI of normal myometrium after Sinerem administration leading to a better lesion conspicuity. Quantitative analysis showed a statistically signifi cant difference between SI of myometrium on plain and Sinerem-enhanced MR images assessed by means of t-test. C/N between lesion and normal myometrium signifi cantly increased following Sinerem administration. In 13 patients Sinerem-enhanced images provided additional information leading to more accurate T staging. Conclusion: Intravenous injection of Sinerem provides a signifi cant decrease of SI of normal myometrium with higher C/N between neoplastic lesion and normal myometrium increasing the conspicuity of neoplastic lesions.",

Knowledge of this condition is clinically signifi cant as this may be misdiagnosed as an obstructed hernia, leading to unnecessary surgical intervention during pregnancy. As ultrasound (US) is the imaging modality of choice, we will review the US features that establish an accurate diagnosis. Background: Anatomically the round ligament extends from the lateral uterus to the labium majorus containing veins, arteries, lymphatics and nerves. Pregnancy promotes increased venous fl ow and reduced venous tone, thereby predisposing patients to varicosities. Clinically, RLV and inguinal hernias can be indistinguishable with similar anatomical sites, comparable positive cough impulses and both demonstrating reducibility with positional change. Imaging Findings: Dilatation of the veins of the broad ligament and ovarian plexi cause a clinical entity called the pelvic congestion or pelvic pain syndrome. When this process extends into the round ligament, it becomes a more diffi cult diagnosis. However, the ultrasound and Doppler appearances of this condition are unique and can be easily recognized.",

Intense contrast-enhancement refl ecting hypervascularity of malignant tumors may be the diagnostic clue. Rare solid malignant tumors with honey-combing appearance fi lled with mucinous materials or coagulated necrosis such as mucinous tumors or solid clear cell carcinoma may mimic benign fi bromas, and reticular contrast-enhanced internal patterns may suggest these tumors. Coagulated necrosis with hemorrhagic clots in malignant germ cell tumors may show hypointensity, and elevation of specifi c tumor markers may be helpful for diagnosis. Mucinous, or viscous proteinous materials in mucinous cystic tumors, and struma ovarii with colloid cysts may cause hypointensity in the cystic portions. Repeated intra-cystic hemorrhage in endometrial cysts may cause hypointensity as \"shading\", but similar appearance may also be observed in some dermoid cysts and tubo-ovarian abscesses.

The interface is fl exible and easily adapts to the individual physician's preferences by seamlessly incorporating into the workfl ow. Furthermore, it offers hyperlinks to more comprehensive websites for access to therapeutic and prognostic information for a particular malignancy. Conclusion: www.CancerStaging.info is a free, web-based, customized tool that allows staging of common female pelvis cancers (i.e. cervical, ovarian, uterine and endometrial) based on imaging fi ndings, with hyperlinks to more informative and in-depth websites. It is an intuitive, user friendly educational program which makes staging of common female pelvis malignancies easy and accurate. Learning Objectives: To illustrate the value of color Doppler US as an adjunct technique in the evaluation of those uterine pathologies in which detection and characterization of vascular structures allow an early diagnosis. Background: Ultrasonography (US) is the initial diagnostic modality in gynecological assessment. The transvaginal via is recommended, except in contraindicated cases (intact hymen, pregnancy of more than three months, and so on). Color Doppler US as an adjunct technique has become an effective tool in the evaluation of those uterine pathologies in which detection and characterization of vascular structures allow establishing early diagnosis, when the gray-scale ultrasound images are nonspecifi c or confusing. In this exhibit, we describe the value of color Doppler US in the diagnosis of endometrial polyps, the distinction of leiomyomas and adenomyomas, the evaluation of de arteriovenous malformations, and the diagnosis of aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. Imaging Findings: Color Doppler US contributes to the diagnosis of endometrial polyps by the identifi cation of vascular structures in the pedicle; permits the distinction between leiomyomas and adenomyomas bythe vascular distribution patron; plays an important role in the evaluation of de arteriovenous malformations, allows distinction from myomas with degenerative changes, and detects the presence of arteriovenous shunting. Color Doppler US also plays an important role in the diagnosis of aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. Conclusion: Color Doppler US with conventional techniques and power-angio are very useful in early diagnosis and the follow-up of many uterine pathologies.",

Takeuchi Learning Objectives: To demonstrate various benign ovarian pathologies presenting as cystic masses with solid components on imaging mimicking malignancy with pathologic correlation. Background: Solid components of ovarian cystic masses may usually suggest their malignant nature, but some benign pathologies may also show the similar appearances mimicking malignancy. Imaging Findings: Solid fi brous tumors (Brenner tumor and adenofi broma) coexisting with cystadenomas show characteristic hypointensity on T2-WI refl ecting dense fi brous proliferation. Small tiny cysts within hypointense solid portion (black sponge-like appearance) of adenofi broma are diagnostic. Mural nodules with intense contrast-enhancement and very high intensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) may suggest malignancy, but benign dermoid nipple may show surface slight contrast-enhancement and very high intensity on DWI. Solid portion of struma ovarii also show intense contrast-enhancement, and lobular appearance with hypointense colloid contents on T2-WI is characteristic. Benign cystadenomas may contain small papillary vegetations with no or slight contrast-enhancement. Pregnant decidual changes of endometriomas may show broad-based hyperintense mural nodules on T2-WI. Irregular clots within endometriomas may mimic malignant component, and the absence of contrast-enhancement on subtraction images is the diagnostic clue. Daughter cysts of mucinous cystadenomas, and ovarian parenchyma within peritoneal retention cysts may mimic solid mural nodules on CT or ultrasonography, and T2-WI can provide better tissue contrast for the correct diagnosis. Conclusion: Benign cystic lesions with neoplastic components (Brenner tumors, adenofi bromas, teratomas and vegetations), reactive components (decidualized endometriomas), and non-solid components simulating solid portion (mucinous daughter cysts) should be differentiated from malignancy to avoid excessive surgical procedure.",

To show spectrum of fi ndings of several mullerian duct anomalies at MRI. To illustrate MRI fi ndings useful in predicting the clinical impact of uterine anomalies in terms of infertility or risk of miscarriage. To illustrate MRI fi ndings useful for treatment regimens assessment. Background: Since 1988, the American Fertility Society (AFS) established a classifi cation of uterine malformations. Because mullerian ducts defects are the result of a spectrum of mullerian ducts non-fusion, defi cient development and/or defective canalisation of the uterine cavity, the process may become arrested at any point in development. A complete assessment of uterine anatomy is mandatory in order to evaluate the impact of uterine malformation on women fertility and also to plan the optimal strategy of treatment. Procedure Details: In this exhibit, we describe an optimised MRI protocol including high resolution T2 weighted TSE sequence acquired on dedicated oblique planes for the evaluation of uterine morphology. We describe MR fi ndings of several mullerian duct anomalies according to the AFS classifi cation with emphasis on different subtypes of septate uterus describing fi ndings useful to predict risk of recurrent miscarriage and to programme histeroscopical surgical treatment.

Togashi; Kyoto/JP Learning Objectives: 1) To illustrate MR features of uterine myometrial lesions on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) in correlation with pathologic fi ndings. 2) To discuss the advantages and limitations of DWI and ADC measurement in evaluating uterine myometrial lesions. Background: DWI can provide tissue contrast based on diffusion motion of water molecules, different from that of conventional MR sequences. ADC values calculated from DWI are infl uenced by nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio and cellular density that may be attributed to decreased ADC values of malignant tumors. Since DWI has been recently applied to the female pelvis, knowledge of its advantages and limitations is necessary for evaluating myometrial lesions. Imaging Findings: On DWI, the normal myometrium shows low intensity and the normal endometrium shows high intensity. The vast majority of ordinary leiomyomas and adenomyosis, which show low intensity on T2WI, also exhibit low intensity on DWI. In contrast, uterine sarcomas show prominent increased intensity on DWI. However, even benign lesions such as cellular leiomyomas and adenomyosis with proliferating ectopic endometrial tissues show high intensity on DWI, which can mimic malignancy. Thus, careful evaluation of T2WI is mandatory for avoiding misinterpretation. Although ADC values of these myometrial lesions are usually lower relative to the normal myometrium, distinction between benign and malignant based on ADC values may be diffi cult because of a considerable overlap. Conclusion: DWI and ADC measurements may have a limited role in distinguishing between benign and malignant myometrial lesions. However, careful interpretation of both DWI and T2WI may aid in estimating tissue characteristics of uterine myometrial lesions. Results: OVV was revealed in 65 (47.79%) patients. The frequent clinical complaints were: low abdominal pain, disturbance of menstrual cycle. In 66% of cases, a combination of OVV with structural changes in ovaries was noted (multicystic or polycystic ovaries, the syndrome of ovary inanition). Also, in 46% cases, along with ovarian structural changes the following were also noted: chronical infl ammatory disease in 46%, myoma in 28%, and endometriosis in 26%. In 82% OVV were noted bilaterally, in 12% on the left side, and in 6% on the right side. Based on the diameter and location of varicosis, we defi ned 3 degrees of OOV: I -one side dilatation of ovary vein to 5 mm, II -bilateral OVV and dilatation of plexus venus uterovaginalis from 6 to 10 mm, III -the dilatation above 10 mm in cases of total pelvic veins varicosis. Reno-ovarian refl ux was positive in 53% by Valsalvas maneuver. Conclusion: TVCD is an effective and noninvasive modality in the diagnosis of OVV as a cause of female infertility. In 66%, this pathology with secondary changes in ovaries was combined with various dishormonal gynecological pathologies. Learning Objectives: To evaluate several points to meet the patient selection guidelines in screening pelvic MRI for MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) of uterine fi broids. Background: Currently, all treatment options for uterine fi broids are invasive and require several days of hospitalization and a few weeks of recovery. MRgFUS is newly developed non-invasive procedure to reduce symptoms of uterine fi broids in an outpatient procedure. It combines MRI to visualize the body organs, plans and guides the treatment, and monitors the treatment outcome in real time, with high-intensity focused ultrasound waves, which destroy the tissue. Patients go home after the procedure and usually return to normal activities within a day or two. Unfortunately, it cannot be applied to every patient with uterine fi broids. The decision to perform the MRgFUS in patients with uterine fi broids is made according to the patient-selection guidelines in screening pelvic MRI. Imaging Findings: In screening pelvic MRI, several points must be evaluated carefully to meet the selection guidelines for MRgFUS in uterine fi broids. These include the fi ndings of fi broids itself, obstacles to sonication pathway and relation to adjacent structure. Conclusion: It must be requisite to know thoroughly the fi ndings in screening pelvic MRI to select suitable patients for MRgFUS in uterine fi broids.",

Technical strategies that can optimize local disease evaluation, such as intravaginal gel fi lling, are discussed. Pitfalls, advantages and limitations of MR when compared to other imaging methods, namely MDCT and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), are listed and illustrated comprehensively. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool in the work-up of cervical carcinoma. It optimizes selection of the most suitable therapeutic strategy for each patient, as it provides a more effi cient staging of the disease, evaluating accurately important prognostic factors as tumour volume and presence of lymphatic disease.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-four women who had undergone radical hysterectomy and with locally recurrent uterine cancer were enrolled in our study. All patients underwent gynecologic examination and MRI to assess local recurrence. The recurrences were distinguished based on site: vagina, vaginal vault with or without pelvic wall extension, pelvic side wall. After diagnosis, the patients received concomitant chemo-radiation; then they underwent follow-up MRI 45days after the end of treatment and then periodically every six months. Pre-and post-treatment volumes were calculated by MRI with ellipsoid formula and compared determining tumor response: complete, partial, no change, progression of disease. Image analysis: MRI showed 15 patients with central pelvic recurrence, 9 with recurrence in the pelvic side wall. The mean pre-treatment 3D-volume was 34.96 mm 3 (range 0.29-302.49 mm 3 ). The mean post-treatment 3D-volume was 14.06 mm 3 (range 0-302.49 mm 3 ). 13 patients had complete response, 8 partial response, 2 no change, 1 progression of disease. Results: The site of response was associated to different prognosis; patients with recurrent tumor limited to vagina and vaginal vault showed better loco-regional control rates compared to patients with recurrence in the pelvic side wall. Recurrent 3D tumor volumes < 50 mm 3 had better diagnosis than larger tumor volumes. Furthermore, MRI is an accurate non invasive method of distinguishing tumor from fi brosis. Conclusion: MRI permitted a good evaluation of pelvic recurrences and tumor response following chemo-radiotherapy.",

Quantitative measurement (SNR, CNR) of these structures was also performed. Results: Scans without Buscopan were considerably degraded by intestinal movements. Longer TR generally provided better SNR, although TR=8000 images in fi ve subjects were degraded by motion artifact from small intestine. TR=3200 were associated with high SAR (96-99%) and decreased CNR in the uterine corpus (p < 0.05). ETL=17 provided best images qualitatively. Although lower BW images provided better SNR, BW=175 images were associated with greater blurring. Qualitative evaluation did not reveal remarkable difference between BW=205-260, TE=79-113 images, although BW=300 and TE=148 images had decreased SNR. Low SAR RF pulse provided better SNR without statistical signifi cance. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that the optimal parameters of T2WI at 3 T include TR=4800-6400, ETL=17, BW=205-260, TE=79-113 with RF pulse of low SAR type.

There were 90 biopsy procedures in 83 renal transplants and seven native kidneys with a total number of 243 biopsy needle passes. For each needle pass the presence and duration of CD bleeding were registered. If CD bleeding was seen, CD guided compression was applied. Results: CD bleeding was seen after 63 needle passes in 42 biopsy procedures. The incidence of CD bleeding increased with the number needle passes per procedure. The duration of CD bleeding exceeded four minutes in seven patients, of whom six developed a post biopsy hematoma. Eight of nine of the post biopsy hematomas (mean diameter 2.2 cm) were preceded by CD bleeding. CD guided compression was applied in 42 biopsy procedures. Conclusion: CD is useful in renal biopsies for early detection of post biopsy hemorrhage. The study shows that the duration of CD bleeding correlates with the severity of the bleeding.

To present these fi ndings in the setting of an integrated diagnostic approach. Background: The high frequency of detection of renal lesions and the innovations in their treatment have increased the need for an accurate imaging diagnosis. This exhibit is based on the study of 68 renal tumors that were scanned before and after i.v. injection of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco). Representative CEUS images and the corresponding fi ndings of baseline and color Doppler US, CT, MR and DSA are displayed. Microscopic and macroscopic sections of the excised tumors confi rm these fi ndings and establish the fi nal diagnosis. Imaging Findings: Numerous cases of renal cell carcinomas (clear cell, papillary and cystic varieties), urothelial neoplasms, angiomyolipomas, oncocyttomas (typical and atypical) and a multilocular cystic nephroma are depicted. Several patterns of enhancement are described. The increased sensitivity of CEUS in outlining the pseudocapsule, small cystic areas and heterogeneity in the perfusion of renal tumors is demonstrated. The tortuous pathologic vessels at the periphery of the RCCs and the spoke-wheel pattern of the oncocyttoma are displayed. Challenging cases, such as isoechoic tumors that mimic normal variants and small lesions that are imperceptible on baseline US, are also included. Conclusion: Compared to fundamental US of renal tumors, CEUS may provide valuable additional information. CEUS fi ndings correlate well with those of other imaging methods and can contribute to an accurate diagnosis.

Background: Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for severe endstage renal failure. Because of this, it is very important for the common radiologist to know enough about the diagnosis and management of renal grafts complications, especially the vascular ones, which are a very frequent and severe reason of early graft failure and reject, and a common request of diagnostic procedures in the emergency room. Imaging Findings: We illustrate some examples of the different types of vascular complications associated with renal transplants, including graft artery and recipient iliac arterial system stenoses, arterial and venous thromboses, focal and diffuse infarcts, pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fi stulas. Some examples not only of single kidney grafts complications but of \"En Bloc\" transplants complications are presented. We also discuss the imaging features of vascular complications in grayscale sonography and Doppler sonography, and, in some cases, the appearance of the subsequent fi ndings in MRI and angiography. In addition, we emphasize the characteristic chronology of each vascular complication. Conclusion: Although angiography is still the \"gold standard\" in the diagnosis of vascular complications in renal transplantation, ultrasound is usually the fi rst step in the diagnostic procedure, and is a valuable technicque that allow the radiologists to make an early diagnosis of them.",

To evaluate the role of multislice CT and MRI in primary renal lymphoma. 2. To become familiar with both typical and atypical manifestations of primary renal lymphoma. 3. To review the basic concepts of primary renal lymphoma. Background: Renal lymphoma is most often seen in conjunction with multisystemic, disseminated lymphoma. Reports on primary renal lymphoma are scarce in the urological literature, the most part of them being secondary on a lymphomatous infi ltration of the kidneys. Primary renal lymphoma (PRL) as a clinical entity is not undisputed because the kidneys do not contain lymphatic tissue. Multislice CT is the most sensitive and comprehensive examination for evaluation of the kidneys in patients with suspected renal lymphoma. In particular, it improves detection and characterisation of lymphomatous renal involvement by optimising contrast dynamics and data acquisition and is the current modality of choice for accurate staging of lymphoma. We report the case of three patients with an incidental mass on the kidney; their diagnosis and management are discussed. A literature review on currently recommended diagnostic practices will be presented. Typical and atypical CT patterns which provide a diagnostic challenge will be discussed. Procedure Details: CT scans were performed on a multislice CT. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Conclusion: Multislice CT is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected renal lymphoma; familiarity with the spectrum of fi ndings in renal lymphoma is important for accurate diagnosis and, when necessary, the recommendation of imaging guided percutaneous biopsy.",

Petsas; Patras/GR Purpose: Renal biopsy is a necessary step in the diagnostic work-up of patients with a renal allograft, presenting with renal dysfunction and suspicion of rejection. We evaluated the safety and effi cacy of CT-guided core biopsies in renal transplant patients with deteriorating renal function and clinical suspicion of transplant rejection. Methods and Materials: During the last 2 years, we performed 20 CT-guided biopsies in 17 patients (14 male), mean age 37 (range 21-57) years. The indications for biopsy included: increased serum creatinine 70% (14/20), albuminuria 15% (3/20), delayed renal function 10% (2/20) and progressive functional decline 5% (1/20). The patients underwent pelvic CT and optimal site for tissue sampling was selected. All biopsies were performed using a 20G automated core biopsy needle. One pass per patient was performed. Results: An average of 1 tissue core per biopsy was obtained. Adequate tissue sample (\u22653 glomeruli per specimen) was acquired in all cases. Histological examination revealed tubular atrophy 5% (1/20), acute rejection 55% (11/20), chronic nephropathy 15% (3/20), acute tubular necrosis 10% (2/20), focal segmental tubular sclerosis 5% (1/20) and interstitial fi brosis 10% (2/20). Technical success reached 100%. There were no major post-procedural complications. Conclusion: Core biopsy of the transplant kidney is an essential diagnostic tool for patients with dysfunctional renal transplant and suspicion of rejection. The procedure has a high diagnostic yield, infl uencing in a critical way any further management. CT-guidance offers the advantage of better targeting the kidney allograft in the pelvis, avoiding superimposed bowel loops, and hence decreasing the complication rate.",

First investigator performed 5 or fewer SE targeted biopsies into suspicious (stiffer) regions in the peripheral zone. Hard lesions were considered as malignant. Subsequently, another examiner performed 10 systematic prostate biopsies. The cancer detection rates of the 2 techniques were compared. Results: Cancer was detected in 81 of the 230 patients (35%), including 68 (30%) by SE targeted biopsy and in 58 (25%) by systematic biopsy. The overall cancer detection rate by patient was not signifi cantly different for SE targeted and systematic biopsy (p = 0.132). The detection rate for SE targeted biopsy cores (12.7% or 135 of 1,109 cores) was signifi cantly better than for systematic biopsy cores (5.6% or 130 of 2,300 cores, p < 0.001). SE targeted biopsy in a patient with cancer was 2.9-fold more likely to detect prostate cancer than systematic biopsy. Conclusion: Sonoelastography targeted biopsy detected as many cancers as systematic biopsy with fewer than half the number of biopsy cores. Although an increase in cancer detection was achieved by combining targeted and systematic techniques in this screening population, Sonoelastography targeted biopsy alone is a reasonable approach for decreasing the number of biopsy cores.",

Procedure Details: This medical e-book is a multimedia DVD Rom-based teaching fi le featuring 2500 US prostate images, 150 US video demonstrations, 400 video cases presenting clinical data and detailed description of TRUS techniques, chapters on prostate anatomy, TRUS technique for the detection and staging of PrCa (based on over 10,000 cases), color Doppler, and the technique of USguided biopsies. The proper TRUS technique is demonstrated step by step. Its educational role is based on video cases and double video presentations. The latter consists of a simultaneous presentation of the real-time ultrasound exam and the examiner's technique. A database is included in aiding the user to reach the correct diagnosis and to compare his sonographic image to histologically proven images of the database. Conclusion: User-friendly DVD Rom-based teaching fi le on the prostate with chapters on anatomy, pathology, ultrasound physics, sonographic appearance of the normal prostate, TRUS morphology, detection and staging of PrCa, local anesthesia, USCA and comparative database. Learning Objectives: Review the sonographic fi ndings of non-neoplastic pathologic processes involving the extratesticular structures in the adult patient. Background: The scrotum is a fi bromuscular sac divided by a median raphe. It contains the testis, epididymis, spermatic cord, and associated fascial coverings. These structures can be affected by several pathologies including congenital, infl ammatory and neoplastic.Ultrasonography is the primary modality for imaging the scrotum. It should be performed with the highest frequency transducer that provides adequate penetration. Intratesticular versus extratesticular pathologic conditions can be differentiated with a high sensitivity. Imaging Findings: In this pictorial review, we describe and illustrate cases selected from our radiology department fi les of non-neoplastic extratesticular disorders in adults. The following pathologic entities are included: (1) Fluid collections: hydroceles, hematoceles and pioceles; (2) Epididymis: acute and chronic epididymitis, cysts, spermatoceles and granulomas; (3) Spermatic chord: hematomas, torsion, lipomatous infi ltration and varicocele; (4) Paratesticular masses: inguinal hernias.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-one patients underwent MRI and MRS for the evaluation of tumor location, local extent and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Our imaging protocol included axial, coronal and sagittal T2wi FSE sequences and an axial T1wi FSE sequence. For MRS, we used 3D chemical shift imaging (CSI) spin-echo sequence. We divided the prostatic gland into six sextants and sensitivity, specifi city and accuracy of biopsy, MRI, MRS, MRI+MRS were calculated with pathological correlation. Conclusion: Combined MRI and 3D 1H MRS of the prostate have a diagnostic advantage in tumor location over MRI alone and over biopsy alone. In particular, a negative result at 3D 1H MRS is able to exclude the presence of cancer with high probability. We are further investigating whether there is a correlation between high Gleason score and MRS sensitivity.",

Background: When studying a scrotal mass, the two most important questions to be answered are whether the lesion is intra or extra-testicular, and whether it is cystic or solid. Extratesticular masses, both cystic and solid, are usually benign. However, when the mass is intratesticular, the prognosis of cystic and solid masses is quite different. Intratesticular solid lesions should be considered malignant, whereas intratesticular cystic lesions are most likely benign. Therefore, although intratesticular cystic masses are rare, its recognition is important, in order to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention. Procedure Details: We study clinical, pathological and imaging manifestations of scrotal cystic masses. Intratesticular cystic lesions include simple cysts, tunica albuginea cysts, tubular ectasia of the rete testis, testicular epidermoid cysts (misnamed cyst because it is solid lesion), abscess and, in some cases, infarctions and teratomas. Extratesticular cystic lesions are hydrocele, hematocele, varicocele, spermatocele, papillary cystadenoma, spermatic cord cyst and hernia. US is the fi rst choice modality for studying these lesions.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the concordance of Gleason score between biopsy and radical prostatectomy. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and pathological data of 51 patients who underwent TRUS biopsy and radical prostatectomy between 2004 and 2005. Of the included patients, 9 men had undergone a nonextended sextant biopsy scheme (type A), 33 patients a 6-10 extended scheme (type B), and 9 patients a 10-14 extended biopsy (type C). Clinical parameters were available and sonography fi ndings were included. Biopsy and prostatectomy specimens were reviewed by the same staff. The rate of grading concordance and the effect of different biopsy schemes (A,B,C) on the concordance rate was determined. Results: The TRUS fi ndings and the number of cores affected were similar in the 3 groups (p < 0.011; p < 0.045) according to the Jonckheere-Terpstra test.

Learning Objectives: 1. To illustrate the spectrum of imaging features of tuberculosis of the genitourinary tract. 2. To review the differential diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis. Background: Tuberculosis is the most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases worldwide. The prevalence of this infection has increased over the past decade in most developed countries and extrapulmonary tuberculosis represents a a progressively greater proportion of the new cases. Genitourinary tuberculosis is an important but uncommon form of TB, although it is the second most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Diagnosis is often diffi cult and delayed because TB can mimic many other diseases. Radiologic examinations are very useful to determine the presence of tuberculosis and to monitor de therapeutic effi cacy. Imaging Findings: This pictorial review illustrates the radiological features of genitourinary tuberculosis. It shows intravenous urography, retrograde pyelography, US, CT and MR images of differents stages of tuberculosis affecting the kidney, ureter, bladder and genital tract. Conclusion: Diagnosis of genitourinary tuberculosis is often diffi cult and delayed, as there are many pathologic conditions that can mimic this entity. Although defi nitive diagnosis is established by cultive or histologic examination, radiologic examinations are useful in suggesting the presence of the disease and it is important for the radiologist to be familiarized with the fi ndings of genitourinary TB.",

Takahashi; Sendai/JP Purpose: Adrenal venous sampling is essential for an accurate diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. Information about the anatomy of the right adrenal vein (RAV) obtained by CT would be useful in planning adrenal venous sampling. The purpose of our study is to determine how frequently the RAV could be identifi ed on MDCT and what spectrum of anatomic variations was seen among the RAV. Methods and Materials: Post-contrast MDCT were retrospectively reviewed in104 patients. CT scan was performed with a MDCT (8-row) scanner (1 mm collima-tion, pitch 7). Contrast material (100 mL, 300 mgI/mL) was injected at a rate of 3.5 mL/sec. Axial slices of 1-mm thickness were evaluated. The following points were evaluated regarding the RAV: The rate of visualization, the relationship to an accessory hepatic vein, the anatomy, including the location of the orifi ce in relation to the IVC, direction from the IVC, length and diameter. Results: The RAV was detected in 79 (76%) of 104 patients. The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 8%. The RAV joined in the right posterior wall of the IVC in 97% and in the left posterior in 3%. The direction of the RAV from the IVC was posterior and rightward in 77%, posterior and leftward in 23%, caudal in 89% and cranial in 11%. The length and diameter averaged 3.8 mm and 1.7 mm, respectively. Conclusion: MDCT enabled identifying the RAV and delineating its anatomy, including the position and relationship to the IVC in most patients. Learning Objectives: To illustrate the use of additional series following unenhanced CT performed for suspected renal colic, to both improve diagnostic certainty and confi rm other important diagnoses. Background: Unenhanced CT is widely accepted as the primary investigation for suspected renal colic. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma may both present with loin pain or haematuria and non-urological pathology may mimic renal colic. In a cohort of cases from our institution, we found that additional series were required in 12% of cases to improve diagnostic certainty. To our knowledge, a review of this subject has not been published in the literature. Imaging Findings: From our cohort of unenhanced CT scans, we illustrate how additional series clarify an uncertain diagnosis. Prone scanning can distinguish a bladder calculus from a calculus at the uretero-vesical junction. CT urography may differentiate a phlebolith from a ureteric calculus. Parenchymal contrast enhancement can confi rm the diagnosis of renal or urothelial malignancy as well as characterize incidental complex renal cysts. Contrast enhancement may also provide additional important diagnostic information in a range of non-urological pathologies. Conclusion: Additional series were required in 12% of cases following unenhanced CT for suspected renal colic to improve diagnostic certainty and confi rm other important diagnoses such as urological malignancy and non-urological pathology, both of which can mimic the presentation of renal colic.",

Learning Objectives: To review imaging fi ndings of genitourinary pathology in the emergency room in a third level hospital according to available diagnostic imaging methods (ultrasound, computed tomography, intravenous urography and interventional radiology). Background: Patients with genitourinary disease represent an important volume of the total number of consultations in emergency services and, therefore, in the daily work of the radiologist on call. The more frequent reasons for consultation in these patients include lumbar or genital pain, febrile syndrome, hematuria, anury or oligoanury, acute renal insuffi ciency and trauma, among others. During the last 18 months (January 2005-June 2006), over 6500 emergency sonography and 4300 CT exams were performed at our center. Genitourinary pathology was involved in approximately 20% of these examinations, either suspected or not. The spectrum of fi ndings in these conditions has been reviewed during this period. Imaging Findings: The detected pathology was classifi ed, fundamentally, in infectious/infl ammatory conditions, obstructive disorders, trauma and complications associated with renal transplantation or other interventional or surgical procedures. Imaging techniques were mainly ultrasonography and CT. Intravenous urography was less frequently used. Interventional radiology had also a therapeutic role in selected cases.",

Purpose: Ureteric calculi are the main consideration in the majority of patients presenting with acute fl ank pain. Unenhanced spiral CT has become the imaging modality of choice in these patients not only because of its unrivalled ability to identify ureteric stones, but also because of its potential to identify other renal and non-renal pathologies.

Incidence of stone disease identifi ed by CT KUB was 45%. The majority of stones (44%) were found in the distal ureter and VUJ. Stone size of \u22655 mm was found in 34% of cases. Secondary signs were reported in nearly 65% of patients with stone disease. Alternative pathologies were identifi ed in 27 cases (15%). Conclusion: Unenhanced CT is an excellent modality for imaging patients with acute fl ank pain. Non-calculus renal and non-renal pathologies can often be identifi ed on unenhanced low-dose CT performed for suspected renal colic. A careful search for these alternative diagnoses should be made in all cases and particularly when the examination does not identify a ureteric calculus.",

CT plays a valuable role in detecting the location of the stone and the presence of obstruction. Urosepsis occurs secondary to pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or any other cause of obstruction. Ultrasound plays a valuable role in its diagnosis and intervention by placing a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter. Ultrasound is utilized in acute renal failure to assess' renal size, parenchymal thickness and presence of obstruction. CT with or with out cystogram is optimal for blunt abdominal trauma when kidney, ureter or bladder injury is suspected. Retrograde urethrogram can be done when a urethral injury is suspected.

Discussion of the role of bowel ultrasound in infl ammatory bowel disease. 2. Pictorial demonstration of typical ultrasound fi ndings. 3. Advantages and disadvantages of ultrasound in IBD compared with other imaging modalities. Background: High-resolution ultrasound has recently become a recognised tool in the evaluation of infl ammatory bowel disease (IBD). With advances in ultrasound equipment and novel imaging techniques, this modality is increasingly being used to diagnose patients at initial presentation, assess disease activity, identify complications, and monitor response to therapy. Imaging Findings: This pictorial review will highlight the features seen in IBD on high-resolution ultrasound, both in and outside the bowel wall. We will outline the role of spectral Doppler in assessing the mesenteric circulation and that of power Doppler in the monitoring of patients. The latter half of the discussion will focus on more recent techniques beginning to be employed in the assessment of IBD. This includes the application of microbubble contrast agents using both power Doppler and harmonic imaging modes to try and measure mural infl ammation, and the role of non-absorbable, anechoic, oral contrast agents in distinguishing small-bowel strictures. Barium studies, CT, and MRI correlation will be provided, where appropriate. Conclusion: High-resolution ultrasound is an evolving modality in the management of infl ammatory bowel disease. It can effectively be used to evaluate patients with clinically suspected IBD at fi rst presentation, and also to monitor known patients with regard to disease activity, luminal and mesenteric complications.

Representative cases for each category were selected and are presented with optical colonoscopic correlation. Imaging Findings: A colonic anastomosis typically presents as a web-like structure with a smooth and sharp border. Distortion of the normal shape of an anastomotic ring can be caused by both insignifi cant lesions and signifi cant lesions. Polypoid lesions at anastomotic ring are typically insignifi cant with protruded suture materials and suture granulomas being the most common etiology. Irregularities of the anastomotic ring such as irregular depression or elevation may represent anastomotic recurrences. Metachronous lesions have the usually morphology of a polyp or a mass at CTC elsewhere in the colon. CTC clearly shows perianastomotic recurrence or distant metastasis. Peritoneal metastatic implant may also be detected at endoluminal fl y-through of CTC by noting an extrinsic compression by the lesion. Conclusion: CTC is a benefi cial and noninvasive surveillance method for post-surgical colorectal cancer. Knowledge of and familiarity with the normal and abnormal post-surgical fi ndings at CTC will help increase the role of CTC in post-surgical follow-up of colorectal cancer. Colonic angiodysplasia has been increasingly recognized as a common source of acute and chronic bleeding in elderly patients, accounting for up to 50% of cases of obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Currently, imaging assesment of gastrointestinal vascular lesions relies on invasive procedures such as endoscopy or angiography, but MDCT has gained acceptance as a minimally invasive technique for imaging of the vascular system. Procedure Details: We retrospectively reviewed 27 cases of colonic angiodysplasia diagnosed by MDCT during past 5 years. In 24 cases, the examination was performed due to acute or chronic recurrent bleeding when colonoscopy failed to show the cause. In 3 cases, colonic angiodysplasia was an incidental fi nding in abdominal vascular studies. The MDCT fi ndings include accumulation of ectatic and tortuous vessels within the colonic wall, early fi lling veins due to arterio-venous-type malformation development, enlarged arteries of the target area, and intraluminal contrast material extravastion in cases of active bleeding. Conclusion: MDCT is a useful tool for the diagnosis of colonic angiodysplasia especially in elderly patients with lower GI bleeeding when colonoscopy fails to establish the diagnosis, avoiding the need of invasive catheter angiography.",

We aim to present this poster as a pictorial review of different appendiceal pathologies with atypical presentations. This will help us analyse the factors leading to false-negative results on CT. Background: Appendicitis is a great mimicker of disease, not just clinically but also radiologically -especially in the adult patient. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis on computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen can prove to be diffi cult at times. Variations in the position, length and location of the vermiform appendix along with the differences in the amount of intra-abdominal fat and clinical presentations contribute to this seemingly simple diagnostic dilemma. Criteria for the diagnosis of appendicitis on CT are well documented in the literature. Learning Objectives: To describe acquisition parameters of CT-colonography protocols using different scanners generations moving from single slice spiral Ct to the 64-MDCT. Background: Nowadays, the \"panorama\" of technical approaches for CTC is expanding offering a wide spectrum of different possibilities. As technology continues to advance, there will be a continuing need to reassess the relative tradeoffs between scan width, image noise, patient dose, image artefacts, breath-hold times, and the number of reconstructed images to be viewed and archived. Procedure Details: We will discuss the relationship between collimation, tube current settings, patient dose exposure and accuracy in polyp detection of various CTC protocols valid for different scanner generations. We will offer some practical guidelines for CTC technique based on evidences of literature and on our personal experience of more than 800 CTC examinations performed on different scanners generation including a 64-MDCT (VCT; GE). Conclusion: A single scanning protocol with identical parameters for all scanners and patients cannot be recommended due to technological differences as well as different clinical indications to CTC. What is possible is to offer general guidelines according to the consensus statement on CTC. Collimation should not be larger than 5 mm for SSCT and no larger than 3 mm for MDCT. With the advent of 64slice MDCT, sub-millimeter collimation will be mandatory, although clinical benefi ts are still unclear. was obtained before and 60 seconds after intravenous administration of Gd-chelate. MR images were evaluated in conference by two observers by seeking for bowel abnormalities and were correlated with conventional colonoscopy (CC) in all cases and with surgery in 7/18 patients. Results: MRC could be successfully performed in all cases, whereas CC was incomplete in 5/18 patients.

The aim of this study was the estimation of the role of MDCT-colonography in the pre-surgical staging and restaging of rectal cancer, treated with pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy. Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight selected patients with histologically proven rectal cancer with initial stage T3/4, N+ and M0 were studied. All patients underwent MDCT-colonography with use of a standard protocol for preoperative staging before and 2-4 weeks after radio/radiochemotherapy. Pre-operative TNM staging was correlated with surgical/histological fi ndings. Results: Histopathological evaluation of the resected tumor revealed complete response in one patient, partial response in 18 and stable disease in 9. Reduction in tumors size was signifi cantly greater in responders than in non-responders and indicated a good reaction to therapy. 67% patients showed tumor downstaging and only 7% nodal downstaging after TNM restaging. MDCT correctly staged T in 22 (78.5%) cases, T was overstaged in 6 (21.5%) due to peritumoral post-therapeutic fi brosis. MDCT correctly staged N in 21 (75%), overstaged in 5 (17.8%) and understaged in 2 (7.2%) cases. Conclusion: MDCT-colonography is an accurate procedure for pre-operative staging and restaging TNM classifi cation in patients with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy and can be used for treatment planning. The greatest diffi culty was distinction between T2 and T3 stage due to peritumoral post-therapeutic fi brosis. All patients underwent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). DWI was performed using a 1.5 T whole body scanner equipped with a phased-array body coil. A single-shot spin-echo type of echo-planar sequence that provided diffusion weighting in the direction of slice selection was used to obtain DW images. The corresponding bvalue to the diffusion sensitizing gradients were b=1000 s/mm 2 . We evaluated the DW images measuring the ADC value of the tumor and compared it with the effect of CRT. The therapeutic effect was assessed according to the WHO criteria, using contrast-enhanced MDCT and esophagography 4 weeks after the treatment. Results: Eight patients were responder and 5 were non-responder. All tumors were detected by DWI (accuracy 100%). The mean ADC value of the tumor was signifi cantly lower than that of the normal esophagus (1.004 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s vs 1.756 x 10 -3 mm 2 /s, p < 0.0001).

Methods and Materials: Transabdominal Doppler US and endoscopy were performed in 38 patients (26 male, 12 female, mean age 54.8 years) with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices. The variceal size and the presence of red signs were determined by endoscopy. Following US parameters of the portal vein were recorded: diameter and cross-sectional area, blood fl ow velocity and blood fl ow volume, perfusion pressure gradient (PPG), and congestion index (CI). Child-Pugh score of liver function was also determined. The US parameters were compared to the endoscopic signs of esophageal bleeding risk.",

Only diameter, cross-sectional area, and blood fl ow volume were signifi cantly different among groups of patients with different variceal sizes. The blood fl ow velocity did not depend on the presence of red signs and variceal size. In addition, recorded US parameters did not reach level of significance between groups of patients with different Child-Pugh score. The sensitivities, specifi cities, and areas under ROC curves of the analyzed US parameters were 62.5-82%, 47.2-79.8%, and 0.79-0.89, respectively. Conclusion: According to our results, transabdominal Doppler US might be of value in non-invasive assessment of the risk of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis. A digital cineradiography with 6 frames/second acquisition was performed in all patients using bolus of 30 ml of liquid (60% weight/volume) barium. In 10 patients standing in the left posterior oblique position and prone in the right posterior oblique position, the oesophagus and oesophagogastric junction were also examined. The water siphon test was performed at the end of the procedure. Results: In all patients, the evaluation of oesophageal motility disorder was possible. In 18 of them, the grade of the disorder was high and barium retention in the oesophagus was also detected. Owing to the stagnation of liquid barium in the terminal oesophagus, the evaluation of oesophagogastric junction was possible only in 10 patients. Of these patients, 7 presented a hiatus hernia and 8 a gastrooesophageal refl ux. Conclusion: Digital cineradiography is a suitable technique for evaluating the functional abnormalities of the oesophagus in patients affected by Sclerodermia. Learning Objectives: To present a pictorial review of the radiological appearances of Achalasia and Pseudoachalasia with emphasis on endoscopic correlation. Background: Barium swallow remains a valuable imaging modality in patients presenting with dysphagia. Pathologies such as achalasia and pseudoachalasia can be diffi cult to distinguish on barium swallow as typical fi ndings may not always be apparent. Recognising the various radiographic appearances by the radiologist is critical for prompt and accurate patient management. Imaging Findings: We present a case series of achalasia and pseudoachalasia on barium swallow encountered at our institution. We emphasise the differences between the two pathologies both on imaging and on text as a learning experience. We also provide a review of the existing literature with reference to our experience. Conclusion: Barium swallow is an established method for evaluating patients with dysphagia. However achalasia and pseudoachalasia still remain diffi cult to distinguish; so awareness of the potential pitfalls with endoscopic correlation in all cases is emphasised to avoid radiological misdiagnosis.",

Villous tumors are large masses fi lling the rectal lumen and displaying frondlike projections. Anorectal stromal tumors are large, well-marginated masses expanding the rectal wall and lack perirectal adenopathy. Lymphomas display marked concentric wall thickening engulfi ng the rectum, with luminal restriction but minor obstruction and adenopathies. Linitis and rectal metastases display a circumferential thickening of the rectal wall over a long segment. Other uncommon tumors include carcinoid tumor, melanoma, anal condyloma.

Defecography well assesses rectal prolapses, but does not provide imaging of muscles of pelvic fl oor except indirect signs. Dynamic MRI provides a whole and direct visualization both anatomical and functional of LAM and rectal prolapses.

Silvan; Santander/ES Learning Objectives: To describe the anatomy and imaging features of acquired anorectal fi stulas. To identify the MRI fi ndings in the various types of anorectal fi stulas. To review the role of MRI in the assessment of acquired anorectal fi stulas. Background: The most commonly encountered and known anorectal fi stulas are anorectoperineal fi stulas occuring in Crohns disease. However, there is a variety of less common fi stulas involving the anorectum. Their causes include infection, infl ammation, neoplasms, trauma and iatrogenic injury. Pelvic MRI assessment has proved useful in the evaluation of fi stulas and has become an important part of diagnostic work-up before proper case management. Imaging Findings: We illustrate the MR fi ndings in fi stulas involving the rectum or anal canal or ileal or colonic pouch (in case of previous surgery) and the vagina, uterus, prostate, urethra, bladder, and ileum. We also present the features of complex anoperineal fi stulas. The current role of MRI is discussed. We emphasize the role of MRI in the follow-up after medical or surgical treatment. Conclusion: Phased-array pelvic MRI is an accurate technique for the identifi cation of acquired anorectal fi stulas and their complications. MRI exam is a noninvasive diagnosis method that allows us an accurate diagnosis and follow-up in patients with anoperineal fi stulas. Imaging Findings: Small-bowel lymphomas are presented in wide spectrum of appearances included aneurismal dilatation, intra luminal polypoidal mass, mesenteric mass with irregular infi ltrating borders causing thickening of the walls and narrowing of the lumen and it may present just as diffuse circumferential mural thickening of the bowel walls with irregular narrowed lumen. MR SBFT offers the advantage of excellent soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capabilities and absence of ionizing radiation over other modalities in studying small bowel lymphoma. Over a 4-year period, we reviewed 260 MR SBFT examinations for evidence of small bowel lymphoma. In all, 14 cases were identifi ed and subsequently histologically confi rmed. We provide a detailed radiological review of the appearances of these tumors at MR SBFT. Conclusion: MR imaging of the small bowel has moved in the recent years and the knowledge of the typical MR SBFT appearance of small bowel lymphoma may aid the radiologist to suggest the diagnosis. Purpose: To evaluate using magnetic resonance the effi cacy of oral infl iximab therapy in perianal fi stulizing Crohn\u00b4s disease patients. To compare clinical and MRI fi ndings in these patients, using the perianal Crohn\u00b4s disease activity index (PCDAI) and magnetic resonance imaging-based score (MRS). To evaluate the effi cacy of MRI in the diagnosis and follow-up of this pathology. Methods and Materials: Patients with perianal fi stulas due to Crohn\u00b4s disease were enrolled into a prospective study, and were evaluated with pelvic MR previous to treatment and after a long-term follow-up of 24 months, in order to observe the evolution of fi stulous pathology. We use a 1.5 T system (Magnetom Avanto Siemens\u00ae) with a phased-array coil. We applied the MRS modifi ed from Assche to the images obtained. The clinical response was evaluated with the PCDAI described by Irvine. Results: Twelve patients were included in our study. Six (50%) achieved complete responses, verifi ed with both PCDAI and MRS. Five (41.6%) showed no changes in MRS with partial response in the PCDAI and 1 (8.3%) showed no response in both MRS and PCDAI. Conclusion: Oral Infl iximab is an effective treatment for patients with perianal fi stulas due to Crohn\u00b4s disease. MR is a good method for the diagnosis of the perianal Crohn\u00b4s disease and for the follow-up and evaluation of the treatment of these patients. The differences of the results in clinical and MR scores may be due to the subjective index that are evaluated in PCDAI and the \u00a8placebo\u00a8effect of the treatment.",

Procedure Details: Duplication, annular pancreas, malrotation and transient paraduodenal hernias are rarely seen congenital anomalies whereas diverticula may be seen more frequently. Infl ammatory wall thickening may arise from ulcers, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, Coeliac disease, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Duodenal dilatation may arise from superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Primary adenocarcinoma, paraganglioma, liposarcoma, GIST, lymphoma, Menetrier disease may cause noeplastic involvement of duodenum. Also, metastatic lymphadenopathies of seminoma, mesothelioma, lymphoma may locate around duodenum. Walls of duodenum may be thickened from adjacent malignancies such as cholangiocarcinoma, adenocarcinomas of stomach, colon and pancreas. Cystic extrensic compression may arise from choledococel, intestinal lympangiectatic cysts, choledochal cyst, pseudocysts, policystic disease.

Because of its rarity, diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Nowadays, the diagnosis of small bowel diseases is frequently made by MDCT enteroclysis. We present and discuss the typical fi ndings of MDCT enteroclysis in 6 cases. Background: Small bowel diverticulosis is a rare disorder found in 0.2-3% of the adult population. Most small bowel diverticula remain asymptomatic and are detected as an incidental fi nding, but they can also present a wide spectrum of complications, such as acute diverticulitis, hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, perforation, malabsoption, and present as diffi cult diagnostic challenge. Acquired small bowel diverticulosis predominantly involves the proximal jejunum, and is located on the mesenteric aspect of the small bowel, while the congenital Meckel diverticulum is located on the antimesenteric aspect of the ileum, 30-60 cm from the ileocecal valve.

In all the cases, multiplanar and curved planer reformatted images were performed. We evaluated mural thickening, mural enhancement, stenosis, praestenotic dilatation, perienteric reactions, lymph node enlargement. Results were compared with SBE and surgical fi ndings. Results: MDCT detected 26 lesions, and SBE showed 23 pathological lesions. The comparison with SBE showed 2 CT false-positive cases due to poor bowel distension. Three SBE false-negative cases were due to the small polipod lesions (< 10 mm). The fi nal diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 5 patients, carcinod tumor in 3 patients, Peutz -Jeghers poliposis in 1 patient, adenomatous polyps in 3 patients, lymphoma in 3 patients, leiomyoma in 2 patients, leiomyiosarcoma in 1 patient, CD in 6 patients and adhesions in 2 patients. We found enlarged lymph nodes in 13 patients, and liver metastases in 7 patients. MDCT fi ndings correlated well with the surgical fi ndings. Conclusion: MDCT enterography is a useful and reliable method for the diagnosis of small bowel tumors. Background: Adult small bowel intussusception has been regarded as a condition that always required surgery because up to 90% of the surgical reports said to be associated with a lead point abnormality. However, with the growing use of cross-sectional imaging in the evaluation of patients with abdominal complaints, the detection of enteric intussusception without a visible lead point disease has increased, creating a challenge in determining its diagnostic signifi cance and therapeutic approach. Imaging Findings: At CT, the presence of a bowel within bowel confi guration is pathognomonic for intussusception, having three different patterns depending on the severity and duration of the disease process. Intussusceptions without a lead mass are usually transient, small and non-obstructing. Experiments say they are due to disturbances in peristalsis and require only conservative observation. A lead point intussusception usually appears as a long abnormal target-like mass that may be associated with proximal bowel obstruction. Identifi cation of the lead mass is not always easy; however, once recognized, surgical treatment should be recommended. Conclusion: Incidental enteric intussusceptions are being increasingly diagnosed posing a new diagnostic and therapeutic problem. Not all this intussusceptions require aggressive work because most of them are intussusceptions without a lead point and therefore of no clinical importance. Therefore, it is important to know the imaging characteristics that permit the distinction between them to prevent unnecessary aggressive therapeutics. Results: Side effects of the oral application of mannitol were noted in four cases (one case of vomiting and three cases of mild diarhea), no serious complication was present. The evaluable images with suffi cient distension of the bowel loops were obtained in 92 cases. Signs of activity -mucosal and submucosal enhancement of thickened bowel wall -with or without fi stulisation were found in 41 cases, non-active CD in 22 cases (including 4 cases of stenosis), ulcerative colitis in 5 cases, enteritis in one case and normal fi nding in 31 cases. Conclusion: MR enterography with 2.5 mannitol is a safe valuable imaging tool and should be used as the prime imaging modality in patients with suspected or known CD. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between tumor blood fl ow calculated with perfusion CT and clinicopathological status of gastric cancer.",

The lymph nodes were counted, the largest diameter of each node was measured, and each node was analyzed for metastatic involvement by histologic examination. The frequency of metastatic involvement was calculated and correlated to lymph node size. Results: A total of 1253 lymph nodes were present in the 31 specimens examined for this study. A mean number of 40 lymph nodes (range 20-53) were found in each specimen. Of these 1253 nodes, 922 (74%) were tumor-free and 331 (26%) contained metastases. The mean diameter of the lymph nodes free of metastases was 4.1 mm, whereas that of nodes infi ltrated by metastases was 6.0 mm (p <.0001). Of the tumor-free lymph nodes, 735 (80%) were less than 5 mm in diameter, whereas 182 (55%) nodes containing metastases were less than 5 mm in diameter. Of the 10 patients without lymph node metastases, 7 had at least one node that was 10 mm or greater in diameter; similarly, 15 (71%) of the 21 patients with node metastases had at least one node that was 10 mm or greater in diameter. Conclusion: Lymph node size is not a reliable indicator for lymph node metastasis in patients withgastric cancer. Purpose: Physiological FDG uptake in the stomach is often seen, especially at the oral end. Water ingestion just before scanning would make stomach distention and thin the gastric wall, which may lead to apparent reduction of uptake in area of stomach. In this study, we assessed whether gastric distention using water ingestion suppressed physiological FDG uptake in the stomach. Methods and Materials: Forty patients who had FDG whole-body PET imaging for cancer screening followed by gastric endoscopic examination were registered in this study. All patients took 400 mL of water for hydration and were administered 185 MBq of FDG intravenously. All patients were randomly divided into two groups with or without (additional) water. With water group, 20 patients had additional 400 mL of water immediately before PET imaging. The stomach regions were classifi ed into three areas: U (upper)-area, M (middle)-area, L (lower)-area. The degree of FDG uptakes in these three gastric regions were semi-quantitatively evaluated using SUV. Results: Without water group, the mean SUVs in the U-, M-, L-areas was 2.43\u00b10.11, 2.31\u00b10.11 and 2.13\u00b10.13 respectively, while in water group, 1.94\u00b10.16, 1.84\u00b10.16 and 1.84\u00b10.18, respectively. With water group, the SUV in the U-and M-area were signifi cantly lower than that of without water group (P <.05). A signifi cant difference in FDG uptake was not observed among the three gastric areas in water group (P <.05). Conclusion: Additional water-intake immediately before PET imaging suppressed the physiological gastric FDG uptake. Therefore, decrease of physiological stomach accumulation with this method has a possibility of improving diagnosing in this area. Learning Objectives: To be aware of the importance of fat stranding in locating the abdominal urgent pathology. To be familiar with the differential diagnoses depending of the fat stranding location. To differentiate the benign entities that resemble life-threatening diseases. Background: CT plays a crucial role in differentiating the underlying causes of the symptoms in acute abdomen. Fat stranding is a CT sign that helps in the evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain in emergency radiology. It is no patognomonic though it warns us where to look at. Fat stranding may arise from many causes that should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Acute conditions that cause fat stranding include appendicitis, ischemia or perforation of the bowel, cholecystitis, trauma and surgery. Imaging Findings: We have made a pictorial review showing and describing the CT imaging features of the most common abdominal urgent pathology. We try to demonstrate how fat stranding on abdominal CT can help us to identify the crucial point of the acute abdominal at fi rst sight. Once localized it, we describe the specifi c imaging fi nding that will lead us to a fi nal diagnosis. Correct non-invasive diagnosis is important because treatment approaches for these conditions range from monitoring to surgery. We show some key-facts to help us to differentiate both groups. Conclusion: Fat stranding is a useful sign to localize the underlying pathology in acute abdomen. Knowledge of CT signs accompanying it helps us to reach a fi nal diagnosis, and therefore a more accurate clinical decision.",

Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to decrease morbidity and mortality. CT has become the primary modality for the imaging of these patients. However, radiological signs can be subtle and should be regarded as complementary to meticulous clinical assessment. Imaging Findings: CT fi ndings in bowel and mesenteric injury include the following: a. direct fi ndings of bowel injury: bowel wall disruption and oral contrast extravasation. b. direct fi ndings of mesenteric injury: intravenous contrast extravasation from mesenteric vessels. c. indirect fi ndings of bowel injury: free intraperitoneal/retroperitoneal air or fl uid. d. indirect fi ndings of mesenteric injury: diffuse bowel wall thickening, diffuse bowel wall enhancement, mesenteric infi ltration or haematoma. When indirect fi ndings of bowel or mesenteric injury are the only CT fi ndings, the need for surgical intervention is highly dependent on clinical judgment and can be necessary reassessment with CT 6-8 hours after the initial evaluation to elucidate the signifi cance on such fi ndings.

The cause of ISIGO has been not established; it has been postulated that precipitating factors resulting in displacement of the omentum, such as sudden increase in abdominal pressure after heavy meals, overexertion, a sudden change in body position, coughing or sneezing, may cause venous stasis and thrombosis leading to omental edema and congestion, with hemorrhagic necrosis and extravasation of serosanguineous peritoneal fl uid. Imaging Findings: All typical imaging features of ISIGO are well recognizable on unenhanced CT scans; they include a well circumscribed, oval or cake-like fatty mass with heterogeneous attenuation, containing strands of soft tissue attenuation probably corresponding to fi brous bands and/or dilated thrombosed veins. The mass is usually right sided and most often located deep to the rectus abdominis muscle and anterior to the colon. It appears adherent to infl amed, thickened parietal peritoneum. There is frequently a small to moderate amount of free peritoneal fl uid. Major differential diagnoses include appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, epiploic appendagitis and, less frequently, primary benign or malignant neoplasms or metastatic peritoneal seeding.

To make the reader aware of the clues to a diagnosis and of the imaging features of complicated intussusception. Background: Intussusception is the herniation of one segment of the gastrointestinal tract into another (proximal to the former or, more frequently, distal). In adults, intussusception usually has a leading cause and may develop at different levels with a variety of clinical presentations. We illustrate all X-ray, US, colour-Doppler, CT, and MRI fi ndings in adult intussusception of the stomach, the small bowel, the appendix, and the large bowel. We report cases of obstructing, subacute, chronic, and even transient intussusception. We highlight the clues to a diagnosis and potential pitfalls.

Background: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal. These cells express a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor KIT (CD 117), which has resulted in the advent of targeted molecular drugs such as imatinib. Imaging Findings: Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of GISTs. The majority of GISTs appears as large exophytic, heterogeneous enhancing masses on CT because of internal necrosis, haemorrhage or cystic degeneration. Although, defi nitive diagnosis relies on histopathology, imaging can be suggestive of the diagnosis, and plays an important role in the detection of complications and identifi cation of metastases. Differentiation from other primary gastrointestinal tumours can often be made on the basis of these specifi c fi ndings.

Background: Disorders involving the inguinal region can often be clinically diffi cult to assess. The advent of ultra-high-frequency probes has improved our ability to image the inguinal canal. However, a good understanding of the sonographic anatomy is fi rst required to prevent misdiagnosis. Imaging Findings: In this exhibit, we will document the required sonographic technique as well as common pitfalls encountered, followed by a detailed description and illustration of the sonographic anatomy of the inguinal canal. The structures described include the superfi cial and deep inguinal rings (and their boundaries), the walls of the inguinal canal, the inguinal ligament and the contents of the inguinal canal. Conclusion: We have described the ultrasound anatomy of the inguinal canal to enable sonography of this area as a dynamic, non-invasive and inexpensive method of evaluating disorders of this region. Retroperitoneal air was not uncommon in duodenal ulcer perforation (4 cases). Renal infection was also responsible for the presence of pneumoretroperitoneum (5 cases) with or without the formation of abscesses. Pancreatitis was responsible in 7 patients for the presence of air in the form of abscess or emphysematous pancreatitis. Conclusion: Trauma is by far the most common cause of retroperitoneal air collections, the second most frequent being perforation of a hollow organ such as duodenum, ascending or descending colon. Other conditions may also produce small amounts of retroperitoneal air and they have to be taken into account for a proper diagnosis, especially in diabetics or in immunocompromised patients.",

Learning Objectives: To present typical appearances of peritoneal, omental and mesenteric diseases and to narrow the differential diagnosis for each morphological pattern. Background: The causes of peritoneal, mesenteric and omental diseases could be divided into four major groups: infectious, infl ammatory, neoplastic, and vascular. The morphological changes in this anatomical region can be classifi ed into three basic patterns: solid well-defi ned masses (including cystic masses), ill-defi ned irregular masses and infi ltrative processes of the mesenteric and omental fat. Procedure Details: Abdominal and pelvic MDCT was performed with oral and/or intravenous administration of contrast material. The area between the diaphragmal dome and inguinal ligament was scanned. In each patient, the homogeneity of abdominal fat, the presence, attenuation and enhancement of the intraperitoneal mass, the surface and enhancement of parietal peritoneum, and the presence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy and ascites were analyzed. Conclusion: Peritoneum, omentum and mesentery can be affected either by primary pathologic conditions, or secondary by direct extension from adjacent organs, lymphatic and hematogenic dissemination, and peritoneal seeding. On the basis of clinical fi ndings and imaging appearance, the broad differential diagnosis of diseases in this region could be signifi cantly narrowed. The possible presence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy, peritoneal thickening and/or ascites can make the fi ndings more conspicuous. Learning Objectives: To illustrate radiological manifestations of the causes of obscure GI bleeding. To aid the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding. Background: Up to 5% of patients with recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding will remain undiagnosed by standard gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is considered obscure when conventional investigations (esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy) fail to detect bleeding lesions. On average, 27% of patients with obscure GI bleeding have small intestinal lesions. The causes of obscure GI bleeding include Arterio-venous vascular malformation, angiodysplasia, ectopic varices (duodenal, jejuno-ileal, colonic, and peristoma varices), small bowel lipoma, small bowel stromal tumor, cholesterol crystal emboli, aortoenteric fi stula and radiation enteritis. Diagnosing these lesions is frequently diffi cult because they tend to be inaccessible to routine endoscopy. Imaging Findings: Using multidetector-row CT scanner, well-designed barium study, and angiography, we illustrate the various radiological fi ndings of obscure GI bleeding caused by splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, ectopic varices, arteriovenous malformation, and angiodysplasia.",

Background: Lymphomas are malignant disorders of lymphoid tissues which are subdivided into two broad groups: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lymphoma classically presents in lymph node sites. Extra-nodal involvement may also be due to regional spread of nodal disease or haematogenous dissemination. The classifi cation of lymphoma is complex and still debated. The stage of the disease is classifi ed according to the Ann Arbor staging system. Imaging Findings: We reviewed all of radiological reports in the last fi ve years in our institution. We selected the cases with primary extra-nodal lymphoma and they were reviewed by two radiologists who were unaware of radiological fi ndings. We encountered 48 cases of primary extra-nodal lymphoma: Thoracic: lung (7) and pleural (2); Abdominal: gastrointestinal tract (10), abdominal viscera (6), urologic and genital tract (5), peritoneum (1); Musculoskeletal: bone (3), muscle (2), skin B D E F A G and subcutaneous tissue (1); Nervous system: brain (5) and spinal cord (1); Other: salivary glands (2), breast (2) and thyroid gland (1). Conclusion: Extra-nodal manifestations of lymphoma are greatly diverse and may mimic a variety of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, depending upon the site of involvement. Familiarity with the broad spectrum of primary extra-nodal lymphoma is important for enhancing lesion detection and improving diagnostic accuracy. Multimodality imaging plays a critical role in detecting, characterising and staging the disease.",

SP is characterized by thickening of the peritoneum that encloses some or all of the small intestine, which could result in bowel obstruction and necrosis. Imaging Findings: This exhibit illustrates abdominal CT fi ndings of conditions related to CAPD focusing on SP. Other conditions associated with CAPD are also discussed. We retrospectively reviewed abdominal CT of 48 patients on CAPD for more than 7 years. Findings of SP were peritoneal thickening, peritoneal calcifi cation, located fl uid collections, and small bowel abnormalities. The most serious complication of SP was associated with bowel perforation in 1 case. Other conditions such metastatic calcifi cation of soft tissue and joints due to renal osteodystrophy and vascular abnormalities such as atherosclerosis were also well depicted. In addition to axial images, we utilized opitimal multiplanar sections to visualize the entire peritoneal cavity. Conclusion: CT is an important tool in the diagnosis of SP and other conditions associated with CAPD.

Procedure Details: The DCT scan depicts vibrant site of implant better than x-plan radiography, with lower X-ray dose compared to CT. For cochlear implants, a single x-plan by Stenvers projection can directly visualize the electrodes in the cochlea. All patients with brainstem or inferior colliculus implants underwent postoperative CT scan (12 hours) to exclude complications, and to assess correct implantation. The follow-up of these implants can be done only by x-plan radiography. Conclusion: CT and DCT scan could provide a reliable and relatively fast method to precisely determine the location of middle ear implants; we prefer DCT in regards to CT because of the lesser X-ray dose administered; a single radiography is enough to visualize and follow-up brainstem or inferior colliculus implants. Learning Objectives: To outline the specifi c questions to the radiolgist with regard to cochlear implantation. Background: Cochlear implants are intended for patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Successful cochlear implantation depends on a variety of factors, including an intact cochlear nerve and a surgically accessible route for electrode placement. Therefore, imaging evaluation consists a major part of the preoperative assessement. Procedure Details: Twenty-eight patients, aged from 2 to 72 years who were candidates for cochlear implants were referred for imaging evaluation. All patients had severe SNHL of various causes. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were performed most on single-detector CT scanner using the classic protocol. MRI scans were acquired from a 1.5 and 1 Tesla scanners with an axial high-resolution two-dimensional or three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo T2-weighted sequence or 3D gradient echo (Ciss or True FISP). Non-enhanced and enhanced T1-weighted images through the temporal bone and axial fl air images through the brain were taken as well. Twenty-four patients had both CT and MR examinations. These were reviewed based on a detailed analysis of known anatomical landmarks and variants related to the procedure. Conclusion: CT is superior ino studying the bony structures of the inner ear and middle ear cavity and the course of the fallopian canal for surgical planning, whereas MRI is superior in analyzing the soft tissues of the inner ear and the vestibulocochlear nerve.

The purpose of this work is to clarify radiological anatomy and variants of the frontal sinus and its ways of drainage and to show the importance of imaging in the investigation of this region. Methods and Materials: 100 patients presenting a sino-nasal infl ammatory disease were investigated between 2004 and 2006 (complicated acute or chronic sinusitis, mucoceles, sino nasal polyposis). They benefi ted all of a sinus endoscopic exam and a scanning of the facial massif containing an axial study and coronal, sagittal and curvilinear reconstructions in the plan of the fronto-nasal tract. Results: Imaging in these patients confi rmed diagnoses evoked clinically, permitted the study of complications, notably frontal sinusitis and the exact study of the fronto-ethmo\u00efdal complex anatomy and its ways of drainage. Anatomical detailed CT boards and various pathological correlations are presented. Conclusion: Imaging especially when realized according to a rigorous technique is an indispensable tool in the diagnosis of complications of the frontal sinusitis and in the anatomical study before surgery. Results: CT showed a solid unilateral tumour (n=19), or bilateral (n=1), developing with the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses and extending to the maxillary sinus (n=14), and to sph\u00e9no\u00efd and frontal sinuses (n=5). It is associated with bone erosion (n=12) and bone condensation (n=2). MRI showed a heterogeneous and lobulated tumour (n=16), and allowed categorizing patients according to the staging proposed by Krouse: 1 case of stage1, 6 cases of stage 2, 7 cases of stage 3, and 2 cases of stage 4. Association with epidermo\u00efde carcinoma was noted in only 1 patient. Conclusion: Inverted papilloma is a rare benign tumour of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is locally aggressive. CT and MRI assessment can accurately predict the extent of the tumour. Preoperative staging by MRI may be useful for planning an appropriate surgical approach.

A head coil was used. 0.6 mm thick slices without interslice gap were obtained in axial plane using three dimensional fast imaging employing steady state acquisition (FIESTA) sequence without enhancement. Oculomotor nerves were observed in oblique-axial and oblique-sagittal planes acquired with MPR. Results: Both oculomotor cranial nerves (CN3) were demonstrated well in oblique-axial and oblique-sagittal planes in 19 normal subjects (95%) except one. 32 abducens (CN6) of 40 nerves (80%) were displayed in oblique-sagittal planes. 25 trochlear nerves (CN4) of 40 (62%) were showed. Different degree hypoplasia of motor nerves, especially CN6, was exhibited in CFEOMs: all CN6s were very thin, in which 1 nerve could be seen normally coursing, 1 not found, and 4 traced superiorly among which 2 coursed to ipsilateral CN3. The 4 CN3s were strikingly small and 2 normal. The onsets of 4 CN4s were shown well and 2 not. Conclusion: All ocular motor nerves can be seen in the subarachnoid cisterns by using 3D-FIESTA.

Methods and Materials: 284 cases of radiation examination for eye injuries occurred during conduct of military operations were analyzed. The ultrasound diagnosis with the help of high-frequency probes by transorbital approach was formed. During investigations, the possibilities of color Doppler were used and eye anterior section was examined with the help of water boluses in different modifi cations. Results: US method allowed developing the classifi cation groups of eye combat injuries, the US diagnostic syndromes and the radiation examination algorithm. The US high diagnostic informative capacity was noted in differentiation of retinal detachment; vascular tunic and vitreous body; in visualization and topical diagnosis of any intraocular foreign bodies more than 1 mm in size; in diagnosis of intraocular and retrobulbar hemorrhages and their sequelae. It also appeared effective in diagnosis and prognosis of development of infl ammatory posttraumatic changes in the eye based on the analysis of ratio blood fl ow velocity in retinal central artery/orbital artery; the degree of posttraumatic subatrophy and its development; in lens dislocation and change in its transparence. US is the method of choice in cases of \"hydrodynamic\" rupture of sclera and orbital osteal walls during eye severe contusion and in stab wounds. Conclusion: Complex US is a universal method for evaluation of structural changes in the eye after combat injuries that can be used for screening, pathologic process verifi cation under conditions of multi-purpose institution and for dynamic follow-up of treatment results.

Purpose: The usefulness of 123I-IMP for the diagnosis of orbital malignant melanoma is well recognized, but the estimation of the uptake is sometimes diffi cult because the images acquired 24 hours after injection may be so faint that the ROI we draw becomes arbitrary. We evaluated a new semiquantitative procedure to estimate more easily and objectively the uptake of 123I-IMP in patients with orbital malignant melanoma. Methods and Materials: First, we obtained the normal MRI image of the brain, standardized by the fusion software included in Neurostat. The standard ROIs were determined from the several slices for the orbit, and then they were adjusted to the standardized SPECT image of the 123I-IMP. The uptake was calculated by VOIClassic including the Neurostat system. Twenty patients with orbital tumor were assessed. We compared the uptake of the affected side of the orbit. Retention Index was calculated with decay correction. Retention Index= (delayed ratio-early ratio)/early ratio x 100 (%). Results: It was possible to distinguish the melanoma from the other orbital tumors without the fusion image of the co-registered MR and SPECT images. When we set the cut-off level at RI\u2265100, sensitivity was 85.0%, specifi city was 86.7%, and accuracy was 85.7%. Conclusion: Semiquantitative parameters calculated by VOIClassic including the Neurostat system are useful and provide an objective method for the diagnosis of orbital malignant melanoma. Learning Objectives: To establish the key radiologic fi ndings to enable the differential diagnosis between craniofacial involvement of Paget disease and of fi brous dysplasia. Background: Paget disease and fi brous dysplasia are 2 bone disorders, with frequent craniofacial involvement, in which imaging studies play a very important role in orienting the diagnosis and planning appropriate surgical treatment. Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal developmental anomaly of the bone-forming mesenchyme that usually affects young people, with craniofacial involvement in up to one third of the cases. Paget disease is a bone formation/resorption disorder that normally affects people over 40 years of age, with craniofacial involvement in up to 60% of cases. Like fi brous dysplasia, Paget disease can present different radiologic patterns in function of the stage of the disease. Imaging Findings: We reviewed 10 cases of Paget disease and fi brous dysplasia with bone involvement on craniofacial CT seen in our hospital. The key features to consider in the differential diagnosis between craniofacial involvement due to Paget disease versus fi brous dysplasia are: a) whether or not bone involvement is symmetrical, b) whether or not it crosses sutures, c) the bone pattern, and d) the presence or absence of disease in the paranasal bones.",

Learning Objectives: To understand the pleomorphic presentation of retrobulbar hematomas, occurring after cranio-facial trauma, the radiologic techniques to investigate them, and the principal features useful to achieve the differential diagnosis. Background: Retrobulbar hemorrhagic lesions can be classifi ed in two groups: intraorbital hematoma and subperiosteal hematoma. Subperiosteal hematomas represent a rare but well-defi ned clinical entity; they are more frequently seen in children, due to the loose adhesion of periostium in these patients, which can be easily detached from orbital bones by a hemorrhagic mass, with resultant proptosis and compromise of the optic nerve. Infrequently, this kind of retrobulbar hemorrage can be associated to the presence of an extradural intracranial hematoma; and this condition is known as a real diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Diagnosis relies on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). Imaging Findings: Anatomy and radiologic anatomy; classifi cation; MR and CT features; cases series. Conclusion: CT and MR allow a correct classifi cation, and provide critical information to the surgeon for mandatory treatment.",

Katada; Toyoake/JP Learning Objectives: To demonstrate three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) images of the whole temporal bone, the mastoid cavity, the tympanic cavity, the auditory ossicles and the inner ear. To correlate multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) sections in various angles with 3D-CT images. To identify four specifi c sections of the ossicles, the images of which are reconstructed to allow viewing of the ossicular chain. Background: Recent advances in multislice CT (MSCT) have made it possible to obtain high-resolution isotropic volume data, allowing us to generate 3D-CT images of the temporal bone, in which small structures and intricately shaped ossicles are depicted clearly. Furthermore, we have been able to reconstruct two-dimensional (2D) sections of the temporal bone, even the ossicles, from any desired direction with MPR without diffi culty. Therefore, it has become possible to recognise an object that has small and complicated structures with 2D-3D correlation. Procedure Details: MPR and 3D-CT source data from a volunteer were acquired by a 0.5-mm, 4-row MSCT system, using a unique high-resolution image reconstruction algorithm. MPR sections showed conventional axial, coronal planes and four specifi c sections of the ossicles, which we have identifi ed for the purpose of viewing the ossicular chain. Each structure has been indicated on both MPR and 3D-CT images and correlated with each other. Conclusion: High-resolution MPR and 3D-CT images with MSCT depict the complicated anatomy of the temporal bone. 2D-3D image correlation and recognition helps to deepen understanding of conventional 2D sectional anatomy, and to identify the optimal section for observing a given object. On the lower compartment, the anterior was cochlea nerve foramen which had spiral shape, and the posterior was inferior vestibular nerve foramen. The position of single foramen is uncertain, usually located on in-posterior of IAC fundus. In abnormal group, 9 ears were shown as IAC fundus disorder and foramina absent, only 1 foramen was shown in 1 ear, 2 foramina in 4 ears, 3 foramina in 2 ears, 4 foramina in 2 ears; Abnormal shape of cochlear nerve foramen was seen in 4 ears, spiral shape disappeared completely in 2 ears, small round shape was shown in 2 ears. Conclusion: Three dimensional imaging can improve the understanding and comprehension of IAC fundus. CTVE is useful in showing the normal structures and pathological changes of IAC fundus.",

Because of its higher signalto-noise ratio (SNR), EPI-DWI was obtained with a thinner slice thickness and a higher spatial resolution than that of FASE-DWI. Image quality of EPI-and FASE-DWI was judged from: 1) contrast of the lesion, 2) image distortion and abnormal signal secondary to susceptibility artifacts, and 3) anatomical correspondence with other images. Results: A cholesteatoma was correctly identifi ed as an area of obvious hyperintense signal on EPI-DWI and FASE-DWI in 15/21 (71%) and 18/21 (86%), respectively. Among the six lesions that were missed on EPI-DWI, fi ve lesions were smaller than 5 mm. In 15 patients whose cholesteatoma was correctly diagnosed on the EPI-and FASE DWI, SNR of the cholesteatoma and cerebellum, and contrastto-noise ratio of the cholesteatoma to the cerebellum was not signifi cantly different between the both sequences. Image quality of EPI-DWI was judged inferior to that of FASE-DWI in 12 patients mainly because of susceptibility artifacts.

Unilateral atresia was found in 30 cases: 1-bony EAC atresia; 5 -EAC atresia with normal sized middle ear; 10 cases had ossicular deformities but normal mastoids, 11 unilateral atresia cases had ossicular deformities and hypoplastic mastoids, thick atresic plate and no ossicles was found in 5 cases.

Combined inner ear Mondini deformity was found in 1 case. Anteriorly located descending facial nerve canal was noted in 12 cases. Conclusion: High-resolution computed tomography is the most important preoperative test in patients with congenital aural atresia and evaluation of the changes in middle ear, otic capsule, ossicles, mastoids, temporo-mandibular joint, facial nerve canal for providing reconstructive and cosmetic operations. Although it has been described as a \"relatively common\" benign neoplasm, study of the literature reveals that the incidence is not very high. It is a slow growing, vascular lesion seen more often in middle age females. Usually it is not detected until an imaging study is performed for other reasons. Although OCA is histologically benign, it can displace intraorbital structures, and cause optic nerve compression or increased IOP. Painless, gradually progressive proptosis and visual disturbance are the main clinical signs. Imaging Findings: Ultrasound when performed will reveal a smoothly marginated round or oval, hypoechoic lesion with presence of internal fl ow with color-Doppler. Computed tomography demonstrates a hyperdense intraconal lesion, with marked homogeneous contrast enhancement. Commonly orbital bone expansion is seen. Calcifi cation is rare. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the lesion appears isointense to muscle on T1W1 and hyperintense on T2W1. It displaces the optic nerve without infi ltrating it. The IV administration of contrast material causes enhancement of the lesion. Conclusion: Knowledge of the radiological appearance in cases of OCA is mandatory for its correct characterization, thus, facilitating optimal treatment.",

We compared the ADC value obtained before the treatment with the one obtained after the treatment. Intera Achieva 1.5 T Nova Dual system (Philips Medical) was used for the examination. The EPI-based diffusion-weighted imaging sequence with SPIR fat suppression was applied at the settings of 2 b-values, namely 0 and 1000 sec/mm 2 , respectively. Results: Average ADC value for all clinical cases were 0.897\u00d710 -3 (S.D.: 0.142\u00d710 -3 ) at pre-treatment and 1.355\u00d710 -3 (S.D.: 0.573\u00d710 -3 ) at post-treatment.

We point out the locations where one should search for these lesions. We analyze the results of the different imaging techniques. Conclusion: CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) allow prompt and accurate diagnosis of traumatic vascular lesions, which is crucial in the prognosis of these patients and ensures their correct management. Conventional angiography remains the gold standard for the confi rmation of these lesions and enables an endovascular treatment, but is costly and not optimal as a screening technique, and is not exempt of serious neurologic complications. The use of non-invasive techniques (CTA and MRA) for the initial assessment of vascular lesions is growing rapidly. These techniques offer several advantages: they are non-invasive, less resourcedependent, and allow simultaneous evaluation of extravascular structures. ",

Numerous lesions can affect the gnathic bones, including odontoma (compound and complex), ameloblastic fi bro-odontoma, calcifying odontogenic tumor (Pindborg tumor), odontogenic myxoma, cementoblastoma (cementoma), ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, and dentigerous cyst. The diagnosis of these processes can be tricky because of non-specifi c imaging features, atypical clinical presentation, and lack of familiarity with certain abnormalities. Imaging Findings: Radiography, the modality most often used for initial evaluation, can be helpful for detecting cortical destruction. However, CT is more sensitive than radiography for detecting calcifi ed tumor matrix and cortical destruction. CT also provides delineation of the anatomic extent of the lesion, and can guide biopsy. In addition to imaging fi ndings, patient history, physical examination and histologic analysis are required to reach the correct diagnosis.",

In the gnathic bones, a group of such lesions includes Paget's disease, brown tumor, infl ammatory disease, aggressive infantile fi bromatosis, cleidocranial dysplasia, fi brous dysplasia, leukemia, multiple myeloma, maxillary sinus carcinoma, juvenile angiofi broma, and metastatic disease. Although several of these conditions share some clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics, they do have very different treatments and prognoses. Imaging Findings: Although the imaging features of many lesions mimicking odontogenic tumors are non-specifi c, knowledge of the typical radiologic manifestations of odontogenic tumor-mimicker lesions often enables their differentiation from odontogenic tumors, and occasionally allows a specifi c diagnosis to be suggested. Osseous expansion, an aggressive characteristic, may occur with non-malignant conditions, such as Paget's disease. Similarly, a rim of bone sclerosis around a lesion is a non-aggressive characteristic that, in rare circumstances, is present in malignant neoplasms. Furthermore, local infl ammation is frequently associated with poorly demarcated osteolysis and periostitis, fi ndings that resemble those of a malignant tumor. Conclusion: Although aggressive lesions are commonly malignant and benign tumors are commonly non-aggressive, this is not uniformly true. Consideration of certain imaging fi ndings of a lesion within the gnathic bones can narrow the broad differential diagnosis. ",

The method of obtaining cytology locally is hybrid, both freehand and ultrasound guided. The aim of this study was to determine which is the most successful at providing an early diagnosis. Methods and Materials: One hundred and ninety nine consecutive patients undergoing thyroid fi ne needle aspiration (FNA) during a two year period (July 2004-July 2006) were included in a retrospective review. Cytology was classifi ed as: (1) diagnostic or (2) non-diagnostic by a cytologist. Freehand accounted for 29% (58/199) of samples, whilst the remaining 71% (141/199) were obtained by ultrasound guidance. Results: Diagnostic samples were obtained in 77% (154/199) of patients. This corresponds to a diagnostic yield of 62% (36/58) in the freehand FNA group compared with 84% (118/141) in the ultrasound guided FNA group. Comparison of predicted versus observed events was performed with a chi-squared statistic of 9.78 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Obtaining cytology by an ultrasound guided method is statistically signifi cantly more successful (p < 0.001) and should be the primary diagnostic technique in avoiding a delay in diagnosis. CT scans were obtained before and after the contrast medium administration (delay of 30 and 80 sec), with a thickness of 2.5 mm, and a reconstruction interval of 1.25 mm. CT fi ndings were compared to surgical results. Results: CT examination resulted positive in 35 cases, negative in 15 cases and doubtful in 10 cases. 40/60 patients underwent surgery: surgery identifi ed 39 lesions (37 adenomas, 2 primary hyperplasia); in 2 cases surgery was negative, while in 8 cases the lesions interested an ectopic parathyroid gland. Surgery confi rmed CT evaluation in 23/35 positive cases; in 8/10 doubtful cases, surgery confi rmed the location of the lesion in 5 cases, in 2 cases the lesions resulted to be ectopic, while in 1 case surgical exploration resulted to be negative. In 9/15 cases with negative CT fi ndings, surgery identifi ed the lesion in 8 cases, while 1 case resulted to be negative. The sensitivity and specifi city values results were 78% and 25%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 73%.

Malignant thyroid nodules show a variety of Doppler patterns that should be known in order to prompt further evaluation (cytology). Procedure Details: Malignant nodules usually appear hypervascular, although hypervascularity is not specifi c for malignancy. Conversely, absence of vascular signal is highly predictive of benign nature. A complete vascular halo around a nodule is highly predictive of its benign nature. Absent vascular halo and intranodular vascularity are not specifi c for malignancy, but a combination of absent halo, microcalcifi cations, and intense fl ow is signifi cantly specifi c for its malignant nature (although insensitive). Spectral analysis has a limited practical value. Lymph nodes, node-to-vessel relationship, and jugular vein thrombosis can be evaluated. Lymph nodes usually demonstrate peripheral vascularization with irregular signal distribution and alternated hypervascular and hypovascular intranodular areas.

Nagamachi 1 , S. Fujita 2 , K. Kamimura 2 , R. Nishii 1 , S. Futami 1 , S. Tamura 1 ; 1 Kiyotake-cho/JP, 2 Miyakonojo/JP Purpose: Preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands in patients with hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is important. Previously, we reported a direct comparison study using 99m Tc-sestamibi (MIBI), 99m Tc-tetrofosmin, and 201 Tl. In our previous study, 99m Tc-MIBI and 99m Tc-tetrofosmin were equally useful and they were more useful than 201 Tl. Recent reports have shown the usefulness of 11 Cmethionine positron emission tomography (PET), but the role of 11 C-methionine is not well known. We directly compared the detectability for localization of abnormal parathyroid glands using 11 C-methionine PET, 18 F-fl uorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and dual-phase 99m Tc-sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy to clarify the usefulness of 11 C-methionine PET. Methods and Materials: Seven patients (3 men and 4 women), 6 primary HPT and 1 secondary HPT, were evaluated. We performed 11 C-methionine PET, 18 F-FDG PET, and dual-phase 99m Tc-MIBI scintigraphy on all patients and directly compared the detectability. They were operated and confi rmed histologically. Results: In 6 patients with primary HPT (6 adenomas), 5 patients (83.3%) were correctly localized by 11 C-methionine and dual-phase 99m Tc-MIBI scintigraphy. But 18 F-FDG PET could detect only 1 of the 6 patients (16.7%). In 1 patient with secondary HPT, 11 C-methionine PET and dual-phase 99m Tc-MIBI scintigraphy could detect 2 of the 4 abnormal hyperplastic parathyroid glands (50%), but 18 F-FDG PET could not detect abnormal parathyroid glands. Conclusion: In our preliminary study, 11 C-methionine PET and dual-phase 99m Tc-MIBI scintigraphy are equally useful for localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands, but 18 F-FDG PET is not satisfactory for the localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. Purpose: We study peripheral lymph (cervical, axillary and inguinal) nodes features in order to differentiate malignant adenomegalies from hypertrophic-reactive nodes. Methods and Materials: We practised high resolution ultrasonography with 7.5-13 MHz lineal probes in 100 patients (56 women and 44 men). The ages ranged from 7-78 years (mean age 51.4 years). Results: 300 nodes were observed, with 181 benign and 119 malignant nodes. 130 benign nodes (71.8%) had oval shape (Vasallo index \u22651.8) and echogenic centre. 21 benign nodes (11.6%) were oval, without central refringence. 20 nodes (11%) had kidney-like shape with echogenic centre. 98 benign nodes (54.1%) showed central arterial signal associated with intranodal vascular branching. 67 nodes (37%) showed central vascular signal alone. In 139 nodes (76.8%) there was low resistance (IR< 0.75) arterial signals and 19 nodes (10.5%) showed high resistance Doppler signals (IR \u2265or 0.75). 77 malignant lymph nodes (64.7%) appeared rounded (Vasallo index < 1.8) without central echoes, heterogeneous and hypoecoic. 12 nodes (10.1%) were kidney-shaped, hypoechoic. 27 nodes (22.7%) were rounded, with eccentric echoes. 82 malignant nodes (68.9%) showed lateral vascular signals without central vascular signals; in 16 nodes (13.4%) a central vascular signal was recorded. 67 malignant nodes (56.3%) showed high resistance vascular signals. In 28 adenopathies (23.5%) the arterial signals were of low resistance. There was no Doppler signal in 13 malignant nodes (10.9%). 10 neoplastic nodes (8.4%) showed vascular intranodal branching. Conclusion: We can combine morphologic and vascular nodal features to differentiate accurately between malignant lymph nodes and hypertrophic-reactive nodes.",

We retrospectively reviewed the day after disease onset, cumulative dose of intraarterial, and intravenous administrated these drugs at that time. Cumulative intraarterial administrated doses, intravenous administrated, and total administrated doses were calculated. These factors were compared with outcomes that included mortality rate, periods of admission of the hospital and the intensive care unit (ICU), periods that individual laboratory indexes indicated abnormal level. Spearman rank correlation was used for statistical analysis. Results: Each CRAI was started within 72 hours after the onset on thirty-three patients (91%). The mortality rate was 2.4%. Cumulative intraarterial administrated doses of nafamostat mesilate for the early stage had signifi cant correlation with normalization of CRP (p=.033) and periods of admission of ICU (p=.035). Cumulative intraarterial administrated doses of IPM/CS for the early stage had signifi cant correlation with normalization of CRP (p=.042). There was no correlation between other parameters and outcomes. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased dosage of intraarterial administration of nafamostat mesilate, and IPM/Cs at the early stage may reduce the period of high risked condition of acute severe pancreatitis.

HVPG before and after the procedure was measured. All patients underwent color-Doppler and laboratory exams after 48 hours and 1, 3, 6 months. After 6 months an angiography was performed. Results: In 9 procedures, 19 stents were placed. In 4 patients, a transcaval puncture was needed. HVPG reduced from 24+6 mmHg to 11+2 mmHg (p < 0.001). After a medium follow-up of 15 months, 8 patients are alive, 1 dead 3 days after the emergency TIPS procedure. 2/8 patients had an early occlusion, resolved with thrombolytic therapy. 7/8 shunts are still open at color-Doppler and angiographic study; all these patients had clinical and biochemical improvement. Only 2 patients (22%) developed a transitory encephalopathy. Conclusion: TIPS with 8 mm PTFE-covered stents obtained a good technical, clinical and hemodynamic success, at a medium term follow-up, with a lower incidence of transitory encephalopathy compared to 10 mm stents. There was no statistical difference in the clinical tumor response between the two groups. There was also no statistical difference in overall survival rates (P=.7770) between the two groups.

Therefore, a variety of retrievers are now under investigation, but still not satisfactory, since recanalizazion rates by the retrievers alone only reach 50%. Therefore, we evaluated a novel mechanical recanalisation technique -remote bilateral simultaneous vertebral thromboaspiration -to enhance the effect of retrievers in distal basilar artery embolism.

They were treated with bilateral or in case of occlusion or hypoplasia of the contralateral vertebral artery (VA) unilateral proximal thromboaspiration during the use of different retrievers or even without the use of a retriever.

Symptomatic relief of symptoms by IVC stenting has been described as an effective means of palliation.

Diagnosis was made using contrast-enhanced CT or gadolinium-enhanced MRI. All 6 patients had disease involving the IVC adjacent to the renal veins. Using standard techniques, self-expanding stents were used to traverse the stenosis. All patients were monitored post-procedure with ultrasound to establish patency and regular serum creatinine levels to ensure the renal function did not deteriorate. Results: There was a signifi cant symptomatic improvement in leg swelling following stenting in all of the treated patients. Follow-up imaging demonstrated no delay in renal contrast enhancement. There was no signifi cant increase in serum creatinine levels. Conclusion: IVC stenting for the treatment of lower limb swelling due to malignancy is an effective palliative method of reducing symptomatic lower limb oedema due to intra-abdominal malignancy and can probably be safely carried out without concern for renal function compromise. Further studies are warranted. Results: Technical success was obtained in all 15 patients; in control group, technical success rate was 86%.

Background: Cerebral ischemic stroke is the 3 rd leading cause of death and the 1 st cause of disability in the developed countries (Europe 650.000 deaths/year, EUSI 2003) with a heavy fi nancial and social cost. The establishment of an effective treatment is a very important medical and social issue. Procedure Details: Intraarterial thrombolysis is effective when there is still viable brain tissue. Patient selection is based on the therapeutic window since the symptoms onset, on the lack of clinical and imaging exclusion criteria and on the imaging confi rmation of occlusion of cerebral artery. The imaging protocols with CT-CT perfusion mad MR diffusion-perfusion are discussed, as well as the modifi cation of the time window according to the imaging fi ndings. The therapeutic approach is either intraarterial, with the use of thrombolytic medicine, either combined with intravenous infusion (i.v. glucoprotein inhibitor \u0399\u0399b/IIIa).

Each patient had exploratory angiography, which included the study of the internal (ICA) and external carotid arteries (ECA) on both sides with selective injections in the branches of the ECA. The fi ndings were classifi ed as 1. Active bleeding 2. Pseudoaneurysm and 3. Others. The abnormal vessels were embolized. Results: 12 of the patients had abnormalities in the internal maxillary artery. Of these, three patients showed active bleeding into the ethmoidal sinuses. Other nine showed pseudoaneurysms in the distal branch closely related to a sinus. In all these cases, the vessel was embolized with PVA particles. One patient had active bleeding from the ophthalmic artery since the external carotid artery was ligated at an other center and could not be embolized. In another patient, bleeding was from a pseudoaneurysm arising from the internal carotid artery, which was embolized by occluding the ICA. In one patient, the angiogram was normal and both the internal maxillary arteries were embolized with Gelfoam. None of the embolized patients had recurrent epistaxis.

Cessation of hemoptysis was achieved with a single BAE (n=24, 61.5%), whereas either continuing or recurring hemoptysis was observed after 15 BAEs. However, after repeated BAEs, all hemoptysis stopped. Conclusion: The cessation of hemoptysis was achieved by BAE in all cases, although some were achieved by repeated BAEs.

Purpose: To evaluate the effi cacy and safety of a hybrid treatment for severe deep-venous thrombosis by combining clot aspiration, mechanical thrombectomy, and local fi brinolytic therapy. Methods and Materials: Within a period of 5 years, 45 patients with severe deep venous thrombosis were treated with hybrid interventional procedures. After insertion of a temporary vena cava fi lter, thrombo-aspiration with a PTCA guiding catheter and/or mechanical thrombectomy with OASIS or modifi ed rotating pigtail catheter system were performed. Additionally, continuous local fi brinolytic therapy and balloon PTA/stenting were performed, if needed. The primary endpoint was venographic fi ndings of thrombus extraction. Systemic thrombolysis and anticoagulation therapy followed. Results: Trans-femoral interventional radiological therapy was achieved in 42 patients. The approach was ipsi-lateral in 22 cases and contra-lateral in 20 cases. Interventional techniques were as follows: manual clot aspiration 37,OASIS thrombectomy 13, mechanical thrombus fragmentation using a modifi ed pigtail catheter 3, balloon PTA 3, stenting 4, and continuous local catheter fi brinolytic therapy 16. Successful venographic recanalization was achieved in 37 of 42 patients. A temporary vena cava fi lter was easily removed 9.2 days after the insertion in 37 patients.

However, severe complications such as splenic abscess, gastritis, or pancreatitis may limit the indication. In order to reduce these risks, two different methods of PSE were introduced using the MRXO. Procedure Details: Prior to PSE, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) including blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) images were performed for the splenic volumetry using a 1.5 Tesla MR machine. After the celiac and superior mesenteric arteriography, splenic arterio (SpA) CT was obtained to evaluate the splenic or pancreatic branches. Segmental PSE (s-PSE) using microcoils with gelfoam particles or Lp-NBCA, or peripheral PSE (p-PSE) using microspheres were performed following the exclusion of gastric and pancreatic branches. Splenic ischemic range was evaluated on BOLD images during the procedures and pursued up to 60-70%. Conclusion: A control splenic volumetry was semiautomatically obtained using a workstation based on DWI. SpA-CT allowed easy recognition of gastric and pancreatic branches and the exclusion before PSE. The ischemic foci shown on BOLD images immediately after the procedures corresponded well to the non-enhanced area on CT one week later. Although p-PSE produced multifocal infarctions and may theoretically disturb abscess formation, the volumetry of ischemic (infracted) tissue is better evaluated on s-PSE than p-PSE. The MRXO is useful for safe and effective PSE.",

The radiological appearance of carcinoids varies depending on their size, location, and on their variable biological behaviour, and can often be very diffi cult to diagnose. Imaging Findings: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging of histologically proven carcinoid tumours in our institutions for the last fi ve years. The clinical symptoms are varied and the diagnosis can be made biochemically or histologically. Imaging is playing an ever-increasing role not only just in the diagnosis, but also in the treatment using percutaneous techniques. Cases highlighted include carcinoids presenting as acute gastrointestinal bleeding and multifocal intra-abdominal masses. Endovascular treatment appearances such as transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) with CT correlation pre-and post-procedure are also presented. Conclusion: Carcinoid tumours can have variable and unusual clinical and imaging presentations. Familiarity with their appearance on imaging can be helpful for radiologists to avoid misdiagnosis and for initiation of proper treatment. Interventional procedures have an increasing role in both diagnosis and treatment, leading not only to effective control of symptoms, but may also help prevent potentially dangerous complications.",

However, these authors stressed several drawbacks to this technique, including possible increased bleeding, limited role of ultrasound guidance, and inherent risks in CO 2 insuffl ation. We offer a new approach in using a balloon catheter as a diaphragmatic protective device.

Spin-echo T1-weighted images (T1WI), fast-spin-echo T2-weighted images (T2WI), Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI) and echo-planar-imaging-diffusion-weighted images (DWI) (b=50, 500, 1000 sec/mm 2 ) were obtained.

Results: VX2 without RFA showed ring-shaped FDG accumulation and hyperintensity on T1WI, T2WI, CE-T1WI, and DWI, while ablated lesions showed less accumulation and hypointensity on all sequences. ADC values and T/M ratios of VX2 without RFA were 1.69\u00b10.35 \u00d7 10 -3 mm 2 /sec and 11.6\u00b13.2, respectively.

Learning Objectives: To review the equipment and practical use of ultrasound relevant to the practice of regional anesthesia. To show the sonographic anatomy of the areas most frequently involved in regional anesthesia, and to become familiar with the imaging appearance of nervous structures. To describe and illustrate the sonographic appearance of peripheral nerves. To discuss the advantages of ultrasound-guided plexus and nerve blocks. Background: The ultrasound guidance for nerve block was fi rst reported by La Grange et al in 1978, but the interest has increased in the last 10 years due to the technological advances experienced in ultrasound and regional anesthesia. An optimal distribution of local anesthetic around the nerve structures is the key requirement for successful regional blocks, and ultrasound allows direct visualization in real time. Ultrasound-guided regional blocks improve the quality (faster onset and duration), reduce the performance time and complications, and minimize the amount of local anaesthetic used. Procedure Details: It is essential to know the specifi c anatomy and the sonographic correlation of the areas usually involved in the regional blocks of the upper (interscalene, infraclavicular, axillar, and peripheral blocks) and lower extremities (femoral, sciatic, popliteal blocks). We describe and illustrate the technique used in our hospital by the department of anesthesia in collaboration with the radiology department. Conclusion: Utilization of ultrasound guidance for regional blocks is on the rise and has demonstrated to be an alternative to traditional methods of regional anesthesia.

Conclusion: For ultrasound guided procedures to be carried out successfully and safely require visualisation of the needle. This diffi cult task can be simplifi ed by considering some applied physics and following some simple tips.",

Background: The thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies and pedicles differ in size and shape according to level. The method of accessing the vertebral bodies for percutaneous management of vertebral compression fractures and for biopsy has typically been via the parapedicular approach in the thoracic spine and the transpedicular approach in the lumbar spine. While the transpedicular approach is safe and effective, the ability to redirect the needle is limited, and there is a risk of fracturing the pedicle itself. Procedure Details: The parapedicular approach does not have the risk of pedicular fracture and the needle is more easily redirected with this approach, but the neurovascular structures are important to identify and avoid. The needle is placed in at the pedicle-body junction along the superior half of the pedicle and is directed toward the contralateral inferior vertebral endplate. The medial wall of the pedicle must not be transgressed prior to entering the posterior portion of the vertebral body.",

The tumors, 3 of the mediastinum and 9 of the lung, were adjacent to the aorta (7 cases), pulmonary artery (4 cases) or heart (3 cases) with potential thermal damage of these structures. All ablations were performed with a multitined expandable electrode under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Vital signs of the patients 446 B D E F A G were non-invasively monitored continuously. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT after 1 month; the absence of tumor enhancement CT image was considered to indicate complete tumor necrosis. Two patients were re-treated. In a patient, an electrode is penetrated in the pericardium. Results: In all cases, the procedure was technically successful. No intraprocedural arrhythmia occurred. Morbidity existed in 3 cases of pneumothorax and 1 case of asymptomatic thickening of the pericardium. In the control CT after 1 month, there was complete necrosis in 7 cases and partial (from 70 to 90%) in the remaining 5 cases. Conclusion: RFA of mediastinal and lung tumors adjacent to the heart and large vessels is feasible and safe because the blood fl ow causes a \"heat-sink\" effect adjacent to such structures and prevents undesired thermal damage.",

Fenster; London, ON/CA (allisoncanada@hotmail.com) Purpose: The speed of accurate ultrasound (US) guided biopsy is dependent on operator experience. We developed a needle guidance system (NGS) to increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy procedures using US. This system is composed of a passive articulated mechanical arm attached to an US transducer, providing real-time projected needle pathway overlay guidance. This NGS coupled to a CNB needle will result in accurate biopsy with shorter procedure time than those of freehand technique, thus potentially limiting the US biopsy operator dependence. Methods and Materials: Biopsy targets composed of 2.5 mm blue PVAC lesions were implanted within chicken tissue test phantoms. Two radiologists experienced with US-guided biopsy and 3 inexperienced radiology residents performed biopsy of these lesions using both the free-hand technique and NGS (45 lesions per technique per participant). Participants were alternately assigned to start with 1 of the 2 biopsy methods, which were video recorded and analyzed for procedure time. Biopsy samples were examined for the presence of blue color, which was indicative of a successful biopsy. Results: Biopsy procedure time using the NGS was signifi cantly lower than the free-hand technique (p < 0.001). The average procedure time was shorter among experienced participants than among inexperienced participants when using the free-hand technique (p=0.037). Equivalence in procedure time was found when physicians, both experienced and inexperienced with free-hand US biopsy, performed biopsy using the NGS (p=0.734). Conclusion: Our needle guidance system is increasing procedural effi ciency by improving the rates of successful biopsy and reducing the required physician experience to perform biopsy.",

In this study, \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3specifi c ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) was generated and its potential to distinguish tumors with different angiogenic profi le was investigated. Methods and Materials: APTMS-coated USPIO with diameters of 10\u00b13 nm were conjugated with RGD-peptides. RGD-USPIO or plain particles were injected into nude mice bearing HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 and A431-tumor xenografts. T 2 -and T 2 *weighted MR imaging and T 2 -relaxometry were performed 6 h after injection. Tumor tissues were immunostained against CD61 and counterstained against CD31. Area fractions of CD31 and \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin positive vessels were determined. Results: On T 2 *-weighted images, a strong heterogeneous decrease in signal intensity was found in HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 tumors, while signal changes in A431 tumors were more homogeneous and less pronounced. Both in HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 and in A431 tumors, T 2 -relaxation times decreased signifi cantly (p < 0.05) more after the injection of RGD-USPIO than after the injection of plain particles. In addition, the decrease in T 2 -relaxation time in HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 tumors (28 \u00b1 41 ms) was stronger than in A431 tumors (14 \u00b1 8 ms). In line with the MR results, histological evaluation shows in HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 tumors a heterogeneous vascularization with areas of high vessel density and large mature vessels. Contrarily, in A431 tumors, the vessels were small and homogeneously distributed. Furthermore, in HaCaT-ras-A-5RT3 tumors, signifi cantly (p < 0.01) higher area fractions of CD31 (1.9\u00b11.1%) and \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin positive vessels (1.0\u00b10.5%) were found than in the A431 tumors (CD31/\u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin area fraction: 0.9\u00b10.4%/0.3\u00b10.1%).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of ECRI as molecular imaging. Methods and Material: Fifteen patients with histologically confi rmed invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast were studied. We adopted the off-resonance technique for preferential saturation of the immobile protons to evaluate the ECR values. The single saturation transfer pulse frequency was employed at the frequency 5 ppm downfi eld from the water resonance. The ECR value was defi ned as the percentage of signal loss between the unsaturated and saturated images. The ECRI was constructed on the basis of the percentage of ECR. The 50 ROIs had a rectangle-sampling area of 0.3 mm 2 . The Winroof software was used to analyze the number of cells.",

Methods and Materials: Forty-two MR exams were executed with intravascular contrast media in 21 rats: in 7 rats, tumors were induced by the subcutaneous injection of colon carcinoma cells, and in 14 rats by mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Perfusional and permeability parameters of the implanted tumors were evaluated with two contrast media (B22956/1 and Gd-DTPA37-albumin) to depict better the tumoral response after administration of two different antiangiogenic drugs (Tamoxifen and SU6668). By means of these parameters and histological examination, it was possible to obtain a map of the microcirculation. Results: In all the examined animal models, the DCE-MRI shows that the enhancement is greater in the peripheral area than in the central area. After the antiangiogenic drug administration, the mean values of permeability and perfusion were decreased to 51% and 59%, respectively. The response to the treatment is different for each antiangiogenic drug. Different contrast media allow a different capability to visualize the microcircle. Conclusion: DCE-MRI permits the non-invasive evaluation of tumoral microcirculation, and in particular, of its size, dynamic characteristics and vascular grade before and after antiangiogenic treatment.",

Caseiro-Alves; Coimbra/ PT (pombas@gmail.com) Learning Objectives: To provide an educational and pictorial review of the radiological imaging features (plain radiography/ bone scintigraphy/CT/MRI) and distribution of eosinophilic granuloma (EG). To illustrate the clinical features and peculiar radiological appearances of eosinophilic granuloma. To discuss differential diagnoses, in particular in differentiating eosinophilic granuloma from other primary bone tumours, metastases or osteomyelitis. Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a pathological entity characterized predominantly by proliferation of a specifi c histiocyte (Langerhans cells). The etiology and pathogenesis is still unknown. Eosinophilic granuloma is the unifocal unisystem form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, typically characterized by bone involvement, usually in a monostotic pattern. Nonetheless, it is important to be able to recognize this lesion and exclude diffuse involvement, particulary of the bone marrow, lungs, heart, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, conferring an adverse prognosis. EG must be differentiated from neoplastic, infl ammatory and metabolic lesions, which have variable approaches in terms of prognosis and treatment. Eosinophilic granuloma may resolve spontaneously. There are good results with intralesional injection of methylprednisolone. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are reserved for disseminated or complicated cases, which is rarely the case of EG. Imaging Findings: We divide our presentation by anatomical location, showing lesions of the calvarium, mandible, ribs, vertebra, and long bones, emphasizing the most important aspects in differential diagnosis, in different imaging modalities. Conclusion: Awareness and early identifi cation of eosinophilic granuloma allow appropriate management. We provide a review of the background, clinical presentation and radiological feature of eosinophilic granuloma. Purpose: MRI, radionuclide imaging and bone densitometry have been used for quantifying skeletal involvement in patients with Gaucher disease (GD). In this study, we compared different quantitative/semiquantitative methods for assessing skeletal involvement in patients with GD based on MRI, scintigraphy or dual-energy X-ray adsorptiometry (DEXA).",

MRI was performed with 1.5 T scanner; protocol included T1 and T2w TSE sequences of lumbar spine and femora. All images were analysed by 2 radiologists and bone marrow changes were classifi ed on a 16-point semi-quantitative scoring system. 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy was semiquantitatively scored; DEXA of the lumbar spine and femoral neck yielded the Z-and T-scores. The relationship between MRI, scintigraphic and DEXA scores and different disease parameters (bone pain, skeletal complications, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, platelet count, haemoglobin level, and plasma chitrotriosidase) was evaluated by the Spearman's rank correlation test. Results: A statistically signifi cant correlation was found between MRI and scintigraphic scores (r = 0.694; P = 0.0001). Moreover, both imaging scores were statistically signifi cantly correlated with several clinical parameters including platelet count, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, haemoglobin level and presence of skeletal complications. On the contrary, the DEXA-derived parameters were not correlated with any clinical and/or imaging scores. Conclusion: Our preliminary data indicate that both MRI and 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy are reliable tools for assessing the severity of bone marrow involvement in patients with GD. Learning Objectives: To describe the clinical, pathological and radiological features of osseus tumours that contain osteoclast-like giant cells. To understand the pathologic basis of the radiologic features of these lesions. To realize the problems and pitfalls in the pathology assessment and discuss the clinical and radiological features that may allow differential diagnosis. Background: Differential diagnosis of bone lesions that contain giant cells requires the pathologist to consider an important number of possibilities. Each lesion should be analyzed as a clinicopathologic entity and, therefore, the pathologist should be aware of the relevant clinical information and the radiologic evaluation of the lesions. Procedure Details: We have divided these lesions into two groups. The fi rst one includes lesions that can be mistaken for a benign giant cell tumor (BGCT) because of its histologic similarity or its location in long bones extremities (chondroblastoma, giant cell reparative granuloma, cherubism, brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism and intraosseus nodular synovitis). The other group consists of lesions that also contain giant multinucleated cells but are histopathologically very different from BGCT (osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma, osteoid osteoma, fi brous dysplasia, condromixoid fi broma, cemento-ossifying fi broma, aneurysmal bone cyst, fi brous histiocytoma, eosinophilic granuloma and Paget disease) Conclusion: The radiologist's role is essential to diagnose and treat osseus tumours that contain osteoclast-like giant cells, because it allows differentiation between them and informs about its biologic potential. Periostic reaction, borders, soft tissue mass and calcifi ed matrix are the best radiological features that are helpful in differential diagnosis. Location and patient age are the best clinical clues.",

Patient population was stratifi ed into men and women younger or older than 50 years, and SIT curves were compared among these subgroups. Multiple regression analysis of data was performed to investigate the effect of age and sex. Results: Perfusion of the upper lumbar spine was signifi cantly higher compared to the lower level (p < 0.05). Individuals younger than 50 years showed signifi cantly higher perfusion compared to older ones for both spinal levels. Women demonstrated signifi cantly increased perfusion compared to men of the same age in the upper lumbar spine only. All parameters except time to peak showed a moderate linear correlation with age (0.22<r< 0.32, p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed age as the most signifi cant factor (p < 0.05) as compared with sex. To understand the pathologic basis of the radiologic features of these lesions. To highlight that anatomopathological fi ndings and radiological features are essential to reach a correct diagnosis. Background: Some vascular lesions of bone are relatively commonly encountered by radiologists, but are uncommonly seen by pathologists. Patients can present with different symptoms and signs and while some tumours manifest as clearly benign, others have non-specifi c imaging features that may simulate malign neoplasms. In addition, sometimes pathology cannot easily differentiate between benign and malign lesions. Imaging Findings: Among a wide sample of vascular bone tumours from our pathologic and radiologic database, the most representative examples have been selected to illustrate their main radiological and pathological characteristics. Each tumour has been described and assigned to one of the two groups: benign or malignant. The most illustrative diagnostic images have been chosen from various imaging techniques (in particular, X-ray, CT and MR) and their subsequent anatomopathological images. The benign tumours that have been reviewed are: hemangioma, cystic angiomatosis, glomus tumor and Gorham's disease. The malignant tumours that have been analyzed are: hemangioendotelioma, ephitheloid hemangioendothelioma and angiosarcoma. Conclusion: After interacting with this exhibit, the radiologist will have an enhanced understanding of vascular bone tumors, including the histopathologic and radiologic features. Both diagnostic tools are crucial to distinguish these lesions and to allow their proper management. ",

Additionally most cases underwent image guided ablation in our department and therefore biopsy results and long term follow-up were also accessible. Cases were included in our analysis when at least CT scan images were available for review. For each case, we precised the exact distribution within the skeleton, and within the bone both longitudinally (e.g. epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphyseal) and transversally (e.g. cortical, cancellous, subperiosteal). A typical imaging pattern was defi ned for each location. Results: A total of 158 osteoid osteomas were included in our analysis. Distribution in the skeleton was as follows: upper limb (21 cases), spine (21 cases), femur (63 cases), tibia (28 cases), and remaining of the lower limb (25 cases). We were able to defi ne at least one typical imaging pattern in all major bones. Conclusion: Recognition of typical imaging patterns in most bones allows a more confi dent diagnosis of osteoid osteoma with CT scan. Conclusion: WBLD-MDCT represents a reliable diagnostic tool for the assessment of multiple myeloma, allowing not only the detection of typical lytic bone lesions, but also of both medullary and extra-medullary myeloma involvement. Medullary involvement was encountered in all stages of the disease, including patients without osteolysis, and was associated with signifi cantly elevated levels of \u00df2-microglobulin, a prospective prognostic marker. Therefore, we suggest the inclusion of WBMD-CT into the diagnostic workup of MM patients.",

Of these, 15 suffered from multiple myeloma, 14 had a known primary tumor, 2 suffered from lymphoma and 23 presented with acute back pain without medical history. Results: In patients with multiple myeloma, quantitative analysis was able to differentiate between active disease (mean ADC 0.62) and response to therapy (1.25). In 4 patients without medical history, the evaluation of the ADC maps led to an investigation for a primary tumor. In 10 patients with a known primary tumor, the ADC fi ndings were attributed to metastases (mean ADC 0.61), while in 4 of them an osteoporotic fracture was found (1.65). In 10 patients out of 54, quantitative analysis added critical information that changed the therapeutic strategy. ADC values were not signifi cantly lower in tumor infi ltration (0.62\u00b10.21) than in normal bone marrow (0.77\u00b10.35). Conclusion: DWI with ADC calculation, a method that studies bone marrow pathology on the basis of altered water-proton mobility, has been proved to be a useful tool (in adjunction to the other available conventional sequences) for differentiating between benign and malignant processes of the spine, and may increase the diagnostic potential of MR imaging in the assessment of spinal lesions.",

Background: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most common inherited haemoglobinopathy. This haemolytic anaemia is characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (RBCs), which are removed from the circulation and destroyed by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to anaemia. However, more signifi cantly, the sickled RBCs cause vascular occlusion, leading to tissue ischaemia and infarction. Patients with SCA are at an increased risk of infection due to abnormalities in host defences and functional asplenia. SCA affects multiple organs, with the clinical manifestations of SCA being predominantly due to anaemia, vaso-occlusion and infection. Imaging Findings: The fundamental skeletal abnormalities consist of marrow hyperplasia, which leads to osteopaenia with a coarse trabecular pattern. In severe cases, medullary cavities are obliterated giving the appearance of generalized increased bone density. Bone infarction secondary to vaso-occlusion is the hallmark of SCA. In adults, it affects the ends of long bones, the central portions of vertebral bodies with typical 'H' shaped vertebrae and the femoral and humeral heads, resulting in avascular necrosis. In older children, the diaphyses of long bones are the site of predilection. Areas of bone necrosis are susceptible to superadded infection, especially from salmonella.",

Results: MR accuracy was 88% for the medial and 85% for the lateral meniscus. Of 27 incorrect MR diagnoses, 12 (44%) were unavoidable, 10 (37%) were equivocal B D E F A G and 5 (19%) were interpretation errors. Of the 67 medial meniscal tears, 12 (18%) were missed. Eight (67%) of these 12 were categorized as equivocal, including 3 postoperative menisci. Of the 30 lateral tears, 12 (40%) were missed, 7 (58%) of which were categorized as unavoidable. Of these 12, 11 (92%) showed fraying of the inner edge, which led to minimal resection (n=7) or had minimal tear treated conservatively (n=4). There were 3 false-positive diagnoses, all occuring in the lateral meniscus, 2 of which were unavoidable and 1was an interpretation error. Conclusion: Of all missed lateral meniscal tears, most are unavoidable and related to confusion between what represents fraying and what represents a tear. Unavoidable false-positive diagnoses are infrequent and may be related to incomplete arthroscopic evaluation. Subtle equivocal fi ndings still make MR diagnosis diffi cult, even for experienced radiologists. Learning Objectives: Evaluate the imaging contribution in total hip replacement (THR) management. Background: Digital or plain fi lm imaging permits the diagnosis of a majority of THR complications. CT scan and MRI, usually less useful, are becoming better adapted due to the performance of the latest machines and specialized software. Imaging Findings: Main local complications are acute, consisting of implant fractures, joint dislocation and neighbouring bone fatigue fracture. Chronic complications include soft tissue new bone formation, periarticular tendonitis, bursitis, recurent dislocation and, above all, device loosening without infection due to granulomatous reaction or with intercurrent infection. In case of recurrent dislocation, X-ray or CT scan can be used to evaluate the actual position of the devices and the possible wear. Conclusion: Hip replacement surgery has been one of the most common elective and semi-elective orthopedic operations for the past 25 years. Radiography remains the mainstay of imaging evaluation of hip replacements. The various types of hip replacements can be recognized on radiographs, and many complications have specifi c appearances that the radiologist should be familiar with.",

Background: Imaging post-operative shoulders has always been a matter of debate, the main controversy being whether MRI or MR arthrography is the best means of answering diagnostic questions. Published data and clinical experience show that conventional MRI is effective in assessing full-thickness lesions, but less capable of differentiating partial lesions and normal fi ndings after surgery. Procedure Details: A number of factors may decrease the accuracy of MRI in evaluating post-operative shoulders, including iatrogenic artefacts, surgical distortions of native anatomy, changes in the signal intensity of tissues, and image degradation caused by metallic artefacts. We show the key points for optimizing post-operative shoulder MRI protocols and try to identify the best technical parameter among the most widely used pulse sequences.

Proximal femoral epiphyseal vascular occlusion was induced by maximal bilateral hip abduction for 2 hours. Dynamic Gd-enhanced MR imaging was performed in normal and abduction hips. For dynamic Gd-enhanced imaging, spoiled gradientrecalled echo images with a temporal resolution of 3.0s were performed, and a total of 96 images were obtained. The enhancement ratios (ER) in various regions of femoral heads were evaluated and correlated with histological fi ndings. Results: In normal hips, we found no signifi cant differences in the ER and the timing of enhancement between physeal cartilage and metaphyseal spongiosa (P> 0.1). However, in abduction hips, the ER of physeal cartilage was lower than that of metaphyseal spongiosa and enhanced more slowly than metaphyseal spongiosa (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ER of epiphyseal cartilage remained lower and enhanced more slowly than physeal cartilage (P < 0.001). The ER of physeal and epiphyseal cartilage in abduction was lower and enhanced more slowly than those in the normal (P < 0.001). More transphyseal vessels in abduction were found histologically than those in the normal (P < 0.005). Conclusion: With epiphyseal vascular occlusion, enhancement seems to advance from the metaphysis into the physis and epiphysis, the metaphyseal vascularity might contribute to epiphyseal and physeal perfusion.

To analyze the discordant fi ndings of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on sagittal and oblique coronal MR images of the knee, and correlate with arthroscopic fi ndings as the standard. Methods and Materials: One hundred thirty-eight MR images of the knee in patients with suspected internal derangement who subsequently underwent arthroscopic surgery were included. Two radiologists, unaware of clinical details, jointly evaluated ACL on sagittal T2, proton density-weighted images initially and then on oblique coronal images. Reviewers determined the status of ACL as intact (I), partial (P), or complete tear (C) respectively. When interpretation of ACL status was different between both imaging planes, cases were categorized as discordant and correlated with arthroscopic results. Results: A discordant MR fi nding of ACL was seen in 9 of 138 knees (6.5%). Correlation of ACL status on sagittal, oblique coronal images with arthroscopic fi nding was the following: C-P-P in 3, P-I-I in 2, C-I-I in one, C-P-C in 2, and I-P-C in one case. At arthroscopy, total rupture of ant-med bundle with partly intact post-lat bundle was observed in 3 C-P-P; displaced ACL by fat tissue in intercondylar notch and torn meniscal fragment, deformed course by ligamentum mucosum adhesion in 2 P-I-I and one C-I-I; fi brous scar in 2 C-P-C and one I-P-C.",

Background: Articular cartilage damage is extremely common in today's society. Osteochondral autotransplantation is a surgical technique that is being used increasingly in the treatment of symptomatic focal chondral or osteochondral defect. With more new surgical procedures being used to repair chondral defects, such mosaicplasty, there is an increasing demand for radiologists to evaluate these procedures. Procedure Details: There were 22 patients with focal chondral lesion (19 of the knee and 3 of the ankle) treated with mosaicplasty. Clinical examination, X-ray and MRI were performed on each patient before surgery. The mosaicplasties were normally done with arthoscopic and transferred autologous bone from the donor site to the recipient site into the cartilage defect. After the surgery, for the assessment of a cartilage repair procedure, we used MRI General Electric Signa Horizon LX 1.5 T with axial, coronal and sagittal planes with cartilage-sensitive sequences, such as fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo/proton densityweighted or 3D gradient echo sequences. We evaluated the number of plugs, the graft integration to the adjacent hyaline cartilage and bone, congruence of the articular surface, the adjacent bone marrow, the status of the graft donor site as well as associated complications. Conclusion: With its direct multiplanar imaging capabilities, excellent soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution, MRI could be the method of choice for non-invasive follow-up of patients after mosaicplasty.",

Background: Shoulder MR arthrography (MRA) is now a well-assessed technique based on the injection of contrast medium solution, which fi lls the articular space and fi nds its way between the rotator cuff (RC) and the gleno-humeral ligaments. In case of gleno-labral pathology or partial RC tears, we use an additional sequence that allows obtaining virtual arthroscopy post-processed views to complete the MR evaluation of shoulder pathology. Procedure Details: MR arthrographic sequences (SE T1w and GRE T1 FAT SAT) are provided with a GE 0.5 T Signa and the supplemental sequence is a 3D Spoiled GE T1w positioned in coronal plane. Virtual arthroscopy is performed by means of a dedicated software loaded on a work-station. Conclusion: Shoulder virtual arthroscopy may be useful in diagnostic accuracy, both as an adjunct to clinical and surgical planning, as well as an interactive tool for learning arthroscopic anatomy and pathology. Purpose: To assess the value of virtual arthroscopy of the shoulder. Methods and Materials: Forty patients with shoulder dislocation-translation and/or clinical signs of instability underwent 64 slices MDCT arthrography and virtual arthroscopic reconstruction. All scans were performed using 64-detector row helical CT scanners with following parameters: 200 Kv; 40 mA; thickness 0.6 mm; collimation 0.6; reconstruction increment 0.6 mm; matrix 512 x 512; preparation and acquisition time 10 min. The patients were examined in supine positions with the shoulder in neutral position; intra-articular injection was performed posteriorly, without fl uoroscopic control, administering 20 cc of room air. The data were downloaded to a workstation and virtual arthroscopy performed using a PC-based 3D reconstruction program. A surface rendering algorithm was employed for producing virtual arthroscopic images. Prior to applying the surface rendering algorithm, a threshold value was specifi ed, corresponding to the center of the different density between bony tissue (the brightest pixel) and soft tissue. Surface models then were calculated and displayed employing an imaginary light source Results: MDCT arthrography diagnosed 20 Bankart lesions, 5 Bankart osseous lesions, 5 cuff-rotator tears, 15 Hill-Sachs lesions and 2 SLAP lesions. Virtual arthroscopy detected and visualized all lesions above-mentioned; it provides a further point of view of shoulder joint which is useful for orthopaedic surgeons planning arthroscopy or arthrotomy; it may also serve as a simulation in the teaching of orthopaedic trainees.

Background: We retrospectively reviewed 937 consecutive patients treated with total or partial knee arthroplasty in the last two years; 34 (1.42%) patients (22 women and 12 men) presented patellar complications. Mean patient age was 74 years (range: 59-90 years). All underwent plain-fi lm radiography periodically. In determinate cases according to the clinical symptoms, patients underwent US. Imaging Findings: The most common patellar complications after total or partial knee arthroplasty were: fracture (n=9), instability (n=13), dislocation or luxation (n=4), osteonecrosis (n=5), infection (n=2), erosion (n=2), impingement on the prosthesis (n=3), patellar or quadriceps tendon tear (n=3), and loosening or rupture of the patellar prosthetic button (n=5).

Conclusion: Patellar complications following knee arthroplasties are generally uncommon but often of potential clinical signifi cance. Plain fi lms are essential for the evaluation of patellar complications after surgery and should be the initial imaging study performed.

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of sagittal fat-suppressed 3D SPGR imaging for detecting superfi cial cartilage defects of the medial femoral condyle. Methods and Materials: Fifty patients who had arthroscopically confi rmed cartilage defects by an arthroscopist and had MR imaging were included in this study. Sagittal fat-suppressed 3D SPGR MR images were retrospectively reviewed by a radiologist. Cartilage thickness was graded: Grade 0, normal; grade 1, abnormal signal without a contour defect; grade 2, less than 50% reduction of cartilage thickness; grade 3, 50% or greater reduction of cartilage thickness; and grade 4, full-thickness cartilage defect. Results: After arthroscopy, there were 68 cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyles: grade 2 (n = 21), grade 3 (n = 37), and grade 4 (n = 10). After fat-suppressed 3D SPGR imaging, cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyles were graded as follows: grade 2 (n = 26), grade 3 (n = 33), and grade 4 (n = 9).

Background: Direct MRA (dMRA) with injection of gadolinium (Gd) diluted in saline solution can be useful for evaluating certain pathologic conditions in the joints. It is most helpful in the shoulder; especially for outlining labral-ligamentous abnormalities and distinguishing partial-thickness from full-thickness tears in the rotator cuff; but it can be also useful in other joints, demonstrating labral tears in the hip, showing tears of the collateral ligament of the elbow, identifying residual or recurrent tears in the knee following meniscectomy, and assessing the stability of osteochondral lesions in the articular surface of joints. Indirect MRA (iMRA) can be done when dMRA is inconvenient, or not logistically feasible. In this case, the MR images are acquired after an intravenous administration of Gd-contrast media. Between April 2005 and August 2006, we performed 29 dMRA and 44 iMRA in our institution. Procedure Details: The direct arthrographies were perfomed using fl uoroscopy and ultrasound guidance and about 12-15 ml Gd-diluted solution was injected in the shoulder. Indirect MRA was done after 10 ml (0.5 mmol/mL) intravenous injection of Gd-contrast media (Dotaren \u00ae ,Guerbet Laboratories). All the examinations were performed in patients with rotator cuff, labral or SLAP lesions. Conclusion: Although iMRA is unable to fi ll the joint cavity, it does not require direct Gd-contrast media injection and it is superior to conventional MR imaging when there is minimal joint fl uid. In addition, intravenous injection allows demonstrating vascularized or infl amed tissue.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in evaluation of patellofemoral joint cartilage abnormalities. Methods and Materials:We evaluated 44 patellofemoral joints (43 patients) with MR imaging using a conventional knee coil and a microscopy coil; T2-weighted images and fat-saturated proton-density-weighted images were acquired respectively. Retropatellar cartilage was divided into 9 parts and femoral cartilage into 3 parts, where the status of cartilage was graded into 0 (normal) to 4 (full thickness injury). The diagnostic accuracy was analyzed using surgical or arthroscopic fi ndings as a standard of reference. Results: In 528 parts of cartilage, accuracy of MR grading using a microscopy coil and a conventional knee coil were 0.924 and 0.915, respectively, when grade 1-4 was considered to be positive, and 0.990 and 0.994, respectively, when grade 2-4 was considered to be positive. In 31 parts with grade-1 surgically confi rmed cartilage lesion (superfi cial lesions, soft indentation and/or superfi cial fi ssures and cracks), MR grading were correct in 9 with a microscopy coil and in 3 with a conventional coil. However, no signifi cant difference was seen statistically in the accuracy of both techniques. Conclusion: This preliminary study indicated that high-resolution MR imaging using a microscopy coil could be useful in detecting early cartilage abnormalities. Further study is required to obtain a statistically signifi cant result. Learning Objectives: 1) To describe the MR imaging fi ndings in the patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome. 2) To consider the patellar tendonlateral femoral condyle friction syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients with anterior knee pain. 3) To identify the patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome in order to make a correct treatment. Background: Patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome is a rare cause of anterior knee pain related to the clinical entity of fat pad impingement. MR imaging can reliable identify this entity, showing the soft tissue edema in the infrapatellar fat body in the anterolateral aspect of the patellofemoral joint. Imaging Findings: Retrospective review of MR images in 51 knees (48 patients) with antero-lateral knee pain and a focal area of abnormal signal intensity in the inferolateral aspect of the patellofemoral joint was performed. Patients with a meniscal tear or ligamentous injury were retrieved to exclude these facts as the cause of knee pain. Abnormal patellar alignment was demonstrated in 28 knees. Patellar tendinitis was noted in 8 cases. Patellar confi guration type III of Wiberg was found in 22 knees. Conclusion: MR imaging allows identifi cation of changes in patients with patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome that should be distinguished from other causes of anterior or lateral knee pain.",

Funabashi, S. Kishida, Y. Harada, H. Moriya, I. Komuro; Chiba/JP Purpose: To analyze the kinesis and morphology of the acetabular labrum (AL) non-invasively, we applied four-dimensional (4D) arthrography with motion-gated MSCT and compared the results with arthoscopy and Harris hip score (HHS). Methods and Materials: Forty-nine symptomatic patients (52 hips) underwent MSCT. Before CT acquisition, contrast material was injected into the hip joint. The subject performed reciprocating hip fl exion-extension at the same rhythm as a pulsation simulator. Then we performed mimic retrospective ECG-gating, that is \"motion-gated\", acquisition and were reconstructed to divide one movement into 10 segments. The kinematics and morphology of AL were evaluated on 4D fi lms and the fi ndings were classifi ed into three groups: stabilized, irregular, and eccentric motion. Hip arthroscopy was performed in 34 hips. Labral lesions were classifi ed into four groups according to morphologic features (intact, fray, tear, and detached). HHS was also calculated depend upon patient state at the examination. Results: Of 46 hips with adequate images, 15, 11, and 20 revealed stabilized, irregular, and eccentric motion, respectively. Of 16 without adhesive AL on arthroscopy, 6 had irregular (average 48 HHS) and 4 had eccentric motion (average 58 HHS) and HHS tend to be higher in the eccentric group than in the irregular groups on 4D CT. Conclusion: 4D arthrography of the AL applying motion-gated MSCT can reveal both kinetic and morphological changes of AL and can perform further stratifi cation in subjects with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons class 0, or 1 or without \"detached\" morphological fi ndings by arthroscopy.",

The implemented three-dimensional radial 23 Na MRI technique detected validly the tissue's sodium content. The acquisition time of 10 minutes and direct reconstruction of images and archiving them in PACS enabled a clinically feasible examination protocol. Imaging Findings: 23 Na MRI delivers reproducible data on sodium content within skeletal muscles. In various sodium channelopathies, 23 Na MRI detects intracellular sodium accumulation that is associated with muscle weakness and stiffness. Also, the benefi cial effects of blocking the pathologic sodium channels by a dedicated medication can be quantifi ed. Results of 23 Na MRI in vivo correlate signifi cantly to both electrophysiological in-vitro data of muscle fi bers derived from biopsies and muscle weakness in patients with sodium channelopathies.

Luleci; Antalya/TR (ealimoglu@akdeniz.edu.tr) Purpose: To investigate the correlation between sonographic fi ndings and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods and Materials: 118 wrists of patients with CTS symptoms were included in our study. After clinical examination and electrodiagnostic study (ENMG), sonography was performed in patients by a radiologist unaware of the physical examination and ENMG results. The wrists showing both positive clinical fi ndings and ENMG results were diagnosed as CTS. The cross-sectional area of median nerve was measured at the level of the psiforme bone in sonography and the measurements over 10 mm\u00b2 were accepted in favor of CTS. The disease was categorized into three groups according to ENMG Results: mild, moderate and severe. The difference between the mean sonographic area values of the three severity groups was investigated to estimate disease severity. Results: Fifty-four wrists had positive clinical examination and ENMG results. The mean area was 14.9\u00b15.7 in these cases. The median nerve area was measured under 10 mm\u00b2 in 7 cases. The sensitivity of sonography in the diagnosis of CTS was 87%. The mean area of the median nerves was 11.1\u00b13.4 mm\u00b2, 14.4\u00b14.5 mm\u00b2, and 19.2\u00b15.9 mm\u00b2 in mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively, and the difference between them was statistically signifi cant (p=0.000, Kruskal-Wallis analysis). Conclusion: The diagnostic usefulness of sonography in CTS has been clearly shown previously. However, little attention has been paid to the correlation between sonographic fi ndings and severity of disease. In addition to its high sensitivity in the diagnosis of CTS, sonography may also be helpful in estimating disease severity.",

Pathological changes of skeletal muscle perfusion can be found in various clinical diseases, such as degenerative or infl ammatory myopathies. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound allows for a sensitive detection of microvascularity in real-time. Quantifi cation of perfusion is achieved by analyzing replenishment kinetics of the contrast agent. Also, the effects of training schemes on muscle microcirculation can be assessed for separate muscle groups. Imaging Findings: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound delivers reproducible perfusion data in volunteers. CEUS visualizes exercise-induced hyperperfusion and can separate well-trained subjects from un-trained subjects. CEUS-derived perfusion results in vivo correlate signifi cantly to capillarization in biopsies from these muscles. Furthermore, CEUS detects increased microcirculation in histologically proven acute autoimmune myositis with comparable accuracy as MRI and additionally increases specifi city in diagnosis of myositis when a muscle edema -as such a non-specifi c fi nding -is evidenced by MRI.

Its histological subtypes are categorised as: well differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid, allomorphic and mixed type. Procedure Details: The lesions illustrated are identifi ed with relative ease on CT and MRI, due to the typical density/signal of the fat. Lipomas, however, can reveal small non-fat density/signal areas; in these cases vigilance is necessary. In malignant lesions, one can usually detect fatty areas that allow the diagnosis. In these cases, the non-fat areas, on which the biopsy is to be directed, are picked up with imaging. Special attention should be focused on the density/signal intensity in tumour nodules and septation. Myxoid liposarcomas have some particularity such as intramuscular position, pseudocystic aspect with peripheral enhancement, small solid nodules, or septa containing fat.",

Results: Five patients had a spontaneous recovery of RN paralysis. In the remaining 10, US identifi ed correctly RN morphology, thickness, structure and anatomical relationship, compared to surgical evaluation. RM was unable to identify the RN in 5 cases because of the metallic material artefacts. In traumatic and expansive pathologies, mean RN thickness was 4.4 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively; the ecographic structure was ipoechoic with loss of the fascicolated normal pattern in traumatic lesions while normal in expansive ones. Conclusion: US and MR are both useful for the diagnosis of RN pathologies. US is a dynamic, comparative and brief examination, useful when metallic material obstacles are used in MR evaluation.

It represents the most common of this group of lesions, both in its localized and its diffuse form. Procedure Details: We studied retrospectively 24 patients with GCTTS localized in hands (23 had a single tumor and the remaining patient had a multifocal involvement). Diagnosis was made by means of excisional biopsy. In all cases, plain fi lms and MRI were performed. Size, shape, localization and osseus involvement were analysed, as well as MRI characteristics such as signal intensity and contrast enhancement. Cases of relapse after surgery were also recorded. Regarding MRI, in T1 weighted images all tumors were homogeneous and isointense, but they were more heterogeneous and predominantly hipointense in T2. After intravenous paramagnetic contrast administration, a homogeneous enhancement was demonstrated. In all cases, gradient echo sequences showed very low intensity areas. Surgery was performed in every patient. In 6 of them, local relapse was detected. Conclusion: GCTTS is one of the most frequent soft tissue masses of the hand, second in frequency only to ganglion. We are obliged to suspect it in every case of hand tumor, specially if it is localized in the fi ngers. MRI is useful in the diagnosis due to the characteristic fi ndings of the tumor.",

The purpose of our study was to characterize the CT and MR fi ndings of pelvic BPNSTs. Methods and Materials: CT and MR images of 16 patients with a pathologically proven pelvic BPNST (11 neurilemomas and 5 neurofi bromas) were retrospectively reviewed. The following morphologic characteristics were evaluated according to tumor shape, size, position, margin, homogeneity and invasion into adjacent structures. When MRI had been performed, signal intensity and the pattern of enhancement were also assessed. Results: All 16 pelvic BPNSTs were round in shape, with well-defi ned margins; the mean diameter was 8.2 cm (4-13 cm); they were usually located in the presacral region (12/16). Tumors were typically heterogeneous with cystic change (11/16), but centrally massive cystic attenuation was more common in neurilemomas than in neurofi bromas (8/11 vs 0/5). In 2 cases, there was smooth expansion of a sacral foramen with marginal sclerosis (1 in each group). 7 patients underwent MRI, T2WI showed hyperintense cystic areas and solid areas of mixed intensity. On CT or MRI contrast-enhanced images, peripheral enhancement was apparent in 7 of 11 neurilemomas, whereas irregular enhancement was evident in 4 of 5 neurofi bromas. Conclusion: Both pelvic neurilemomas and neurofi bromas are typically round, large, well-circumscribed, heterogeneous tumors that are located in the presacral space. They can occasionally cause bony changes in the sacrum, but do not invade adjacent structures. Centrally massive necrosis or peripheral enhancement favors the diagnosis of a neurilemoma.

Infection must be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in case of a Charcot's spine with destructive lesions. Imaging Findings: Plain fi lms, CT and MRI with gadolinium injection are useful. This destructive process involves the disc space, the vertebral bodies and the facet joints. The thoracolumbar junction and lumbar spine are most frequently affected, and one or more vertebral segments may be involved. Sclerosis or osteolysis may predominate, and the spinal changes are often initially thought to be due to vertebral osteomyelitis or metastasis. Osseous fragments typically extend beyond the confi nes of the vertebral body margins into the musculature and the spinal canal. Bone debris and effusion may result in a paraspinous mass containing calcifi cations. However, solid epidural masses are typically lacking. The presence of vertebral body sclerosis and osseous fragmentation are further imaging fi ndings that help differentiate neuropathic spine from other processes. Conclusion: Background and imaging are suggestive of the diagnosis. Closed needle and even open surgical biopsies are often necessary to fi nally confi rm the Charcot's spine and exclude infection.",

To appreciate the effect of data acquisition parameters on the degree of artefact. To appreciate the effect of 3 different reconstruction kernels on the appearance of titanium metal artefact. To learn how to reduce the degree of artefact by altering MDCT scanning and reconstruction parameters. Background: Steel and titanium metals are commonly used in spinal surgery with signifi cant impact on post-operative CT image quality. The artefact is due to beam hardening and it appears as streaking with signifi cant change in local CT number values. The streaking artefact can seriously detract our ability to visualise pathology in proximity to the implant, for instance, nerve root irritation, remaining bone/disc protrusion. Procedure Details: Steel and titanium pedicle screws were positioned in a \"dry bone\" lumbar spine model. This was immersed in water. The model was scanned in a Siemens (Erlangen) 16-slice MDCT scanner. Twelve data sets were obtained using combinations of slice thickness (1.5, 0.75, 0.75 head protocol, and 0.6 mm) and reconstruction kernels (smooth, medium and sharp). Artefact in each data set was assessed at the CT workstation and personalised workstation, using identical window settings, CT numbers and a line profi le technique. Conclusion: A signifi cant difference was measured between steel and titanium pedicle screw artefact. The images presented have demonstrated that beam-hardening artefact can be reduced depending on the combination of slice collimation and kernel setting.",

Cornalba; Milan/IT Purpose: Skin-based measures obtained through optoelectronic system maybe a good technique to assess the functionality of the lumbar spine. However, soft tissue artifacts (STA) may be a signifi cant and relevant problem to accurately measure the mobility of the spine and so they had to be considered. Methods and Materials: 10 healthy people participated in the experimental setup. Twenty-four markers (pills of oil E vitamin) were attached onto the skin in correspondence to vertebral reference points. Six static fl exion/extension postures were acquired through a vertical MRI (vMRI). Then a fl exion/extension movement of the lumbar spine was acquired through an optoelectronic system. The estimation of the position of vertebral Center of Rotation (CoR) together with the knowledge of STA (obtained from previous studies) allowed the development of a new biomechanical model to assess the mobility of the lumbar spine. Finally these data were validated comparing the results of the biomechanical model with a gold standard (vertebral mobility through vMRI).",

Methods and Materials: All radiographs obtained in our emergency department from January through February 2006 were fi rst interpreted by ED physicians and compared with the formal radiology reports. Discrepant interpretations were marked for further study and classifi ed into one of four categories: false-negative interpretation by ED physicians, false-positive interpretation by ED physicians, false-negative interpretation by radiologists and false-positive interpretation by radiologists. Discrepancies that necessitated intervention and adverse outcomes were also recorded from the clinical summaries. Results: Of the 7309 radiographic examinations generated during the study period, there were 152 (2.1%) false-negative misreads by the ED physicians and 115 (1.6%) overreads. Only 22 examinations (0.3%) necessitated an alteration in clinical management as a result of the misreads. Three adverse events were recorded during the study period as a result of radiographic misinterpretation, all of which were cervical spine radiographs.

We show the topographic anatomy of each of these three regions, and the different puncture techniques recommended for each area. Conclusion: Brachial plexus punctures allow the locoregional blockade of several regions of the upper limb. US enables to guide the puncture with great safety, diminishing complication rates and undesired side effects, such as nerve lesion or the intravascular injection of local anesthetic drugs. Lesions were classifi ed as hypointense, isointense or hyperintense. Results were compared with fi nal diagnosis established by pathologic examination (n= 5). Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test. Results: Benign bone tumours and soft tissue lesions were iso-to hypointense to adjacent normal bone marrow. Malign bone and soft tissue tumours and benign bone lesions including infection and aseptic necrosis were hyperintense to normal bone marrow. Malign tumours and infectious processes had positive contrast ratios, whereas benign musculoskeletal tumours had negative values (p < 0.001). Conclusion: PSIF sequence may allow differentiation of malign and benign musculoskeletal lesions. Malign tumours show hyperintensity, probably owing to altered water proton mobility in neoplastic tissue. Benign lesions, except infection and aseptic necrosis of the bone, show hypointensity, refl ecting free water proton mobility. In infectious processes, hyperintensity may be attributed to infl ammatory cells, mucoid and proteineous matrix decreasing free water fraction in the interstitial space.",

Methods and Materials: Sixty patients (32 males, 28 females) (age range:1-83 years, mean age: 47\u00b118.3 years) with 61 lesions were involved in the study. 21/61 (34%) of the lesions were localized in the musculoskeletal system, 19/61 (31%) were in the neck area, 15/61 (26%) were in the anterior abdominal wall, 2/61 (3%) were in the peritoneal cavity, 1/61 (2%) was in the scrotum and 1/61 (2%) originated from the brachial artery. All lesions were examined with both the conventional B-mode and EFOV sonography. The fi ndings were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Sonographic images obtained with each technique were scored for lesion characterization, and for simultaneous demonstration of the lesions and their relationships with surrounding tissues. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Kappa scores were calculated to assess inter-observer agreement. Results: Wilcoxon test revealed that EFOV sonography was superior to B-mode imaging for both lesion characterization and for the determination of its relationships with neighboring structures (p=0.000). Kappa scores refl ected moderate to good inter-observer correlation (0.186-0.454). Conclusion: EFOV sonography is a practical and easily applied technique. This technique overcomes the problem of limited fi eld-of-view, which is one of the most important disadvantages of B-mode sonography. The simultaneous visualization of the lesions and surrounding structures in larger fi eld-of-views makes EFOV images more apprehensible compared with conventional B-mode images.",

In \"simple\" stimulus, most elements have preferred orientation. In case of \"complex\" stimulus, only a part of the elements have preferred horizontal or vertical orientation. The size, brightness and contrast of the stimuli were identical for chaotic and ordered patterns. Post-processing includes: (1) calculating statistical map with t-student criterion of more than 4, where hypothesis H 0 assumes that MR-signal intensity in rest is equal to activation intensity; (2) for the identifi cation of anatomical structures, the resulting maps were fused with the anatomical image and then both images were transformed to space of atlas Talairach.

When a patient must choose the preferred orientation of elements, click the left or right button of the mouse to discriminate between \"complex\" and \"simple\" stimuli; \"simple\" stimulus causes activation in the middle frontal gyros (Brodmann fi elds number 9/10).

Our purpose was to show its normal anatomy as well as the pathological changes in some diseases that involve it. Background: Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a useful technique to obtain brain maps from the white matter tracts. Our study is focused on the assessment of the VP after performing DWI maps to visualize the different parts of the VP. When compared to the results in normal subjects, the pathological features in patients can be classifi ed into 3 items: 1) Diseases that lead to atrophy of the VP (ocular globe enucleation, multiple sclerosis, hypovitaminosis); 2) Displacement of the fi bers caused by entities with associated mass effect (tumors); 3) Infi ltrating lesions of the VP (neoplasms, pseudodotumoral demyelinitation plaques). Procedure Details: All the studies were performed on a 1.5 T MR unit by using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence (fl ip angle: 90\u00ba, TR: 2020, TE:68, NSA:6) with b =800 mm 2 /sec. This protocol was modifi ed in 3 patients in order to obtain a better visualization of the pathology (TR: 8474, TE: 68, NSA: 6). We also acquired an anatomical imaging 3D/DTI. Post-processing was made in a workstation using the Philips PRIDE software. We get 2D and 3D color maps from the VP. Conclusion: DTI is a useful technique to study the normal and pathological visual pathway. Post-thalamic fi bers are easy to map, whereas the visualization of prethalamic fi bers is possible with a specifi c DTI acquisition protocol.",

To outline the pathological and imaging characteristics of these entities. Background: Intracranial dural-based lesions can be due to benign or malignant processes. Imaging characteristics cannot always discern between different pathologic conditions. A thorough clinical evaluation may reveal likely diagnostic possibilities. Procedure Details: An overview of the MRI characteristics of dural lesions is presented. There is also presentation of some pathologically proven lesions including solitary fi brous tumor, gliosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, melanocytoma, Hodgkin's disease, plasmacytoma, infl ammatory pseudotumor, plasma cell granuloma, Rosai-Dorfman disease as well as metastatic carcinoma. The role of the advanced magnetic resonance techniques such as spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion MR imaging is discussed. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of dural-based lesions in the brain varies from incidental and benign to symptomatic and malignant. Careful vigilance in patient's history is essential. Awareness that such lesions involve the dura may facilitate preoperative recognition and, in some cases, preclude unnecessary surgery. Learning Objectives: 1. To review pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria of mitochondrial disorder. 2. To investigate various neuroradiologic fi ndings in children with mitochondrial disorder and, particularly, unspecifi ed mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Background: Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes associated with abnormalities of mitochondrial energy metabolism. The impaired energy production results from the overall dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain, composed of 5 enzymatic complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We investigated the various neuroradiologic fi ndings in 40 children with mitochondrial disorder, and correlated them with the biochemical defect in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. Imaging Findings: Children with mitochondrial disorder showed different patterns of brain MR imaging abnormalities. Rapid progression of atrophy involving all structures of the brain with variable involvement of white matter were found in 29 patients, and the patients with complex I defi ciency showed more severe changes in serial scans; T2 prolongation of basal ganglia, thalami, brain stem and cerebellum in 18 patients with complex I or IV defi ciency; predominant cerebellar volume loss in 3 patients with complex I or IV defi ciency; and encephalomalacia of globi pallidi in 2 patients with complex I defi ciency. Conclusion: Children with mitochondrial disorder showed different features on brain MR imaging from a combination of various defects of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. Defects of different parts of the mitochondrial enzyme could result in the same abnormality on brain MR imaging, whereas identical biochemical defects could cause different imaging manifestations. Learning Objectives: 1. To illustrate the wide spectrum of intracranial lesions with ring enhancement on MRI. 2. To categorize these lesions according to imaging fi ndings on DWI and calculated ADC values. 3. To provide an easy-to-follow algorithm for the differential diagnosis of intracranial ring-enhancing lesions. Background: Ring enhancement is an unspecifi c MR fi nding occurring with a variety of aetiologies. It is most frequently encountered in neoplastic and infectious disorders, such as metastases, gliomas, and abscesses, but is also observed in vascular pathologies, such as resolving haematomas and infarcts. Because of the variable clinical course and prognosis of these diseases, an early and correct diagnosis is necessary for choosing the appropriate therapy. Procedure Details: We present the broad spectrum of intracranial lesions with ring enhancement on MRI with emphasis on the diagnostic impact of diffusion-weighted sequences and ADC values. Additionally, MR features that could be possibly helpful in distinguishing ring-enhancing brain lesions are discussed. Conclusion: DWI has recently shown promise in differentiating ring-enhancing lesions such as brain abscesses and malignant neoplasms. Combining the information of conventional MRI and DWI with ADC calculations, the correct diagnosis of ring-enhancing lesions can be achieved in a majority of cases.",

Purpose: Severe cerebral hypoglycemia with onset of neurological symptoms is frequently associated with reversible diffusion disturbances, which could be visualized as hyperintense lesions by diffusion weightened brain imaging particular in the splenium and the corona radiata region. This study is focused on the evaluation of hypoglycemic pathogenesis, especially with regard to the severity of insulin-induced reversible hypoglycemia. Methods and Materials: Seven volunteers received an i.v. bolus of 0.15 U per kg body weight short acting insulin inducing hypoglycemia, while the individuals were continuously evaluated by a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Sonata). Diffusion-weightened echo planar sequences (4500/107 TR/TE) were obtained without interruption. Additionally, serum blood glucose levels were also continuously monitored using Glucostix test strips; further more serum blood specimen were sampled for later laboratory measurements. Examination was stopped as soon as serum glucose level was diminished to < 2.0 mmol/l or the subject wished to abandon the trial due to vegetative symptoms. Images were independently analyzed by two radiologist. Results: All subjects revealed a hypocglycemia < 3.0 mmol/l for at least 10 min, mean serum glucose level decreased down to 1.94 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/l and one patient stopped examination at 2.6 mmol/l due to vegetative symtpoms. In the MRI diffusion images, no alterations pointing at an infl uence of cerebral diffusion could be observed in all individuals. Conclusion: Short-time severe hypoglycemia (< 10 min) does not induce visible changes in MRI diffusion imaging, suggesting long-time hypoglycemia maybe the relevant cause for observed reversible diffusion disturbance in MR imaging.",

To describe the advantages of proton MR spectroscopy evaluation. Background: Mitochondrial diseases constitute a complex and heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders caused by heritable abnormalities of the respiratory electron transport cascade. Although mitochondrial dysfunction manifests over a wide range of clinical expressions, it most often affects the muscle and brain, where dependence on oxidative energy metabolism is highest. The most common clinical features are muscle weakness, lactic acidosis and a broad range of neurologic defi cits. In this exhibit, we will analyse MR and proton spectroscopy fi ndings of primary lactic acidosis related to mitochondrial disease. Between January 1996 and January 2006, we analyzed MR and proton spectroscopy of 11 patients with lactic acidodsis and clinically suspected of mitochondrial disease. Procedure Details: Nine patients had lesions bilateral and simetrics, hyperintense on Flair and T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images in brain stem and basal ganglia. Three of them had thalamic involvement too. Proton spectroscopy revealed elevated lactate and a N-acetylaspartate reduction, both in areas that appeared damaged. In 2 of 11 patients, MR was normal but proton spectroscopy showed similar fi ndings. Conclusion: Proton spectroscopy is a useful investigational tool in the study of mitochondrial diseases as it supplies additional information to that of conventional imaging, because it documents metabolic anormalies even in areas of the brain that appeared to be normal.",

Several brain structural disorders have been implicated in epilepsy in pediatric patients. Imaging Findings: In this exhibit, we illustrate a spectrum of brain structural disorders encountered in MR imaging of pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy and their implications on treatment planning including cortical development abnormalities (focal cortical dysplasia, schizencephaly, heterotopia, polymicrogyria), hippocampal sclerosis, vascular malformations, post-traumatic lesions, infections, tumors, neurocutaneous disorders (neurofi bromatosis I, tuberous sclerosis), and mitochondrial disorders.

Shimada; Oita/JP (horiyuzo@med.oita-u.ac.jp) Purpose: In hyperacute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, viability of brain tissue depends on the residual blood fl ow which could affect the outcome after local recanalization treatment (LRT). The purpose of this study is to investigate whether superselective MCA angiography obtained prior to LRT could predict the recovery of ischemic brain tissue. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six patients having hyperacute MCA occlusion (32 patients of M1 occlusion, 4 patients of M2 occlusion) without signs of cerebral infarction on early CT underwent LRT. Pretreatment superselective MCA angiography via the microcatheter placed just distal to the occlusion site was executed to evaluate the fl ow-pattern in 60 (31 anterior trunks, 29 posterior trunks) of 68 trunks. The fl ow-patterns were classifi ed into three types: antegrade (n=28), retrograde (n=26), or stasis (n=6). The relationship between the degree of recanalization and follow-up CT fi ndings in each fl ow-pattern was investigated. Results: Cortical infarction occurred in 28 of 60 trunk territories. In antegrade type, 3 (21%), 8 (73%), and 3 (100%) territories had cortical infarctions in complete, partial, and failed recanalization, respectively. In retrograde type, 1 (14%), 2 (40%), and 5 (36%) territories had cortical infarctions in complete, partial, and failed, respectively. In stasis type, 6 (100%) territories had cortical infarctions regardless of degree of recanalization. The degree of recanalization is signifi cantly correlated with follow-up CT fi ndings in only antegrade type. Conclusion: Flow-pattern on superselective MCA angiography has signifi cant relationship with brain tissue recovery. Cases with antegrade fl ow-pattern would be a good indication for LRT. ",

Background: Intraventricular neoplasms are uncommon; they represent only the 10% of all intracranial tumours. Due to their deep location within the brain, they usually have diffi cult surgical access and consequently more potential risks of complications and consequently imaging assessment previous to surgery is essential to evaluate the extension and location of these tumours. Imaging Findings: Imaging features of 173 patients with intraventricular tumours were retrospectively reviewed. They showed a wide spectrum of radiological appearances that were non-specifi c, in many cases, making its differentiation diffi cult. The location of the mass within the ventricular system and the patient's age provided the most useful information, but other radiological features (calcifi cations, cysts, bleeding or enhancement) were helpful too. MR is the best technique to assess location and extent of the disease but in certain cases CT provides complementary evaluation of aspects such as calcifi cations or bleeding. Conclusion: Based on patient's age, location of the tumour within the ventricles and specifi c radiological features on MR, an accurate diagnosis can be made.",

A block design was employed and the baseline task was passively listening to a pure tone or viewing a cross. The fMRI data were analyzed using the SPM2. Results: Bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left inferior and middle frontal gyrus were activated during the auditory task. Bilateral occipital regions, left inferior and middle frontal gyrus, and left parietal regions were associated with the processing of all the visual stimuli.

To describe data-acquisition and post-processing of susceptibilityweighted (phase) images (SWI). To recognize artifacts. To demonstrate the technique in clinical cases and to compare it with standard MR imaging methods. Background: Magnetic susceptibility is a physical property of tissue that infl uences the MR-signal via the local precession frequency. Different blood-oxygenation levels, cerebral iron concentrations and many pathologies produce contrast in both magnitude and phase of gradient echo images. Procedure Details: High resolution 3D fl ow compensated gradient-echo data are acquired at long TE. Matrix=512x256x36, TE/TR/alpha=40/60/25 at 1.5 T, TE/TR/ alpha=30/40/20 at 3 T. Phase images are unwrapped with either a homodyne fi lter or a region-growing algorithm. The latter produces better results in magnetically inhomogeneous areas. The susceptibility-weighted MR phase images show a unique contrast independent of T1 and can be directly assessed and compared to the corresponding T1/T2*-weighted magnitude images from the same scan. Multiplying masks computed from the phase with the magnitude produces susceptibility-weighted images, which allow assessment of vascular architecture and function (if acquired during hypercapnia and normoxia). SWI of Sturge-Weber syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, tumors, arteriovenous malformations etc. provides additional information that is not accessible by conventional imaging. Conclusion: Susceptibility-weighted MR (phase) imaging of the brain provides valuable information at high spatial resolution. It facilitates detection of small lesions which may be missed by conventional methods. At 3 T acquisition time is reduced to 4-5 minutes due to shorter TE and the option to use parallel imaging because of increased SNR.",

Methods and Materials: Thirty-four clinical Gd-PSP underwent prospective brain MRI studies, from December 2004 to September 2005. MRI evaluation was performed with a 1.5 T MR imaging (Philips intera), in the University Hospital Radiology Department of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, Guadeloupe (France). The standard protocol included 6 sequences: sagittal T1-weighted Turbo Spin-Echo, axial T2w TSE (3 mm slices), Coronal T2w TSE (3 mm slices), Axial T2 * FFE, axial T2w FLAIR, axial protondensity. On each MRI, brain atrophy (cortical, subcortical, posterior fossa) and signals abnormalities (hypo or hyper signals on T2w images) of midbrain, pons and basal ganglia were respectively measured and evaluated. Each MRI was reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists. Results: Eight of 34 Gd-PSP MRI were not reviewable (motion artefacts). On the 26 exploitable cases, interobserver concordance of atrophy was good (p < 0.001). 80% had midbrain atrophy of which 32% presented a \"hummingbird sign\" on midsagittal T1w images. 75% had frontal atrophy. 19.2% presented an \"\u00e9tat cribl\u00e9\" in the basal ganglia, without \"hummingbird sign\".

Methods and Materials: Twenty-two healthy students (right-handed, age: 23.1 \u00b1 0.7 years) underwent an auditory simple reaction task based on the classic Poffenberger paradigm. 8 blocks of 36 trials were conducted, preceded by 2 blocks of 36 practice trials with an inter-block pause of 30-60 s.

Voxel-based regression analysis was conducted between fractional anisotropy and inter-individual aSRT results. Results: Signifi cant negative correlation [pFWE (family wise error probability) = 0.032] was found in the right-central cerebellum. Potent signifi cance was detected with right-sided stimulus presentation and response. No signifi cant correlation was observed, neither for left handed response nor left ear stimuli. Discussion: Our results imply an association between fractional anisotropy in the right-central cerebellum and aSRT measures. Presumably, the reason for this correlation is an infl uence of handedness on FA and aSRT.

NAA, Cr and Cho resonances ratios were calculated for the sum of the volume elements that represented the brainstem. Disability was rated with EDSS and MSFC.",

After follow-up, there was a decrease in NAA/Cho (-9%) and NAA/Cr (-15%) while T2LV increased (18%) in RRMS, without changes in controls. Patients with more than one relapse showed lower NAA/Cho at follow-up. NAA/Cho correlated with EDSS. At follow-up, an inverse correlation was found between NAA/Cho and T2LV (p=0.008). IFNB1a was effective in reducing disease activity (annual RR and T2LV) but ineffective in delaying axonal damage (all RRMS suffered metabolic decrements). Conclusion: Axonal damage begins and progresses from early stages of MS and has been related with clinical and radiological evidence of infl ammation. However, the stabilising effect of IFNB1a on infl ammatory activity appears not suffi cient in reducing neuroaxonal damage in a short-term study. Longer periods of observations are needed to confi rm these preliminary fi ndings. In the analysis of 1 H MRSI one voxel in each hemisphere including the inferior colliculus was selected for quantitative analysis. jMRUI program was used to analyze multivoxel. Relations among peak areas of NAA, Cr and Cho in the inferior colliculus were compared among groups in each region. SPSS 12.0 program was used for statistical analysis.",

After contrast injection, the tumour may enhance diffusely and densely or in its periphery (ring enhancement) if central necrosis is present. If perivascular spaces or meninges enhance as well, the diagnosis of PCNSL should be strongly considerated. Calcifi cations or bleeding are rarely seen. Surrounding edema and multifocal lesions are more frequently seen in immunocompromised patients. Conclusion: Due to new therapeutical strategies, the outcome for patients with PCNSL is rapidly improving in recent years; although the fi nal diagnosis relies on stereotactic biopsy demonstrating lymphomatous cells, the radiologist plays an important role in the noninvasive diagnosis of PCNSL thanks to the imaging fi ndings provided by CT and the combination of different MR sequences.",

After reading this exhibit, the reader will be able to understand the complex anatomy of the skull base, to accurately delineate phatologic processes, and to understand the spread pathways of different lesions involving this complex region. Background: The radiologist requires a thorough knowledge of the normal anatomy and the pathologic spectrum of the skull base. Imaging plays a central role in the management of skull-base disease, because this region is, in general, inaccessible to clinical evaluation. CT is ideal for outlining the bone architecture, whereas MR imaging provides soft tissue details. The pterygopalatine fossa represents a major pathway of spread of malignancy and infection from the head and neck into the skull base. Imaging Findings: A pictorial review of the skull base with foramina and their content (foramen ovale, rotundum, spinosum, lacerum, yugular foramen, and carotid canal), the pterygopalatine fossa and its boundaries, and the sutures of the skull base (occipitomastoid, sphenosquamous, petrosphenoid fi ssure, petrooccipital fi ssure, pterygomaxillary fi ssure) is provided. Conclusion: Familiarity with the complex anatomy of the skull base is a prerequisite for the correct diagnosis and accurate delineation of skull-base lesions.

Methods and Materials: Six patients (age 55-80) with internal carotid artery stenosis (> 60%) were investigated with motor task and co 2 stimulation. The data analysis was performed with FSL software. The mean percentage of signal intensity change during the motor task and co 2 challenge was calculated separately for both motor cortices.",

Conclusion: These results confi rm the effect of vasoreactivity on BOLD response in patients with carotid artery disease and show that neurovascular coupling is linearly and strongly correlated with CVR.

Studies were performed with a 1.5T Philips MR system. Region of Interest was measured in the 5-6 most vascularized areas of the tumor. The maximum Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) value was recorded for each area and divided by CBV of the contralateral periatrial white matter to obtain the relative CBV (CBVr Purpose: Endovascular stenting is evolving as the primary treatment option for cervical arterial dissections in symptomatic patients refractory to medical management. The tractability of balloon-or self-expandable stents into the tortuous intracranial vasculature is often diffi cult. Six patients at our institution have been treated using the fl exible intracranial Neuroform stent in tortuous dissected segments of the distal carotid and vertebrao-basilar arteries. We studied this population to evaluate this treatment approach. Methods and Materials: Six patients with distal internal carotid or vertebralbasilar dissections were treated using intracranial Neuroform stent. A total of 10 stents were utilized in 6 procedures. Dissecting aneurysms were treated via stent assisted coil embolization. Patients were followed with imaging and clinical assessment for a mean of 6.2 months. Long-term integrity, technical and clinical outcomes were assessed. Results: All patients were symptomatic from their dissections. Presenting symptoms included TIAs, persistent pain, hemispheric infarcts, and SAH. Spontaneous (3), traumatic (2), and iatrogenic (1) etiologies were responsible for dissections. Dissections were treated with single (n=5) or overlapping (n=1) Neuroform stents. One patient required 3 tandem stents to reconstruct a long segment dissection. Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%) with no residual fl ow limitation. Dissection related mean stenosis improved from 84% pre-procedure to 26% and 9% on post-procedure and follow-up imaging respectively. There were no recurrent TIAs, infarcts, or subarachnoid hemorrhages. There were no long term complications.",

We correlate imaging fi ndings and histological structure to explain the displayed atypical MR morphology and signal properties. We illustrate how to improve diagnosic accuracy with the help of advanced imaging techniques such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging and perfusion weighted imaging.

In vivo visualization of the hippocampus became possible with the advent of MR imaging, which has allowed the identifi cation of a variety of lesions that mainly affects this formation.

In 45 patients, more than two regions were involved. Contiguous involvement of adjacent regions was more common than skip lesions. There were three patterns of involvement: disk-vertebral lesion, those confi ned to the body and posterior arch lesion. Lesions sparing disks (40%) were nearly as common as those involving both body and disc (47%). Nearly 90% of disk-vertebral lesions were associated with paraspinal/epidural abscesses or cord compression, especially at the dorsolumbar junction. Body lesions were also associated a high incidence (70%) of abscesses and cord compression. One-third of these lesions were confi ned to the body (thus mimicking secondaries, lymphoma). Isolated posteriro arch involvement occurred in 13 patients. Conclusion: Spinal tuberculosis has a varied presentation and can mimic any disease of the vertebral column. Isolated pedicle involvement and multifocal body involvement can closely mimic malignancy. Purpose: MRI has become a critical diagnostic imaging modality for spinal disorders. Spine arthrodesis and arthroplasty devices are known to result in signifi cant artifacts on MRI. We assessed and compared the artifact resulting from four different biomaterials utilized in clinical arthroplasty devices when encountered in the same shape. Methods and Materials: Sheep lumbar spinal segments were harvested and the lower lumbar discs excised. Circular discs of the various materials were then used to fi ll the spaces. Polyethylene, Medical Ceramic, Titanium, and Chrome cobalt (CoCr) alloy discs were used. Images were obtained with a General Electric 1.5 T MRI unit in both sagital and axial sequences. The scans were reviewed by the authors (neuroradiologist and orthopedist) and the distortion graded between the various materials. The area of fi eld distortion and the device dimensions were also compared. Results: The distortion from polyethylene was the least severe and CoCr was the most severe on both sagital and axial MRI scans. Ceramic alone was mild with Titanium causing an intermediate fi eld artifact. The CoCr disc resulted in severe artifact on the MRI image, resulting in artifact which was twice the dimension of the disc.",

Potential pitfalls in their differential diagnosis will also be discussed. Conclusion: Lipomas, dermoids, and epidermoids of the CNS have distinguishing radiological appearance concerning especially their MRI imaging characteristics. By appreciating these, together with their site of predilection and affected age spectrum, any radiologist can reach the specifi c diagnosis in a majority of cases. Purpose: Central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement (neuroborreliosis) is frequent in Lyme disease and is often the fi rst presentation. Aspecifi c white matter lesions on T2-weighted images (WI) in neuroborreliosis have been published in the literature. Cranial nerve enhancement was frequently observed in our series. We present the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fi ndings in 9 patients with proven neuroborreliosis. Methods and Materials: Nine patients with positive serology for Lyme were included in this retrospective study. 8 MR studies of the brain, 1 of the lumbar spine and 1 of the cervical spine were performed. MR imaging of the brain consisted of T1-WI, T2-WI, fl uid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast enhanced T1-WI. Spinal studies included T2-WI, as well as T1-WI before and after gadolinium injection. Results: One brain study and the MR examination of the cervical spine showed no abnormalities. Five brain studies displayed aspecifi c white matter lesions. In four patients, cranial nerve enhancement (3 vestibulocochlear nerve, 2 oculomotor nerve, 2 trigeminal nerve, 1 facial nerve, and 1 glossopharyngeal nerve) was observed. In one patient, right hemispheric cerebellitis and leptomeningeal enhancement was described. MR of the lumbar spine showed polyradiculitis of the cauda equina. Conclusion: Aspecifi c white matter abnormalities are frequently observed in patients suspected for neuroborreliosis. Cranial nerve enhancement, cerebellitis, and polyradiculitis may narrow the differential diagnosis in these patients and neuroborreliosis must be considered when these fi ndings are encoutered, especially in endemic regions.",

            "text": "Background: Balloon dilatation of oesophageal strictures is well described in the adult literature. However, its role in the paediatric population after repair of oesophageal anomalies is less well established. Post operative stricture occurs in 30-50% of patients with oesophageal atresia. This carries a high risk of malnutrition and aspiration to the lungs. It is the most common post surgical complication and typically occurs at the primary site of anastomosis. At our institute, we have one of the largest case series of patients undergoing balloon dilatation of strictures after surgical repair of oesophageal atresia. Procedure Details: All procedures were carried out under general anaesthetic. The oesophageal lumen was opacifi ed with water soluble contrast to correctly identify the location of the stricture. A 4 F catheter and hydrophilic guidewire were passed through the mouth and manipulated under fl uoroscopic guidance across the stricture and into the stomach. A balloon catheter (15-20 mm in diameter) and 3-6 cm long was passed over the guidewire and positioned across the stricture. The balloon was slowly infl ated with diluted water soluble contrast under fl uoroscopy until the waist on the balloon was obliterated. A post procedure oesophagram was then performed to check for oesophageal rupture. Conclusion: Balloon dilatation of strictures following surgical repair of oesophageal atresia is clinically effective, safe, relatively atraumatic and is without high risk of complications.",

The examinations were carried out with and without PEEP, with a mean duration of 1 minute. Results: In all the patients examined, the thorax was kept immobile and continually extended, enabling the avoidance of interpretative errors, facilitating the differentiation of pulmonary pathology with extreme precision, distinguishing the types of bronchial obstruction associated with air trapping and facilitating the evaluation of the lower segments of the lung parenchyma, where collapse often occurs.

Imaging studies serve an important role in the diagnosis and management of many of these abnormalities. Systemic approach is required to understand the classifi cation and imaging features of orbital pathology. We have described them according to the three orbital compartments, namely, the globe/optic nerve sheath, intraconal and extraconal lesions. This extensive pictorial review outlines the various abnormalities of the paediatric eye and orbit for which imaging studies are often required, including infection, neoplasm, infl ammation and infi ltration, developmental anomalies, and trauma. Imaging included in this review includes the relevant plain radiography, CT, ultrasound and MRI features of various pathologies. Additionally, the pertinent fi ndings are correlated with pictorial description of the relevant histopathology, fundoscopy features and relevant clinical ocular photographs. Correlation of the results of imaging studies with pertinent clinical information allows the determination of specifi c diagnoses in most instances of paediatric orbital pathology. Control children were neurologically and developmentally normal and also showed normal MRI. MRI was performed from 0 to 5 years of corrected age in both groups. We measured the AP diameter of the pons, the tegmentum and basis pontis, and corpus callosum length using T1-weighted midsagittal image. Results: Pontine diameters in all regions were signifi cantly smaller in the PVL group than in the control group. Pontine diameters in the PVL group and control group were 1.66\u00b10.21 (SD) and 1.87\u00b10.23 mm (P < 0.001), respectively; tegmentum diameters were 1.23\u00b10.20 and 1.36\u00b10.19 (P < 0.001), respectively; basis diameters were 0.42\u00b10.10 and 0.51\u00b10.14 (P < 0.001), respectively; and the corpus callosum lengths were 5.02\u00b10.90 and 5.51\u00b10.76, (P < 0.001), respectively.

Purpose: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) often presents with nonspecifi c neurological symptoms that leads to different imaging work-ups. Better recognition of fi ndings of brain imaging (CT/MRI) helps physicians suspect to MMA diagnosis in earlier reversible stages of the disease. Methods and Materials: Fifty-two brain images of the patients with confi rmed diagnosis of MMA including 47 MR and 5 CT images were reviewed. The clinical data were also registered for each patient. The frequency of different radiological fi ndings were compared according to age,gender,clinical presenting symptom and duration of treatment. Results: Fourteen patients (26.9%) had normal brain images.The most common fi ndings of the images were (in order of frequency): ventricular dilation (32.7%), diffuse cortical atrophy (sulci dilation)(28.8%), periventricular white matter change (23.1%), corpus callosum thinning (15.4%), subcortical white matter lesions (11.5%), local cortical atrophy (7.7%) and cerebellar atrophy (7.7%). Basal ganglia calcifi cation was seen in 2 patients both of whom presented clinically in neonacy. Treatment duration seems to have an improving effect on the severity of ventricular dilation (less severity in those who have received the classic treatment for more than one year). Children who presented with psychomotor delay had usually multiple radiological fi ndings while few fi ndings were seen among those presented with loss of consciousness and those detected by neonatal screening. Conclusion: In addition to ventricular and sulci widening, myelination abnormality and basal ganglia changes, some other fi ndings are expected and rise the suspicion to MMA including corpus callosum thinning, brain stem thinning, signal change due to focal infarct, bright signal in centrum semioval and putamen calcification. Treatment with adequate duration may improve or prevent some structural changes in CNS. Learning Objectives: To describe the principal location of facial fractures in pediatric patients and their radiologic appearance. To discuss the optimal imaging work-up for detection of these fractures in children, with emphasis on the important role of CT. To describe our experience in this fi eld in the last 10 years: epidemiology and main mechanisms of trauma. Background: Trauma is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric age group, craniofacial fractures being accountable in a signifi cant part. There is great disparity in the available epidemiologic data and scant radiologic literature on this important subject. Interpretation of facial radiographs is specially challenging in children, and CT is required in many cases; therefore, we must be familiarized with the unique characteristics of these fractures. We retrospectively reviewed facial fractures attended in our institution in the last 10 years. The total amounted to 320 diagnosed fractures in 282 patients < 16 years. We analyzed the mechanism of trauma, patient age and sex, fracture location, and radiologic features. We fulfi lled a bibliographic revision and compared our results to those in the literature. Imaging Findings: The most common were nasal fractures, succeeded by mandibular and orbital fractures. Zygomatic, nasoetmoidal, frontal and panfacial fractures were found to be infrequent. The sex ratio was 1.7:1 (male/female). The main causes were accidental falls, followed by aggressions, motor-vehicle crashes, and sports accidents. Conclusion: Facial fractures in the pediatric age group have special characteristics, and therefore require subject-specifi c knowledge of the diagnosis, management, and follow-up. For the follow-up, 4 groups were defi ned: newborns with (1) lethal postnatal course (2) intensive respiratory care > 6 days and/or pulmonary hypertension (3) intensive respiratory care < 6 days, and (4) no need for additional respiratory support.",

Special consideration will be given to describe the lesions DDX according to their anatomic localization. Background: Masses of the head and neck area are a commonly encountered problem in daily practice. The aim of this exhibit is to review DDX of head and neck tumors in children with special regard to their anatomic localization. MRI and CT images will demonstrate the range of lesions from infl ammation to lymphoma, soft tissue tumors, and vascular abnormalities. Imaging Findings: The exhibit will review the different anatomic spaces to enable the reader to properly allocate a mass to its compartment. DDX will be explained with regards to their typical localization, imaging fi ndings and their clinical appearance. MRI and when it is useful for DDX CT images will be demonstrated in case presentations. A special emphasis will be laid on pitfalls such as vessel abnormalities or pseudotumors. Finally, readers will have the opportunity to test their knowledge in some quiz cases. Conclusion: DDX of masses in the head and neck region of children goes far beyond simple lymph node enlargement versus lymphoma. Depending on its localization, cervical cysts or tumors of neural origin may come into focus. Soft tissue or bone tumors, pseudotumors, and abscess formations or vessel abnormalities all may present as circumscribed lesions.

Methods and Materials: Thirty fetuses with anomalies of the neural tube and spine were studied. All patients underwent obstetric US examination. Intrauterine MRI was performed in 22 cases; in the remaining 8, MRI was not performed because indications went unobserved at US or further examination was considered unnecessary. MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla unit using ultrafast half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequences. Images were analyzed by a pediatric radiologist and the fi ndings were compared to those of US. All anomalies were confi rmed after birth or at autopsy. Results: The anomalies observed were acrania (n=3), encephalocele (n=3), iniencephaly (n=1), spina bifi da (n=8), diastomatomyelia (n=1), hemivertebra (n=3), kyphoscoliosis (n=2), amniotic band syndrome (n=1), osseous dysplasia with spinal involvement (n=3), caudal regression syndrome (n=1), sacrococcygeal teratoma (n=3), and conjoined twins (n=1). Neural tube and spinal column anomalies were associated to anomalies in other organs in 17 cases. Fetal MR provided additional information in 10 (45%) cases, and changed the therapeutic approach in 6 (27%). Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of neural tube and spinal column anomalies can predict fetal viability, orient the prognosis and management of the newborn, and has implications for genetic counseling. MR is a noninvasive method of fetal examination that provides additional information to US. in a factor of 5-10 if appropriate procedure protocol is used, with optimised setting for the X-ray system.

These conditions represent a heterogeneous group of disorders and include the normal transient neonatal renal medullary hyperechogenicity, the severe obstructive urinary stasis and intratubular refl ux, polycystic kidney diseases (mainly autosomal recessive polycystic disease), renal candidiasis, sickle cell anemia, the various common and rare causes and types of nephrocalcinosis, etc. Conclusion: Renal sonography with state-of-the-art US equipment is very sensitive in the imaging study of renal medullary pyramids in childhood. Knowledge of the specifi c sonographic features of the different pathologies affecting the renal pyramids supplemented by the necessary clinical information allows the narrowing of the differential diagnosis directing further diagnostic investigation, when necessary.",

Dromain; Villejuif/FR Purpose: Two per cent of the children referred to our cancer center have pseudomalignancy. The aim of this study was to analyze and correlate their clinical and radiological fi ndings. Methods and Materials: From 1990 to 2006, 98 patients with \"pseudo\" cancers, referred by well-trained clinicians, were seen. Twenty-nine had complete imaging and clinical history records and the fi nal diagnosis of proven non-malignant disease. There were 19 males and 10 females, between 1 and 17 years of age. The fi nal diagnoses were made through pathology (17), follow-up (12), and serologic analysis (1). Results: Frequent symptoms, variously combined and most frequently associated at the beginning, were: pain (17), fever (5), a mass (5), adenopathies (5), and walking diffi culties (3). One patient had two pseudo-malignancies. Thus, 30 lesions were studied with the following diagnoses: malignant bone tumor (9), lymphoma (5), nephroblastoma (3), neuroblastoma (3), soft tissue tumor (4), nervous tissue tumor (4), small bowell neuroendocrine (1), and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (1). 138 various radiological examinations were performed. There were in fact 15 infections, 7 traumatic lesions, 3 chronic diseases, 3 congenital lesions, and in 2 cases no disease corresponding to the clinically suspicious symptoms was found. Conclusion: Pseudo-malignancies are rare and diffi cult to diagnose, even by welltrained teams. The aim of the poster is to propose a review of images of pediatric pseudo-malignancies referred to an oncologic hospital, to make the reader more familiar with those possible problems, allow an easier and faster diagnosis, and avoid unnecessary and sometimes dangerous treatments. Learning Objectives: To provide a free program for handheld devices as a reference database in Pediatric Plain Film Radiography which serves the well and less experienced pediatric radiologist to differentiate between physiological age-specifi c and pathological fi ndings. Background: It is especially diffi cult for the inexperienced radiologist or the resident on-call to differentiate between physiological age-specifi c and pathological fi ndings due to developmental variations in the growing child. The suitable book is often unavailable. To solve this problem, an easy accessible format like handhelds would help in this situation. Procedure Details: Over 450 images in pediatric skeletal radiography can be displayed in radiographic standard settings on a handheld device. All images are categorized by body regions, age and gender. The database can be queried through selection of all three criteria or by choosing each criterion separately. The latter offers itself mostly for determination of bone age using the left hand. Each mode provides the user with at least one reference image according to each body region, age and gender. Conclusion: This program is a free reference database for almost all standard images in plain fi lm radiography, from infancy to adulthood. The database serves the radiologist on-call and the less experienced pediatric radiologist to differentiate between physiological age-specifi c and pathological fi ndings. Learning Objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of ultrasound image fi ndings after wrist and distal forearm trauma in children with no fractures detected on plain fi lms. Background: Wrist and forearm injuries are common in adolescent and become more and more common in younger group of children, mostly due to decreasing age of starting the recreational or professional sport activity. The interpretation of clinical examination in a child is often more challenging than in adults; thus, in the presence of different clinical symptoms (wrist pain, oedema, limited movement) together with normal radiographic examination, the question arises about the nature of the wrist/distal forearm tissue injury. Procedure Details: In 64 children who attended our paediatric admission unit because of wrist/distal forearm trauma and in whom the standard plain fi lms did not reveal any fracture, a wrist ultrasound examination, according to actual ESSR guidelines, was performed. We focused on tendons evaluation (continuity, tears), joint effusion or occult fractures depiction and precise assessment of the extent of soft tissue oedema. We tried to discuss the correlation between the most common ultrasound fi ndings and the patient age, as well as the injury mechanism and clinical symptoms. Conclusion: Wrist ultrasound is a valuable imaging method in children after wrist/distal forearm trauma. It is particularly helpful in cases of an equivocal clinical examination and in the presence of normal radiographic results helps to assess the character of the tissue injury. Learning Objectives: The purpose of this educational exhibit is to emphasise the role of diagnostic and/or therapeutic ultrasonography (US) in diverse congenital and acquired musculoskeletal diseases in children and adolescents. Background: US is a powerful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders owing to low cost, availability, non-invasiveness, multiplanar capability and real-time studies, which allow dynamic imaging. The absence of ionizing radiation is particularly valuable in children, but experience and proper training is required in the pediatric musculoskeletal pathologies. Procedure Details: A total of 120 patients who underwent sonographic evaluation in our tertiary center during the last 5 years were retrospectively evaluated. US examination was carried out with a Sequoia 512 or an Aspen (Siemens-Acuson), using high resolution technique, dynamic manouvres, contralateral comparison, Color and power Doppler, extended FOV function and interventional procedures.",

Data acquisition times were 5 sec (133 projections), 10 sec (248 projections), and 20 sec (495 projections). Results: The image quality degraded as the object was away from the center or when the data acquisition time was short, probably due to the nature of cone-beam 3D reconstruction and the reduced number of views.

Methods and Materials: Using a vertical linear array detector, one tomogram image can be acquired when the object is translating and rotating simultaneously. This method is completely different from that of a normal X-ray CT. We used a fan-beam X-ray. The direction axis for the detector and rotating axis are parallel. Because a hundred or thousand tomograms with Z-axis are from just one scanning, this system has excellent Z-axis resolution and has the advantage that this technique can improve the resolution in the X-Y plane with changing translating speed and frequency of data acquisition.

Methods and Materials: Examination parameters for renal and aortoiliac procedures were derived using data from 80 consecutive procedures performed in our institute. Organ and effective doses were estimated for endovascular procedures using the Monte Carlo (MC) transport code and an adult mathematical phantom. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were used in an anthropomorphic phantom to verify the MC calculations. Radiation-induced cancer and genetic risks were estimated using appropriate coeffi cients. Results: Results are presented as doses normalized to dose area product, so that the patient dose from any technique and X-ray unit can be easily calculated for iliac and renal PTA/stenting sessions. The average effective dose varied from 15 to 24.5 mSv depending on procedure scheme and the sex of the patient. Differences of up to 17% were observed between MC-calculated data and data derived from thermoluminescent dosimetry. Conclusion: Male patients up to 59 years old are subjected to a signifi cantly fatal cancer risk.

Furthermore, in 30 clinical cases acquired by multislice 120 kV CT (Aquilion, Toshiba), calculated the absorbed dose using an arc beam calculation system. Results: In a homogeneous phantom, the difference between values measured by ionization chamber and those estimated by RTP were 0.13\u00b17.66% at Y axis, -1.09\u00b117.64% at Z axis, and 1.00\u00b13.76% in the total irradiation fi eld. In a heterogeneous phantom, the difference between PLD and RTP values was 4.97\u00b120.48% for the body and -7.05\u00b117.92% for the lung. Conclusion: The RTP system may be a simple and useful tool for estimation of absorbed radiation doses inside the human body even during whole-body CT acquisition. (13) and vascular surgery (4) centres participated in this multi-centre study. Individual extremity doses were monitored per procedure with highly sensitive detectors at fi ve positions: the forehead, both hands and both legs. Doses to up to three staff members (physician, assistant, nurse) were simultaneously measured during a procedure and relevant exposure data (position, patient-DAP-dose, protection) were registered. Results: Data was collected from a total of 280 procedures. The median dose per procedure to the physician's eyes (62 \u00b5Sv) was signifi cantly lower than the doses to the legs (181 \u00b5Sv) and hands (193 \u00b5Sv) as most centres used an under table X-ray tube exposure geometry. A moderate to strong correlation between patient-DAP-dose and dose to the physician was observed. At vascular surgery centres, DAP-normalised staff doses were about three times higher than in angiography centres. In centres with a low workload, elevated normalised doses were observed. Extrapolated data showed that two physicians may likely exceed both annual dose limits of the eyes (150 mSv) and the skin of the legs (500 mSv). About one third of the physicians removed themselves consistently from the patient during image acquisition. This proved to be a very dose effi cient working procedure. Procedure Details: First, CT numbers from CT images were converted into mass density and elemental weights of tissues required as input for dose calculations with GEANT4, which is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. They were set by x-y coordinate, slice location, and slice thickness. They were exposed to X-ray from the X-ray tube simulator developed by us in GEANT4. The simulator exposes X-ray of any energy spectrum (tube volt: 60 kV-150 kV), any expose fi eld, etc. The absorbed doses at skin and at other organs were calculated. The fusion images of CT dose can be displayed by the viewer developed by us.",

The aim of our study was to quantify the occupational radiation exposure for a technologist working in a mobile PET unit, evaluating both internal contamination and external irradiation. Methods and Materials: Internal exposure: each technologist was issued with a Personal Air Sampler that collects the air that the worker is really breathing. External exposure: personal dose equivalent Hp (10) has been quantifi ed using electronic dosimeters. Occupational radiation exposures have been evaluated twice a week for six months based upon an operating PET effi ciency of 9 procedures/day. Learning Objectives: To describe the acceptance of radiation proctection courses for health care professionals in Germany by an anonymous survey. Background: Maintaining safe utilization of ionizing radiation and radiation protection of staff, public and environment requires high levels of competencies. In 2002, the German Radiation Protection and X-ray Ordinance put health care professionals employing ionizing radiation under an obligation to recertify theoretical and practical knowledge. Personnel, i.e. physicians, physicists, radiographers, nurse-practioners and specialist staff, have to enrol for an offi cially approved radiation protection course every 5 years. 8 or 12 hour classes with a multiple choice tests are held by lecturers, radiation protection offi cers and experts in the fi eld. However, a preconceived opinion across all levels of professionalism declares radiation protection education and training redundant and costly. Procedure Details: Course participants were asked to fi ll in an anonymous questionnaire [n=599, radiographers (45%), physicians 44%, including 25% consultants and 10% medical directors]. The survey itemized age, vocational training, professional group, fi eld of practice, course content, stimulus, practicality and course costs. 80% estimated the theory-practice-performance ratio as balanced. Stimulus (great many 20%, many 57%, some 20%). The courses came to participants' expectations (fully 62%, for the most part 33%, partly 4%. Full coverage of the expenses (120-150 Euros) by the employer was reported by 65% of the participants. Conclusion: Although radiation protection is widely considered as a stepchild in health care delivery, professionals are aware of adequate education needs and training.",

Background: An increased risk for MRI-associated skin burns has been described for pictorial tattoos using iron coloured pigments. Not until recently, permanent Make-up, a new and rapidly spreading cosmetic technique, has been recognized for putting the patients at risk of burns by MR imaging. Procedure Details: Neither iron pigments nor larger tattoo areas are required to induce burns in these patients. To gain a special colour effect cosmetic tattoos contain metals such as iron, copper and zinc. Locally, electric current can be induced by any of these metals in a high-frequency magnetic fi eld, even if only subtle eye lining has been performed. This mechanism of locally induced electric current is responsible for possible dysesthesia and burns in patient's skin containing a cosmetic tattoo, e.g. permanent make-up during MRI examination. A clinical example, review of the literature and recommendations for addressing this problem in the daily MR practice will be given. Conclusion: Permanent Make-up, for medical purposes better adressed as cosmetic tattoo, can cause severe local damage to the skin during MRI studies even if it is free of iron oxides. Every MR radiologist should be aware of these risks and direct patient's management and staff training accordingly. combining a body coil for radio frequency transmission and an endorectal coil to receive signal. Three-dimensional MRI and MRSI data were collected with magnetic fi eld homogeneity in the selected volume obtained by shimming water with lipid suppression accomplished with selective inversion of lipid resonances. Peripheral voxels were saturated to suppress periprostatic fat and air. We will review how data is then processed and how to interpret a prostate spectrum. Conclusion: In summary, this poster serves to demonstrate the technical aspects of 3D MRSI including practical aspects of implementation and technical considerations. Hopefully, radiologists will understand the basic principles of prostate MRS imaging, and by realising the feasibility and clinical possibility of providing MRSI will be encouraged to initiate prostate spectroscopy. Conclusion: Understanding the magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility effects and their infl uence on imaging appearance allows the clinical radiologist to make a wise selection among the broad range of imaging sequences available to minimize artefacts, enhance pathology detection as well as limit the differential diagnosis.",

Van Purpose: To evaluate breath-hold diffusion-weighted black-blood echo-planarimaging (BBEPI) as potential alternative for SAR-intensive spin-echo sequences for liver imaging at 3.0 T. Methods and Materials: After institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained, 14 healthy volunteers were scanned at 3.0 T, using an ASSET compatible 8-channel cardiac coil. Parameters were set to cover the entire liver (25 cm z-axis) in one 25-sec breath-hold, and were varied interactively with regard to TE, TR, diffusion b-value, slice thickness and voxel size. Images were evaluated and compared to fat-suppressed T2w fast-spin-echo (FS-T2w-FSE) for image quality, liver delineation, blurring, geometric distortions, fat-suppression, suppression of the blood signal, CNR and SNR. Results: The optimized short-(25 ms) and long-echo (80 ms) BBEPI provided 2 mm and 4 mm slice thickness with full anatomic, single breath-hold liver coverage (100 and 50 slices, respectively), resulting in voxel size 3.1x2.6x2.0 mm 3 and 3.1x2.6x4.0 mm 3 .

For three volunteers measurements were performed twice with identical sequence parameters except for the water suppression pulse which was switched on only during the fi rst measurement. Spectra were evaluated by the LCmodel. Results: Comparison of absolute concentrations of the metabolites NAA, Cho and Cr obtained with both methods showed stronger differences for voxels located in border areas of the selected volume. The differences between concentrations estimated by using NAA and water as a reference were clearly more pronounced in the parietal region (NAA: 5.4 vs. 7.0 mmol/L; Cr: 3.2 vs. 5.4 mmol/L; Cho1: 0.7 vs. 1.4 mmol/L) compared to the frontal region (NAA: 6.4 vs. 7.2 mmol/L; Cr: 3.9 vs. 4.6 mmol/L; Cho: 1.1 vs. 1.2 mmol/L). This refl ects the spatial variations of the coil sensitivity. Conclusion: As technical parameters like coil-sensitivity and load-factor affect measurements with and without water suppression in the same way, corresponding errors in the estimated absolute intensities can be avoided. Therefore, if time allows an internal reference should be preferred compared to estimation by a reference solution without correction of the sensitivity profi le of the coil. ",

Results: The TSE sequence was found to provide dosimetric results of comparable accuracy with those obtained from CPMG multi-echo acquisitions (within one pixel in the MRI gel readout session, i.e. < 1 mm), and to accurately predict treatments planning calculations and conventional dosimeter measurements in a range of radiotherapy applications that involve very steep dose gradients and stringent dose delivery requirements and which require high spatial resolution in all three dimensions.

Background: As digital mammography has been getting more popular, monochrome LCD monitors have also been spreading among radiologists. However, higher resolution and contrast performances are required in order to achieve the accurate diagnosis of mammograms, for example detecting microcalcifi cations. We have developed new 5M-pixel monochrome LCD monitor with \"Glare\" panel which improves resolution performance. Imaging Findings: Established \"Anti-Glare\" panel has waffl ed surface to diffuse the refl ection of ambient light. But it also diffuses the light from the monitor's backlight. As a result, the displayed image is blurred especially on outlines compared to the original image. On the other hand, \"Glare\" panel has fl at surface so that there is no blur with the displayed image. It means that there is no degradation of resolution performance with surface coating. Conclusion: Resolution performances of both panels were compared by measuring MTF (Modulation Transfer Function). \"Glare\" panel showed higher MTF than \"Anti-Glare\" panel, which proves the higher resolution performance of \"Glare\" panel.",

            "text": "Results: A linear relationship was found between the number of detected holes and the logarithm of exposure. On average, the structured phosphor system required 55% less phantom entrance air kerma than the conventional phosphor plate. Differences in exposure requirements were smaller with decreasing thicknesses of simulated tissue thickness and lower tube voltages (74% at 20 cm and 102 kVp, and 36% at 10 cm and 60 kVp). All differences were statistically signifi cant. Conclusion: Structured CR provides improved low contrast detectability and a potential for dose reduction compared with conventional CR. The best performance was achieved with conditions comparable to those for adult radiography (102 kVp and 20 cm of PMMA). Learning Objectives: To provide insight into current practices of clinical applications of Multi-slice Computed Tomography (MSCT) using the new generation of CT systems able to acquire simultaneously at least 16 sections, and to identify specifi c applications that justify the radiation exposure. Background: Rapid technical developments in CT have had a substantial impact on the applications of this technology. Since CT is already associated with a relatively high (collective) patient dose, a review of current practices was performed. Procedure Details: Administrative patient data on diagnostic applications corresponding to one contiguous year, and CT reports corresponding to 10% of the annual data have been retrieved from the information systems and referral forms of six radiology departments in different European countries. Data pre-processing included coding the medical specialties, the age groups, anatomic regions, and most important coding of the diagnoses from medical details mentioned in the reports. The resulting database includes 70041 CT examinations, of which 54127 were referred by medical specialties concerning 33149 patients. To learn from these data, descriptive analyses have been performed. Conclusion: CT examinations are predominantly performed on patients in the mid-and higher age categories. The highest referrals are by oncology; followed by surgery, internal medicine, neurology and neurosurgery. A substantial number of patients received more than 6 CT examinations in 1-year, mostly for oncology. Most frequent diagnostic categories are neoplasms; followed by diseases of the musculoskeletal system, vascular system, respiratory system, digestive system, urinary tract, and nervous system.",

Results: X-ray scatter causes a falloff of MTF [6% at very low spatial frequency (0.1 mm-1) and 9.5% for the rest of the spectra] and adds a constant amount of noise (3% from 0.5 to 2 pl/mm, 6% from 2.5 to 4 pl/mm and 8% from 4.5 pl/mm to the Nyquist frequency).

Background: Discoveries of Nikola Tesla represent basics of traditional, but also modern imaging techniques. Tesla's work is present in every radiological department, including fl uorescent lights in viewboxes, alternating current (AC) supplying the equipment, Tesla-Knott generator used for X-ray equipment, etc. One of Tesla's never completed work was experiments with what would later be called X-rays. Procedure Details: Tesla's articles published on the topic of X-rays and their biological hazards in The New York Electrical Review in the years 1896 and 1897, Tesla's biography, as well as medical papers mentioning Nikola Tesla were analyzed. Conclusion: Since April 1887, Tesla began investigations using Crookes tubes, and his own vacuum tube which was a special single-electrode X-ray tube without target electrode. It seems that by 1892, he became aware of what Roentgen identifi ed as X-rays effects three years later. He didn't publicly declare his fi ndings nor make them widely known, and much of his research was lost in a fi re in his laboratory in New York in 1895. He was also among the fi rst to comment on the biological hazards of working with X-rays with the conclusion that distance was a useful safety factor.",

Optimisation can be done by maximizing the NECR that in turn depends on the coincidences rate. Methods and Materials: For each bed, the scanner (Biograph Duo, Siemens) records the coincidences and the singles rates in a log-fi le. For each patient, we fi gure out the functions Trues=T (s), Randoms=R (s), Scatters=S (s) (where s = single count rates) by fi tting the NEMA 70 cm phantom count rate curves on the measured clinical points, in order to analytically calculate the personalized PseudoNECR (s) curve linked to the NECR curve. Results: For central beds, we estimate a missing activity of ~70% to get the PNECR_max, but the improvement in terms of SNR that we could get is around 15%. We also estimated the correlation between the patient weight and the PNECR_max, in order to fi gure out which should be the scan duration of a single bed in function of the patient weight to acquire the same PNEC. If we normalize the counts at the PNECR_max for the 70 Kg patient, the bed duration for a 90 kg patient should be 230s, which is ~30 % longer. Conclusion: Although the analysis indicates that the fast electronics implemented in the scanner allows the use of higher administered activities, we found that this would involve a poor improvement in terms of NECR. The attention can be instead addressed on the usefulness of higher bed duration for heavier patients.",

In the color Doppler mode with low PRF values, this displacement was registered as coloration corresponding to movement from the probe. Increase in intensity of the displacement was marked under the following conditions: Focus shift to distant zones; implementation of Doppler modes, especially power mode; increase of Doppler frequencies. Reduction of movement intensity was registered in the following cases: Reduction of acoustic power level (at 40% quite stopped), increase of liquid viscosity (the suspension of talc in glycerin practically did not move). Conclusion: Visualization of streams in liquid accumulations is a refl ection of real liquid untwist, which can be explained by the well-known physical phenomenon -acoustic current.

Methods and Materials: Data collected from 21 Danish X-ray departments show a wide variation in parameter settings prior to a cervical examination. To assess the absorbed dose in the thyroid gland, TLD (tablet lithium fl uoride) are used. The tablets are placed in the area of the phantom, which corresponds to the thyroid gland\u00b4s anatomical position. Image quality is assessed using images of a specially designed plexiglass phantom, which is equivalent to a human phantom in density and overall composition. The plexiglass phantom has a built-in linear phantom and density holes that enable one to measure and assess the contrast in the images. Results: Signifi cant dose reduction was achieved by using PA instead of AP exposure, resulting in minimal image quality deterioration. By using AEC in AP, PA exposure with 66 kV, one can reduce the dose signifi cantly. The best image quality is achieved under AP/PA exposure using grid ratio 12:1. However, with the ratio 8:1, we were able to observe a signifi cant dose reduction of up to 74%, but at the same time there was a slight deterioration of image quality. Conclusion: This experiment shows that with a certain predetermined parameter regulation, a signifi cant dose reduction of 60-74 % is achieved in the thyroid gland. At the same time, a slight image resolution reduction is observed that does not affect the diagnostic quality of the image.",

This phantom based study examined the effects of increasing aluminium fi ltration up to 7.0 mm on radiation dose and image quality. Dose optimization is of added importance when lumbar spine radiography is performed on females of childbearing age, due to increased risk of cancer induction in young patients and the risk of irradiating an undiagnosed foetus. Methods and Materials: Serial AP and lateral lumbar spine radiographs were taken of a tissue equivalent phantom, beginning at a total fi ltration level of 2.5 mm, and increasing in increments of 0.5 mm, up to 7.0 mm. Three exposures were taken for each projection at each fi ltration level. TLDs were used to measure entrance surface dose, reproductive organ dose and fetal dose. Image quality assessment was performed using anatomical criteria based analysis. Results: For the AP lumbar spine exposures, the optimal level of total aluminium fi ltration was 6.5 mm.

Method I: To achieve isolated distension of the colon, 5-10 ml of air was infl ated 30-60 times, then about 20 ml of air was pumped 10-15 times. If tension around the coecum was felt, scout view was done. Method II: To achieve distension of the colon and small bowel simultaneously, infl ation was started by pumping 20 ml of air 25-40 times, then about 15-20 ml of air was pumped 10-15 times. With this method, air can pass easily through the Bauchim valve. Results: Distension of the colon was appropriate with both methods. In 140 cases, we wanted to produce isolated colon distension. It was succesful in 127 cases. In 50 cases, we wanted to examine small bowel too. It was successful in 47 cases. Conclusion: With these two methods, a higher percentage of cases could be successfully examined.

To provide a pictorial assay of different diseases as they appear on CT-E. Background: Computed Tomography Enteroclysis (CT-E) is a technique for the assessment of the small bowel. It is performed after small bowel distension by administration of a high volume of contrast medium via a nasojejunal catheter followed by CT acquisition. CT-E combines the inherent advantages of conventional barium enteroclysis (i.e. homogeneous luminal distension resulting from volume challenge) with those of cross-sectional imaging (i.e. simultaneous detection of intraluminal, mural and extraintestinal abnormalities). However, it is a challenging technique with several steps that have to be optimised. Imaging Findings: The main variability observed between different protocols regards the choice contrast medium. German investigators use positive contrast agent (i.e. diluted barium sulphate suspension or water iodinated contrast material), American and Italian investigators use neutral intraluminal contrast agents (i.e. water or 0.5% methylcellulose). Differences are also reported in the choice of nasojejunal catheter (i.e. Maglinte or Rollandi techniques), in the use of sedation and in the preparation of patients.

Asano; Toyoake-city Aichi/JP (tsujioka@fujita-hu.ac.jp) Learning Objectives: This report illustrates a scanning method used to achieve isotropic resolution and a display method that allows for the effi cient use of isotropic resolution in image diagnosis. Background: Traditionally, we understand that CT scan images come from tomography. However, due to recent developments in helical scanning and multi slice CT technologies, CT scanning equipment has advanced from two-dimensional to three-dimensional data collection, and, similarly, CT images have shifted largely to three-dimensional observation of a section from a two-dimensional one. Isotropic resolution is an essential factor in meeting current needs in CT technology. Isotropic resolution means that the elements composing CT images hold equal, three-dimensional resolutions. Imaging Findings: For evaluating spatial resolution, a micro globe 0.18 mm in diameter made of tungsten was used. For evaluating contrast resolution, we used a dual glove phantom having a small difference in CT value. We also evaluated artifact.",

The imageacquisition factors were the following: 4x5 mm collimation, 1.0sec/rotation, 120kv. Forty ml of intravenous contrast was injected at a rate of 5 ml/sec followed by 20 ml saline. The delay between the start of injection and scanning was 5 sec in 33 cases and 10 sec in 14 cases. The tube current was set 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mA in esophageal cancer patients. All the data were reconstructed with 2.5 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm. The shape of time density curve (TDC) was visually evaluated and the association of prognosis and blood fl ow was evaluated. Results: The prognosis and blood fl ow was best correlated when the slice thickness was 5 mm. The shape of TDC was bad scanned at 60 mAs in esophageal cancer patients.

There is not enough reference data about technical parameters of paleoradiological examinations. The aim of our study was to develop and describe the methods of paloradiological examinations and the radiological study of mummies and ancient human bones. Methods and Materials: Sixteen naturally mummifi ed human individuals and 30 bone remains were examined. The bones were at least thousand years old and originated from different places in Hungary. The mummies were discovered in the crypts of Dominican Church, V\u00e1c, Hungary, from burials between 1731 and 1841. Conventional radiographs on phosphor plates (at least two views), spiral CT and 1 mm HRCT examinations were performed. From spiral CT data, 3D reconstructions were also made. Results: In the cases of mummies, the conventional radiography parameters had to be reduced by about 75% because of the body's lost water content. Summation was often unavoidable. Obtaining and displaying CT scans also required special settings. The examinations of the bones most frequently revealed traumas and trepanation of the skull. Many degenerative changes of the spine and the joint surfaces were detected. Signs of rheumatoid arthritis, Paget disease, facies leprosa and vertebral tuberculosis could be discovered. In the mummies, vertebral changes, pulmonary tuberculosis, fractures and other traumatic lesions were diagnosed. Conclusion: Radiological examination of ancient bones and mummies can help to diagnose pathological changes in these human remains. New methods for X-ray and CT examinations are necessary due to the special features.",

Concepts of \"nursing\", \"environment\", \"health\" and \"human being\" were used as the starting point, because they are commonly applied but not clearly defi ned in radiography. Data were collected in forms of literature, expert interviews and written material, and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results: Concepts defi ning the research focus were found to be \"clinical radiography and radiotherapy\" (substitute for \"nursing\"), \"environment\", \"health and illness\" (substitute for \"health\"), and \"human being\". These concepts were also found to be connected to each other in several ways. Each concept was provided with a theoretical defi nition, and a model was formulated to describe the research focus of this new academic fi eld, which was named as \"the clinical science of radiography and radiotherapy\". Conclusion: Results suggest that this new academic fi eld may be profi led by a distinctive research focus, diverging from that of nursing science. Results also suggest that this new fi eld must be named as the clinical science of radiography and radiotherapy. Results may be exploited in further academic development, theory development and education within radiography and radiotherapy. B D E F A G",

Images were acquired with a rotating C-arm (Axiom Artis; Siemens), acquisition time was 20 seconds. During a rotation of 200 degree, 538 projections were acquired. Images were displayed in MIP and VRT mode. Eight patients got intraarterial contrast medium (CM). Imaging Findings: In all patients, the entire stentgraft was exactly shown and alignment of the prothesis along the landing zones was well displayed. The aneurismal sack was well shown in 11 patients (1 patient had traumatic rupture). 1 x an endoleak II was detected, 2 x an angiographically verifi ed endoleak I was not detected (1x suboptimal CM timing, 1x no CM administered). Aortic side branches were well shown in all contrast enhanced studies except 1 (suboptimal CM timing).

Detection of feeding artery during transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation for hepatocellular carcinomas using 3D-CT angiography generated from the data set of CT hepatic arteriography M. Hirata, T. Kajiwara, T. Tsuda, T. Mochizuki; Toon Ehime/JP (masaaki@m.ehime-u.ac.jp) Learning Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of 3D-CT angiography (3D-CTA) reconstructed from thin-slice data set of CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) obtained from 16-channel angio-CT system for detection of the feeding artery of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in comparison with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Background: Selective catheter placement into the feeding artery is important for effective treatment of HCCs and avoidance of hepatic damage after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, it is sometimes diffi cult to recognize three-dimensional vascular anatomies on two-dimensional DSA alone. 3D-CTA generated from CTHA enables us to identify the exact feeding artery, which is sometimes diffi cult to depict by intravenous CTA, because direct opacifi cation of hepatic artery allows us to produce very precise 3D-CTA. Information of the detailed vascular anatomy and bifurcation point of feeding artery is simultaneously available when we perform TACE. Procedure Details: Patients were injected with 15 mL of nonionic iodinated contrast material at 1.5 mL/sec via a 2.3 or 4 F catheter placed in the common hepatic artery. CTHA was performed at 10 seconds after the start of injection. 3D-CTA was rapidly generated on the imaging workstation equipped for angio-CT system. The vascular anatomies and the target artery for chemoembolization could be recognized easily, especially on the movie display of the 3D-CTA, which gave hints of suitable selection of devices and helped us to make the effi cient strategy for selective TACE. Conclusion: 3D-CTA generated from CTHA is useful for the detection of feeding artery of HCCs during TACE.",

In all cases, we performed a retrospective ECG-gated technique, followed by conventional MSCT study of the thoracic aorta. All cases were reconstructed in multiplanar, MIP and VR reformations. Dynamic cine-mode imaging of the aortic valves and thoracic aorta was also done in all cases. Imaging Findings: Images of ascending aorta diseases and postoperative changes are depicted without cardiac motion artifacts; the coronary arteries and their relationship with aortic disease and surgery are assessed. Dynamic studies of the aortic valves and thoracic aorta are presented. Artifacts due to a loss of cardiac synchronization, breath motion and insuffi cient aortic coverage are shown.

Methods and Materials: CTA was performed using 32-MDCT from the aortic arch (AA) to the parietal region. Seventy patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of CM (300 mg/ml) administration protocol: Group1 (n=35) received 40 ml of CM with 25 ml of saline fl ushing at 4 ml/sec; group 2 (n=35) received 60 ml of CM in the same fashion. First, time to peak enhancement (Ti) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at circle of Willis (cW) was calculated by test bolus method. Next, scan duration (sd) between AA and cW was calculated (collimation 1.25 mm; pitch 0.969; rotation time 0.4 sec). Scan was started at [(Ti+4)-sd] (sec) in group1, and [(Ti+9)-sd] (sec) in group 2. Thirteen ROIs were placed from AA to above the cW. Mean attenuation of carotid arteries (CaAs) and cerebral arteries (CeAs) were quantitatively analyzed. Venous contamination (VC), and VR and MIP images were also visually analyzed. Results: Although there was a statistically signifi cant difference (p < 0.05) in mean attenuation of each artery between both groups, the attenuation of all arteries in group 1 was over 200 HU, and analysis of VC in group 1 was better than that in group 2. Visual analysis of CaAs showed no difference, and that of CeAs in group 2 was better than group 1. Conclusion: A 40 ml CM CTA of the brain and neck may provide suffi cient attenuation and diagnostic performance.",

Takano; Chiba/JP Learning Objectives: In this exhibit, we illustrate the normal branching pattern of visceral arteries and their variants in the abdomen with use of volume rendering technique. Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has come to be recognized as a useful diagnostic tool for preoperative evaluation. For example, angiographic images can be easily acquired after administration of IV contrast media. There is a certain kind of vascular variant that can be a potential source of complication during laparoscopic-assisted surgery for its inherent property (e.g. limited view of the fi eld, loss of three-dimensional depth perception, limited surgical manipulation). Therefore, preoperative vascular mapping in each anatomic site would help your colleague. Imaging Findings: Replaced left hepatic artery arising from left gastric artery, common trunk of left gastric artery and common hepatic artery, tortuous course of splenic artery were all depicted and relevant to procedures of or complications after laparoscopic partial gastrectomy. Resection of left gastric artery from which left hepatic artery branches can lead to liver dysfunction. Whether ileocecal artery runs anterior to vein or not determines an approaching method for exposure of superior mesenteric vein during right hemicolectomy. Delineating root of left colic artery would facilitate left colic artery preserving lymph node dissection during laparoscopic low anterior resection. Conclusion: With recent widespread use of laparoscopic procedures, more detailed information about relevant anatomy is required. MDCT providing 3D images could be an imaging method of choice for the purpose.",

Purpose: To prospectively determine the feasibility of two different protocols in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) using the current generation of 64-detector row CT scanners. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients with known PAOD underwent 64-CTA (Sensation Cardiac, Siemens). Patients were randomly divided into two different groups (A, B) regardless of age or severity symptoms. Group A was studied using a regular CT scan following the base rule of scan time=contrast material (cm) administration duration; thus, 10 patients received 80 mL of highly iodinated cm (400 mgI/mL) at 4 mL/s; scan time was 20 s and a bolus trigger technique was employed at the level of the proximal abdominal aorta and the acquisition started soon after the attenuation reached 150 HU. Group B received 110 mL of the same cm (independently of scan duration or patient characteristics) with bolus tracking positioned at the level of the infrarenal abdominal aorta; scanning started 13 s after attenuation reached 150 HU.

To demonstrate the causes of pulmonary embolism (PE) misdiagnosis with the use of CT angiography. 2. To become familiar with a range of pitfalls. 3. To highlight the radiologist's need to determine the quality of a CT pulmonary angiographic study. Background: Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTA) is the modality of choice at our institution for the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism because of its high sensitivity. Despite the high accuracy of this method, there are several pitfalls that cause indeterminate CT pulmonary angiography. These pitfalls may be a consequence of patient-related factors such as respiratory motion artifact, image noise and presence of pulmonary artery catheter. Technical factors include mostly inappropriate window settings, partial volume artifact and stair-step artifact. Furthermore, various anatomic and pathologic factors are responsible for the poor quality of the examination. The anatomic factors include partial volume averaging effect in lymph nodes and vascular bifurcation. Finally, coexisting pathology can decrease the value of diagnosis such as mucus plug and tumor emboli. Procedure Details: The patients were examined using 8-detector row CT (GE). The examinations were performed with 4 ml/sec injection rate of 150 ml contrast agent and collimation 16x 0.75 mm with a pitch of 1.2 mm. Conclusion: Although CTA is the standard at many institutions for pulmonary embolism diagnosis, there are several factors that reduce this ability. The radiologist is requested to evaluate the quality of the study and, if it is poor, he should identify which pulmonary vessels are rendered indeterminate and whether additional imaging is necessary.",

Methods and Materials: 242 patients underwent CTA using bolus-tracking technique, of which 189 patients underwent subsequent CTV. We administered two different amounts of nonionic iodine contrast medium depending on the body weight of the patient: patients with body weight > 50 kg undergoing both CTA and CTV received 450 mg I (group B), while other patients received 300 mg I (group A). The enhancement of vessels was subjectively estimated by the four-point scale and densities were measured at the predetermined levels. Multiple regression analyses were performed with density as the dependent variable, and age, sex, weight, contrast medium, scan delay and presence of embolism as independent variables. Results: The mean scan delay of CTA was 19 seconds (SD: 3.3; range: 10-31). Subjective estimate of enhancement quality in CTA did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.778), while it was signifi cantly better in group B than in group A (p < 0.001) in CTV. Multiple regression analyses revealed that body weight and age were the only signifi cant and consistent independent variables associated with enhancement of the pulmonary arteries. On the other hand, contrast medium, body weight and scan delay were the independent variables consistently associated with the enhancement of deep veins. Conclusion: Bolus-tracking technique showed relatively small variation in the scan delay time. Age, body weight and contrast medium were the important factors associated with vessel enhancement in combined CTA and CTV. Purpose: To evaluate whether low-volume contrast material (CM) MDCT angiography (CTA) utilizing aortofemoral bolus transit time (Taf) can provide suffi cient contrast enhancement. Methods and Materials: CTA was performed using 32-MDCT with 1.25 mm collimation. After surgical bypass graft of abdominal aortic aneurysms, 40 patients were divided into two groups. In group 1 (n=20), Taf was acquired from time to peak aortic enhancement (Ta) at L1 vertebra and time to arterial enhancement at femoral heads by twice-test bolus method. Scan duration was arranged according to individual Taf, and scan delay was 4 sec after Ta. A 40 ml CM (300 mgI/ml) with 25 ml saline fl ush at 4.0 ml/sec was used for CTA. In group 2 (n=20), Ta was calculated only at L1 vertebra. Scan delay was 9 sec after Ta, and table speed was 38 mm/sec. An 80 ml CM was used for CTA in the same fashion. Mean aortofemoral attenuation and mean differentiation between maximum and minimum attenuation were quantitatively analyzed, and also cross-sectional, MIP, and VR images were visually analyzed. Results: Although there was statistically signifi cant difference in mean aortofemoral attenuations (309.4 \u00b1 41.8 HU in group 1 vs. 331.8 \u00b1 64.1 HU in group 2), visual analysis showed no difference between both groups. It is interesting to note that mean differentiation between maximum and minimum attenuation was signifi cantly smaller in group 1 than that in group 2 (26.2 \u00b1 14.1 HU vs. 61.8 \u00b1 45.1 HU, p < 0.01).

Background: Although the assessment of source images provides precise local information concerning vessel diameter, source and area, it is often diffi cult to appreciate their spatial relationships and mentally reconstruct their global morphology. MIPs and VRIs are based on post-processing algorithms developed in order to improve the rendering of the overall morphology and/or spatial relationships of anatomic structures, but in addition to their strengths, they have weaknesses that can lead to artefacts and misinterpretations. Procedure Details: MIPs and VRIs are the most widely used means of showing MR angiography data; 3D image displays of vascular anatomy frequently provide excellent information. But both types of reconstruction are associated with disadvantages, such as the misrepresentation of spatial relationships and failure to detect eccentrically located stenoses. A case series is shown to illustrate these aspects. Conclusion: Vessels with low-signal intensities that may be partially or completely imperceptible on post-processing images can be seen on individual source images. In order to improve detection, it is essential to integrate the information coming from SIs, VRIs and MIPs.",

Methods and Materials: Seven patients with carotid atherosclerosis underwent contrast-enhanced MR angiography of carotid bifurcation by SIEMENS 3.0 T MR scanner. Hemodynamic variables and fl ow patterns of the stenotic carotid bifurcation were calculated and visualized by combining vascular imaging postprocessing and CFD. Results: As the extent of stenosis were commencing and aggravating, the stronger jets formed at the portion of narrowing and more prominent fl ow separation in the ICA with regions of slow retrograde fl uid eddies in the lee of the stenosis. Regions of elevated wall shear stress (WSS) were predicted at the portion of stenosis and at the path of the downstream jet. Areas of low WSS were predicted on the leeward side of the stenosis, corresponding with the location of slowly recirculation turbulent fl ow. Conclusion: CFD combined with MRI can be used to simulate fl ow patterns and calculate hemodynamic variables in the stenotic carotid bifurcation as well as normal carotid bifurcation. The abnormal high WSS may be relative to the rupture of vulnerable plaque. The secondary turbulent, recirculation fl ow associated with low WSS regions on the downward of stenosis are likely to favor plaque development and thrombogenesis.",

There being no consensus on indications for MRRA, this study was performed to identify which patients would best benefi t from the procedure. Methods and Materials: Provisional guidelines for requesting MRRA were formulated, including: diastolic BP > 105 at any age; peripheral vascular disease; abdominal bruit; sudden increase in BP; high serum urea and creatinine and/or low serum potassium; BP not adequately controlled despite 3 medications. 100 consecutive patients referred for MRRA were reviewed retrospectively, and the results correlated with the indications and patient management. Renin and aldosterone measurements and renal ultrasound scans were also considered, where available. Results: There was 92% compliance with the provisional guidelines. 92% of studies were diagnostic, 44% being abnormal, with a change in management in 88%. The results correlated well with clinical suspicion and ultrasound fi ndings, but not with serum urea, creatinine or renin measurements. Conclusion: A written referral protocol for MRRA can achieve good compliance and best use of a limited resource, reducing unnecessary requests and aiding non-specialists in selecting appropriate patients. These indications are proposed: i. high BP and age < 40 and ii. high BP and/or chronic renal failure (CRF) with any of the following: audible vascular bruit; > 1.5 cm difference in bipolar renal length on ultrasound; unexplained pulmonary oedema; unexplained CRF with other vascular disease; worsening of renal failure with ACE inhibitor.",

Background: Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography represents a good alternative to catheter digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to assess peripheral artery graft patency. MR angiography is safer, faster, and less costly than DSA. Postoperative graft surveillance is of particular importance, because fl ow impairment is the major cause of graft failure. It is important to detect early graft stenosis to improve the bypass patency rate. Venous and expanded polytetrafl uoroethylene grafts are used to treat peripheral artery occlusion. Autologous venous grafts have a primary and secondary graft patency superior to that of expanded polytetrafl uoroethylene grafts. Imaging Findings: MR angiography can identify accurately graft stenosis involving the proximal and distal anastomosis as well as the midportion of the graft course. Aneurismal ectatic changes can also be assessed on MR angiography. Metallic clip presence can represent a limitation on MR angiography; the susceptibility artifact produced by the clips can produce a misinterpretation of the images. Source images should be evaluated to avoid misinterpretation of clip-induced susceptibility artifacts as stenosis.",

The diagnosis was confi rmed by pathohistology after the surgical treatment in all patients. The tumors were 12-49 mm in diameter and well vascularized. Results: DSA detected insulinoma in 21/28 patients (sensitivity 75%). Computed tomography detected insulinoma in 11/28 patients (sensitivity 39.28%, p < 0.05 vs. DSA), whereas magnetic resonance detected tumors in 15/28 patients (53.57%, p < 0.05 vs. DSA). In 7 patients in whom DSA failed to detect insulinoma, the diagnosis was achieved by computed tomography or magnetic resonance. The potential causes for DSA's failure to detect insulinoma are poor vascularization of the tumor and presence of extra gasses in the bowel. Conclusion: Digital subtraction angiography has better sensitivity than computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. So, it has a major role in the detection of insulinoma.",

Adam; London/UK Learning Objectives: Over the last ten years, dulpex ultrasound has become the primary modality used to assess lower limb venous disease. As a result, the use of contrast venography has declined and in some institutions is rarely performed. This pictorial review is based on the authors' experience and aims to review the indications, techniques, venous anatomy and pathology as demonstrated by lower limb contrast venography. Background: Contrast venography has long been considered the 'gold standard' in the assessment of lower limb veno-occlusive disease and can effectively demonstrate thrombus within the below knee veins. Since duplex ultrasound has the advantages of being non-invasive and does not use ionising radiation, it is favoured by both clinicians and patients as the initial diagnostic test for deep vein thrombosis. Radiologists in training no longer have the exposure previously available and may not be familiar with the techniques or the appearances of common pathology. Procedure Details: The indications, technique and radiological appearances of lower limb venography are illustrated. Emphasis is placed on common anatomical variants that are often poorly recognised by routine duplex ultrasound. The use of venography in the assessment of venous malformations, venous tumour encasement and in the post-phlebitic limb are also discussed. Conclusion: Venography remains the 'gold standard' in the assessment of lower limb venous disease. However, since this method is no longer in frequent use, it is imperative that radiologists remain familiar with the current indications, technique and interpretation of the test.",

Atherosclerosis is the main cause of CMI (95% cases), usually involving the ostium of celiac artery (CA), superior or inferior mesenteric artery (SMA or IMA). Other rarer causes are nonatheromatous lesions (dysplastic lesions, thromboangitis obliterans, radiation-induced lesions, Takayasu arteritis\u2026). Imaging Findings: Evidence of visceral artery occlusion with noninvasive imaging such as DUS, CTA or MRA could suggest CMI, if other causes of abdominal pain have been confi dently ruled out. In DUS a peak systolic velocity greater than 275 cm/sec or end-diastolic velocity greater than 45 cm/sec seems highly specifi c for signifi cant SMA stenosis. Vascular obstructions, stenosis, collateral pathways and changes in the bowel wall can be depicted on both CTA and MRA. If endovascular treatment is proposed, angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard. Conclusion: DUS, as the preferred noninvasive screening test for SMA and CA stenosis, followed by CTA, MRA or angiography allow us to make the diagnosis of CMI, as well as a valuation of extension, severity and number of affected arteries.",

Prabhudesai; Hamilton, ON/CA (pjbanerjee@hotmail.com) Learning Objectives: To better appreciate the imaging characteristics of Takayasu's Arteritis based on various modalities and thereby improve detection and surveillance of disease activity. Background: Imaging characteristics play a critical role in the diagnosis of Takayasu's Arteritis given that both clinical presentation and serological markers are non specifi c. Traditionally, angiographic studies have primarily been used to demonstrate the vascular effects of this disease. However, employing additional and/or alternative modalities provide a more complete understanding of Takayasu's Arteritis. Our institution serves as a local referral base for rheumatologic conditions and the Department of Medical Imaging is routinely consulted in cases of suspected vascultitis. We have selected a group of patients whose imaging best illustrates the salient features of this clinical entity. The benefi ts and shortfalls of angiography, ultrasonography, contrast enhanced CT and MRI are reviewed and a pictorial essay is offered to illustrate various fi ndings using these modalities. Imaging Findings: While angiography is the traditional gold standard for investigation of vasculitides, ultrasonography provides a non invasive alternative with fewer side effects, albeit at the expense of lower predictive value and operator dependance. Cross sectional imaging by means of CT and MRI also offer non invasive visualization of luminal pathology with the additional benefi t of demonstrating changes within the wall. Conclusion: Although knowledge of angiographic fi ndings of Takayasu's Arteritis aid in the evaluation of this disease, familiarity with imaging characteristics of other modalities allow the radiologist to better assess patients and offer additional and less invasive imaging options.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives: To evaluate the combined use of Doppler US, MRI, MR Angiography and DSA for the diagnosis and follow-up of Takayasu arteritis. Background: Takayasu arteritis is characterized by granulomatous infl ammation of the arterial wall which eventually leads to stenosis, occlusion and sometimes aneurysm formation. Classical diagnosis has been based on characteristic fi ndings of the aorta and its major branches at conventional angiography or DSA. However, current developments in the fi eld of cross-sectional imaging have increased the diagnostic capacity of radiological methods even in the early systemic phase without any luminal abnormality. We present the combined radiological approach for the patients with Takayasu arteritis. Procedure Details: Cervical, renal, abdominal and extremity arterial Doppler US examinations were performed for obtaining direct and indirect information about arterial fl ow and vessel wall. Thoracoabdominal MRI and MR Angiography studies were performed on a 1.5 T scanner with body coil. Multiplanar T2-weighted fat-suppressed, T1-weighted black blood inversion recovery before and after administration of Gd-DTPA and contrast enhanced 3D MR angiography sequences were obtained. Image interpretations were performed after post-processing studies. All luminal fi ndings were compared with DSA results. During the follow-up, US and MRI fi ndings about vessel wall thickening and contrast enhancement of arterial wall were also evaluated. If necessary, endovascular treatments were performed according to the activity of the disease. Background: DVT is a common vascular disease requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment but clinical assessment is often unreliable. D-dimer testing and pre-test probability scoring are used as guides for selection of the most appropriate investigation. Vascular imaging remains essential for diagnosis and B-mode and Doppler US, MDCT and MRI play an important role in the work-up of the disease. Procedure Details: The authors discuss advantages and limitations of each method in the evaluation of DVT, illustrating thoroughly the spectrum of fi ndings at US, MDCT and MRI. Technical principles are outlined as fundamental tools to optimise disease detection and avoid potential pitfalls. Conclusion: B-mode and Doppler US is a cost-effi cient and widely available technique for initial evaluation of suspected extremity DVT. MDCT and MRI allow visualisation of affected areas non-accessible to US imaging. MDCT with shorter acquisition times, greater coverage and reduced scan width provides excellent resolution in depiction of the disease, and detection of eventual complications as pulmonary thromboembolism.",

Background: Double-J catheters have been in use since 1967 in the treatment of ureteral obstruction and fi stula. They are also used to help decrease the likelihood of sepsis or obstruction after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Double-J catheterization constitutes a simple and effective method of upper urinary tract drainage used in the most variable clinical situations. Procedure Details: In our presentation, we divide the complications associated with Double-J placement in 5 groups: a) infections; b) defi cient positioning or migration of the stent; c) traumatic lesions; d) loss of anti-obstructive functionality; and e) structural alterations of the stent. We provide several examples of these lesions, in a multimodality approach.",

Andreu, T. Presa, G. Fernandez, L. Fresno, L. Del campo; Madrid/ES Learning Objectives: To review concepts about neuroendocrine tumors including their location, histopathology and diagnosis approach. To show clinical and radiological features of neuroendocrine tumors and correlate them with histology.Background: An extended distribution of neuroendocrine cells explains an extremely diverse tumoral location of this tumoral lineage. There are neuroendocrine cells in adrenal medulla, anterior pituitary, gastroenteric tube, pancreas, aortic and carotid bodies, parathyroid and neural tissue, thyroid, torax and some tumors with variable differentiation like prostate and breast. Some of these tumors are associated with syndromes such as von-Hippel-Lindau, Neurofi bromatosis or MEN syndromes. Some of them are hormonally active, classifi ed as either syndromic (functioning) or nonsyndromic (nonfunctioning), on the basis of clinical and laboratory fi ndings. Procedure Details: We reviewed retrospectively the radiological fi ndings in CT and MRI of neuroendocrine tumors of our data base. The fi ndings were correlated with pathology results in each of the cases. We specially go in depth with the ones localized in pancreas, digestive tube and adrenal medulla, since they are the most frequently founded in our centre, but we also go through the radiological fi ndings of the ones in unusual locations.

Drossos; Athens/GR (christinaiosif@yahoo.gr)Purpose: This is a two-year study of management of complex facial trauma with use of multislice CT and various reconstructions.Methods and Materials:We have selected 208 patients mostly presented as traffi c or work accidents in a period of 2 years using a 16-row multislice CT. The data were analyzed by multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), surface shaded display (SSD) and volume rendering (VR) occasionally and were read by 2 radiologists. Results: The 208 patients scanned had complex fractures, 113 of which could be classifi ed as Le Fort type, and 95 complex bone fractures of other types, with or without soft-tissue fi ndings or indirect signs. As far as orbital fractures were concerned, identifi cation of bone dislocation and fragments were of importance as well as identifi cation of soft-tissue entrapment and occular muscle trauma, air and foreign bodies in the orbit etc. In maxillofacial trauma dislocation of bony structures, minor fractures and condylar injuries were the target. The Le Fort type fractures were additionally classifi ed as combined or not combined with other fi ndings. The reconstruction of these provided valuable information of space relationships, particularly useful for the design of operation. The evaluation of facial nerve was attempted in 34 cases (with partial/complete palsy) where coronal oblique MPR reformations were valuable. Conclusion: The use of MPR, SSD and especially VR protocols allows extended evaluation of minor and complex fractures as well as soft-tissue impairment in relatively small structures such as the occular muscles and the facial nerve.",

Methods and Materials: From January 1991 to August 2006, 1542 liver transplantations had been carried out in S. Giovanni Battista Hospital of Turin. Eighteen angiographic examinations were performed in 13 patients with 15 liver grafts (2 re-OLT): 10 PTA of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, 6 PTA + stenting of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, 1 TIPS, 1 PTA + stenting of the portal vein. The indications for radiological procedures were clinical (refractory ascites) in 5/18 (28%) cases and based on US, phlebographic and manometric fi ndings in 13/18 (72%). Results: Interventional procedures obtained technical success in all the cases.Clinical resolution was achieved in 10/15 (67%) OLT. In 1 patient, a surgical repair was performed following an accidental stent migration in the right atrium. Conclusion: Hepatic venous (very uncommon complications in recipients of piggyback technique) and portal anastomotic stenoses can be successfully treated with interventional procedures, with a low incidence of major complications. In case of inferior vena cava involvement, stent placement (necessary after several unsuc-cessful PTA) can exclude the patient from a new transplantation.

Gao; Shanghai/CN (liminhua@online.sh.cn)Purpose: To investigate the fl exibility of the covered stent specially designed for cranial internal carotid artery (CICA), the occluding capacity of the covered stent for the vascular lesion of CICA. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients with CICA lesion (3 giant pseudoaneurysms, 4 giant aneurysm, 3 small aneurysms with wide necks, 1 giant pseudoaneurysm with CCF, and 1 CCF) were treated by using the intracranial covered stent. Angiographic follow-up was performed 3-24 months after the procedure. Results: BOT was negative in all 12 cases. The covered stents all reached their destinations through CICA without diffi culty. The lesion locations where the covered stents were released were C3-C4 in 3 cases, C4-C5 in 4, C6-C7 in 5. The immediate cerebral angiography ofter procedure showed that aneurysm disappeared in 8 cases, slight endoleak in 2, and greatly-reduced fi stula in 1 case with CCF. The remaining 1 case of pseudoaneurysm with concurrent CCF had only slight low-fl ow fi stula after isolation of the pseudoaneurysm from parent artery by the intracranial covered stent. Follow-up DSA demonstrated patency of the parent artery in all 12 cases. All 12 cases had no complications related to the occlusion of the branching arteries at the parent artery at follow-up. Conclusion: The intracranial covered stents are fl exible enough to pass the tortuous CICA and reach the area of intracranial vascular lesion and are very effi cient in managing the CICA aneurysms. The evaluation of long-term patency of the CICA with covered stnets needs long-term follow-up.C-543Percutaneous repair of mitral valve insuffi ciency(sinoplasty): The role of 64-slice CT in the design and treatment planning E.

Methods and Materials: Adult MSC were isolated from the bone marrow of rats. Adult MSC were labeled with 200 \u00b5g/ml (U)SPIO or with 60 \u00b5g/ml (U)SPIO in combination with the transfection agents (TAs) Dosper\u00ae or jetPEI\u2122. MSC were characterised by in vitro differentiation; surface receptor expression was analysed by FACS. Spectrophotometrical quantifi cation of the cellular iron content and determination of cellular viability were performed additionally. Results: Labeling of aMSC with (U)SPIO was feasible without affecting cell viability or their adipogenic, osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation potential. (U)SPIO labeled aMSC without TA showed an enhanced expression of CD71 (the transferrin receptor) in contrary to (U)SPIO labeled aMSC with TA and control cells. TAs augmented the iron content of the cells, especially jetPEI was very effective. Conclusion: (U)SPIO labeling without TA does have a biological impact on aMSC by up-regulating TfR.

Methods and Materials: Gray-scale and Color Doppler Sonography (CDUS) were perspectively performed in 38 patients with a clinical suspicion of reactivated bone infection after orthopedic surgery and induction of metallic implants. Affected areas included tibia (9 patients), femur (10 patients), knee (6 patients), and hip (13 patients). Parameters evaluated included soft tissue abscess and sinus tract; intaarticular, juxtacortical and extraarticular fl uid; distension of pseudocapsule cortical/periostealand peri-implant vascularity. The fi nal diagnosis was established on aspiration and cytologic examination. Results: Based on the fi nal diagnosis, 20 patients had bone/implant infection whereas in 18 patients bone/implant involvement was not confi rmed. Patients with active bone infection exhibited more frequently the following fi ndings compared to patients without confi rmed infection: juxtacortical fl uid (17/20 vs 4/18, p < 0.05), increased intaarticular fl uid with extraarticular extension (11/20 vs 3/18, p < 0.05), pseudocapsule distension (16/20 vs 5/18, p < 0.05) and soft tissue abscess (13/20 vs 9/18). Sinus tracts extending to bone cortex were seen in all patients with bone implant infection (20/20), but in none of the patients without infection. CDUS revealed low resistance arterial fl ow within periosteum/ bone cortex in 19/20 patients and around the metallic implant in 4/20 patients with bone infection respectively, whereas no Doppler signal was detected in any patient without infection. Conclusion: Ultrasonography can be of help in detecting reactivation of bone infection in patients with posttraumatic osteomyelitis and metallic implants.",

Horger, H. Brodoefel, M. Vogel, J. Fritz, B. Denecke, C.D. Claussen;Tuebingen/DE (mshorger@med.uni-tuebingen.de)    Purpose: The goal of this study was to establish the role of direct assessment of medullary involvement by myeloma using whole-body low-dose multidetector computer tomography (WBLD-MDCT) compared with the sole interpretation of the course of lytic bone lesions or even together with established hematological parameters in patients receiving long-term bisposphonates. Methods and Materials: Between June 2002 and December 2005, WBLD-MD CT scans using a standardized protocol were obtained in 131 consecutive patients with MM, resulting in a total of 439 investigations. Osteolysis, as well focal, or diffuse medullary lesions were registered. The results were then and at follow-up related to current laboratory tests. Validation was achieved by combined reading of both hematologic and radiologic parameters at follow-up in analogy to standard therapy response criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Results: The course of osteolysis showed little agreement with that of medullary lesions when PD, R-PR or R-CR were present. Thus, a progress of osteolysis was observed by WBLD-MDCT in only 21/101 (21%) of examinations with validated PD, although in 91/101 WBLD-MDCT was capable to visualize disease progression by progress of medullary involvement. In 1/2 patients presenting with R-CR, osteolysis showed no changes at the given time point, while of 39 patients with R-PR, progress of osteolysis was noted in 4 (10.3 %).",

Carriero; Novara/IT (dvolpe@sirm.org) Learning Objectives: Shoulder magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography depends on an effi cacious intra-articular injection. The aim of this exhibit is to compare all of the available techniques by examining each step. Background: Although the role of glenohumeral MR arthrography is a matter of debate, it is becoming increasingly apparent that it is the examination of choice for evaluating the capsulolabral complex, the undersurface of the rotator cuffs, the glenohumeral ligaments, the rotator cuff interval, and postoperative shoulders. Capsular distension makes it possible to distinguish individual structures by improving soft tissue contrast and physically separating the intra-articular contrast material, thus allowing an analysis of the distribution of contrast material in and around the joint. Shoulder MR athrography depends on the effi cacy of the intra-articular injection, which may be guided by palpation or imaging, and performed anteriorly or posteriorly depending on the clinical indications. Procedure Details: a) Anatomy of the shoulder joint; b) Radiological and MR anatomy of the shoulder joint. c) Techniques of intra-articular access: C1: palpation; C2: imaging (C2a: ultrasound; C2b: fl uoroscopy; C3c: computed tomography); d) Limitations and tips; E) Case gallery.Conclusion:The techniques for multi-modality gadolinium solution injection in the shoulder joint are reviewed in a practical teaching fi le, together with a literature review.

Fortuna; Murcia/ES (silviatdr@yahoo.es) Purpose: To evaluate 1 H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with low MMSE score identifi ed during a community-based study of dementia. Methods and Materials: A sample of 1493 individuals (> 64 y-o), stratifi ed by age, gender and residence, was randomly selected. 215 (MMSE\u226424) were sent to a dementia unit and sorted in clinical groups (Dementia-D, Alzheimer's Disease-AD, mild cognitive impairment-MCI, and normal-N) according to DMS IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Only 56 could be fully analyzed with both MRI and MRS. Two single voxel PRESS sequences (TR 1500 ms, TE 35/144 ms) were carried out in the posterior cingulate gyrus. Mean ratios NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, NAA/mI, and NAA/Cho were compared (ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test). The ability of MRS to distinguish clinical groups was assessed by ROC analysis. Results: Regardless of the TE, NAA/Cr, and NAA/Cho were signifi cantly lower in D or AD compared with MCI and N (p < 0.01). In D vs non-D analysis, NAA/Cr-TE35 ms and NAA/Cho-TE35-144 ms showed an area under the curve-AUC 83.1%, 82.5%, 84.8%. NAA/Cr-TE35 ms and NAA/Cho-TE35 AUC were 83.7% and 80.1%, respectively, when confronting AD and N. For MCI and N, AUC was NAA/Cr-TE35 ms 86.1% and NAA/Cho-TE35-144 ms 80%, 83.9%. MRS ratios were not helpful in MCI and N comparison. To differentiate AD and N, NAA/Cr 35 ms showed sensitivity 77.8%, specifi city 91.2%, positive predictive value 70.1% and negative predictive value 94.0% at a cut-off point of 1.40. Conclusion: NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho were the most useful ratios for clinical groups grading, especially for distinguish D and AD from MCI and N, but not for MCI vs N comparison.C-653Neuroradiologic fi ndings in children with mitochondrial disorder: Correlation with mitochondrial respiratory chain defects M.

Background: Advances in MRI technology have improved signal to noise with increasing main magnetic fi eld strength, and spatial resolution with high fi eld imaging and allow superior visualization of smaller structures of the craniovertebral articulations. The recent studies have offered the identifi cation of traumatic lesions on MR images of craniovertebral junction. Familiarity with normal anatomic structures is necessary for the detection of traumatic lesions and to prevent misinterpretation of variations of the ligaments. The normal ligamentous anatomy and some variations of craniocervical junction were described and illustrated in detail using 3-Tesla MR images. Procedure Details: Magnetic resonance images were obtained using 3-T unit with an intermediate echo T2 fast spin echo (FSE) sequence. Imaging protocol as follows: 2200/15 msec (TR/TE), 512x224 matrix for axial and coronal, 512x320 matrix for sagittal, fi eld of view (FOV) 18 cm, echo train length of eight, bandwidth 32 kHz, slice thickness 2 mm interleaved (0 mm skip), four excitations (NEX). Scan time was 6:36 min for axial, 3:18 min for coronal and 5:57 min for the sagittal plane. Conclusion: This method allows excellent visualization of the normal ligamentous anatomy and variation of the cranio-vertebral junction in detail and provides a background for evaluating injuries that can give rise to instability.C-712MRI fi ndings in \"SCIWORA\" in children and adults O. Ghekiere, D. Hernalsteen, T. Duprez, G. Cosnard, F.

To describe the spectrum of MRI fi ndings in SCIWORA in children and adults. Background: The use of MRI in patients with post-traumatic symptoms of spinal cord damage but no radiographic or CT abnormality has lead to the recognition of isolated lesions of the spinal cord. This entity has been described in early childhood and in elderly patients with severe degenerative disc disease (DDD) in the lower cervical segment. This exhibit shows MRI fi ndings in these situations and highlights the possible observation of SCIWORA in young adult patients with constitutional narrowing of the spinal canal. Imaging Findings: SCIWORA is illustrated in three different situations: young child, elderly people with severe narrowing of the spinal canal in relation to DDD, and young adults with constitutional spinal canal stenosis. MRI fi ndings may include swelling, high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images (in relation to edema, demyelinisation or gliosis), hemorrhagic lesions of the cord, ligament or disc injury, and epidural hematoma. MRI is indicated to rule out compressive lesions (post-traumatic disk herniation, compressive hematoma), to demonstrate spinal cord injury, to defi ne a prognosis by showing the extent and severity of spinal cord injury. Repetition of MRI allows evaluation of the natural history of the lesion and of the possible sequellae. Conclusion: This exhibit illustrates the variety of clinical and MRI fi ndings in SCIWORA.",

Miele; Rome/IT (vittoriomiele@alice.it)Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography (CEUS) in diagnosing and characterizing hepato-spleno-renal traumatic injuries in pediatric patients compared to conventional Ultrasonography (US) and Multislice Computed Tomography (MSCT). Methods and Materials: Between January 2003 and December 2005, 103 patients (61 males, 42 females, mean age 6 years) with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) were examinated by conventional US, CEUS and MSCT. Ultrasonography was performed before and after intravenous bolus injection of 2.4 ml of ultrasonographic contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). CT examinations were performed by multislice spiral CT before and after intravenous contrast agent administration. The presence, number, sonographic appearance and conspicuity of hepatic, splenic and renal injuries were then analyzed. Results: In 15/103 patients conventional US identifi ed solid organs injuries: 6 hepatic, 6 splenic and 3 renal injuries. CEUS identifi ed 5 more injuries: 2 hepatic, 1 splenic and 2 renal injuries that was not shown at conventional US. Therefore, CEUS identifi ed traumatic lesions in 20/103 patients. Solid organ injuries appeared strongly hypoechoic at contrast-enhanced US, with surrounding hyperechoic regions. MSCT identifi ed 20 solid organs injuries in 20 patients, according with US results. Conclusion: CEUS greatly increases visualization and characterization of liver, spleen and renal injuries compared with conventional US, and it has a high correlation with MSCT. CEUS should be used as fi rst approach in pediatric blunt abdominal trauma, whereas MSCT still remains the choice method in severe and multiple traumas evaluation.C-719MR imaging of the small intestine in paediatric patients: An overview of technical features and clinical resultsP.

Methods and Materials: Two hundred patients (135 men and 65 women, aged 62\u00b115 years) underwent multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis after injection of contrast medium. Multiplanar reconstruction was done in some cases. Results: Sixty patients (42 men and 18 women) had variations of the right internal IV (IIV) (n=39), left IIV (n=10), both IIVs (n=6), left external IV (EIV) (n=3), or left common IV (CIV) (n=2). The right /left IIV was single (n=10/4) or double (n=35/12). The right single IIV drained into the left CIV (n=7) or common iliac junction (CIJ) (n=2). One of the right double IIVs drained into the left CIV (n=26), right CIV (n=3), or right EIV (n=1). Three patients had a high junction of the left single IIV and EIV. One of the left double IIVs drained into the right CIV (n=2), CIJ (n=1), left CIV (n=3), or left EIV (n=1). The bilateral single or double IIVs jointed together and drained into the left CIV (n=6). The left EIV ran more posteromedially than is typical, and joined the left IIV at a low position (n=3). The left CIV was double (n=1) or absent (n=1).

At higher rates of > 80beat/min, the burst method may further improve the accuracy of calcium measurement. Prevalence of CAC was 76% and 46.5% in CKD patients with and without diabetes, respectively. In the multivariate analysis model for the whole group, age, diabetes and obesity were the major predictors of CAC. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more vessels affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same risk for CAC. Severity of renal dysfunction was a predictor of CAC in the patients without diabetes, but not when diabetes was present. Phosphate levels were predictive of CAC in patients without diabetes, and parathyroid hormone levels were associated with the extent of CAC in patients without diabetes and when all CKD patients were considered.

Procedure Details: Detailed 16-and 64-row slice protocols from the major CT vendors are presented. Parameters highlighted include: test bolus vs. bolus tracking, fi eld of view for imaging native coronaries and bypass grafts, effective mAs, kV, and reconstruction parameters. Optimal acquisition and reconstruction parameters vary across scanner manufacturers; however, the principles of contrast delivery generally remain constant across scanners. The use of contrast media with a higher iodine concentration (370-400 mgI/mL) with 16-or 64-row MDCT enables superior arterial enhancement with a smaller total contrast volume and total iodine dose. Conclusion: Optimised protocols for cardiac MDCT require an understanding of several important parameters. Use of a contrast medium with a higher iodine concentration helps maximize the iodine delivery rate while minimizing the total administered contrast media volume.MDCT fi ndings of cardiac pathology in oncologic patientsM.

Shen 2 ;Purpose: Less-invasive detection and characterization of coronary artery plaque by CT coronary angiography is challenging. In previous studies, CT densities were different between soft and intermediate plaques. A recent study using 16-slice CT, however, reported that there was a considerable overlap. The purpose of this study is to validate the accuracy of 64-slice CT densitometry of soft and intermediate plaque using a pulsating cardiac phantom. HU (p < 0.01). For both soft and intermediate plaques, the densitometry near the arterial lumen was overestimated and higher than those at the center (p < 0.01). For plaque sizes of 50% of the arterial diameter or more, accurate CT densitometry was possible in every case. Conclusion: Coronary artery enhancement has a signifi cant impact on 64-slice CT densitometry of coronary artery plaquea, especially soft ones. A large plaque size, densitometry not near the arterial lumen, intracoronary enhancement of 250 HU and a low heart rate are factors for precise measurement.

Conclusion: Atorvastatin may decrease area of NCP if LDL levels are suffi ciently decreased and may increase CT values, which could suggest a change in NCP components. Further studies are needed using 64-MSCT in a larger population with suffi cient decreases in LDL levels.Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of virtual CT angioscopy in patients with valvular heart diseases. Volume rendered virtual CT angioscopy is useful in the evaluation of valvular heart disease. It offers more realistic information on the architecture of the valves and soft tissue lesions such as pannus and vegetations. The mean of CT values of the RA and RV were signifi cantly lower than the left side heart (P < 0.01) with excellent SD. We could easily obtain coronary arteries without artifact due to high CT values of the RA and RV.

Methods and Materials: Thirteen patients (8 F, 5M; mean age 58 years) with PD symptoms underwent DatScan tomography. MR was performed to exclude cerebrovascular disease (CD). Cardiac I123-MIBG scintigraphy was carried out only in patients showing inconclusive MR and DatScan imaging. Cardiac images were acquired 4 hours after MIBG injection. Semiquantitative analysis was performed calculating heart to mediastinum count-ratio (H/M) by ROIs over the mediastinum and heart. Decrease of cardiac MIBG accumulation indicating degeneration of myocardial sympathetic neurons was detected in idiopathic PD. Therefore, cardiac I123-MIBG scintigraphy may be useful in the diagnosis of PD, expecially when cerebral MR and DatScan imaging is not conclusive.Background: Although echocardiography is a useful method, ECG-gated MDCT and MRI are speculated to provide additional information for the evaluation of aortic stenosis.

A drawback is that only about 10% of the lung parenchyma is scanned, whereas multidetector row CT (MDCT) allows evaluation of whole lung parenchyma with an easier detection of disease. Procedure Details: We retrospectively reviewed the imaging fi ndings of patients with diffuse cystic lesions from our database of thoracic pathology. Examinations were performed with 64 and 16 MDCT. We did MPR reconstruction, MPVR and VR for every patient. Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) helped us to fi nd the planes in which key features are displayed and to identify the main pattern of diffuse lung disease. Minimum intensity projection (MinIP) is especially useful: a better visualization of the airways is fundamental in the diagnosis of cystic bronchiectasis and in the evaluation of distortion in pulmonary fi brosis.

Kim; Seoul/KR (docleo@radiol.snu.ac.kr)    Purpose: 1. To investigate the MR imaging features that can predict seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) by means of the pattern analysis of seminal vesicle lesion (SVL). 2. To evaluate whether pattern analysis of SVL could improve the accuracy for detecting SVI. Methods and Materials: The MR images of 217 patients who underwent Retropubic radical prostatectomy due to prostate cancer between Jan.2004 and Dec. 2005   were retrospectively analyzed, focusing on SVL on T2WI. The SVL on T2-weighted sequences was classifi ed as 5 classes. In each class, the results were correlated with histopathologic fi ndings. Performance characteristics of pattern analysis for predicting SVI were compared with those of conventional ROC analysis and those of serum PSA level. Results: Fourteen (6.5%) of 217 patients had evidence of SVI and 203 (94%) had no SVI. 146 (67%) were classifi ed as having no SVL on MR images, and the remaining 71 (33%) had various classes of SVL. Class I was identifi ed in 16 (23%), II in 24 (34%), III in 14 (20%), IV in 10 (14%), and V in 7 (9.9%). The sensitivity and specifi city of each class for prediction of SVI were calculated. The overall accuracy of pattern analysis was superior to that of PSA level and of conventional ROC analysis (P <.01, McNemar test).Conclusion:The classifi cation of SVL on the basis of their imaging morphologic features can provide objective standard and simplify the abnormal fi ndings for predicting SVI in prostate cancer.

Chevrot; Paris/FR(francois.cornud@cch.aphp.fr)    Learning Objectives: To show the accuracy of transrectal contrast enhanced imaging (ultrasonography and MR) and MR spectroscopy in the localisation of non-palpable prostate cancer and the consequences it can have on cancer detection rate and treatment option.Background: Contrast-enhanced TRUS has shown its ability to detect neovascularisation, which characterises prostate cancer, and to improve cancer detection rate in an early detection program. Contrast-enhanced MRI and MR spectroscopy are effective tools to locate tumors of signifi cant volume in patients with raising PSA level and negative biopsies or in patients with a microcarcinoma (< 3 mm of cancer on a single positive biopsy). Procedure Details: Contrast-enhanced TRUS with low mechanical index and specifi c software sonographic equipment (CPS technique, Acuson, Siemens) is performed after IV bolus injection of microbubbles (Sonovue, Bracco) to detect early focal enhancement within the peripheral or transition zone. A 30' room time MRI protocol has been developed including 3 plane FSET2 sequences, spectroscopy sequence and dynamic MRI after IV injection of gadolinium. Post-processing is done on the commercially available workstation of the manufacturer(Leonardo, Siemens). Several examples will show how posterior and anterior non-palpable tumors can be detected and how only a combination of both MR sequences can achieve a suffi cient degree of accuracy to be recommended to target repeat biopsies. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced TRUS optimizes cancer detection rate during a fi rst set of biopsies. MRI, a second line tool, detects signifi cant volume tumors provided that spectroscopy and contrast sequences are combined.Full comprehensive MR protocol for prostate examination with endorectal coil, including dynamic contrast agent and proton spectroscopyA.

Background: MR examination of prostate is performed to detect prostate cancer in patients with abnormal PSA serum level and ultrasound, with negative or uncertain biopsy results. Moreover, it is used for an accurate local staging of already diagnosed tumor, in particular for the detection of extracapsular spreading. Endorectal coil examination show better image quality and better proton spectroscopy data than body or surface coils. T2-weighted imaging can demonstrate hypointense prostate cancers in the peripheral zone. 1H-MRS can detect the presence of choline or alterated choline/citrate ratio, both signs of prostate cancer presence.

To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of functional MR imaging for prostate cancer imaging. 3. To discuss the incremental value of functional MR imaging in the pretreatment work-up of prostate cancer. Background: Endorectal MR imaging has been widely used for pretreatment work-up of prostate cancer. However, undeniable limitations still remain because this modality is not highly specifi c for accurate cancer localization. Furthermore, this modality is not useful for detecting cancer tissue in the transitional zone and for differentiating cancer tissue from biopsy-related hemorrhage and infl ammation.

McCarthy; Galway/IE (jnimhuircheartaigh@gmail.com)Learning Objectives: To illustrate the spectrum of diagnoses which can be obtained from traditional intravenous urography, an imaging modality which has lost favour in recent years with the advent of CT urography. Background: The intravenous urogram aids in the diagnosis of many urinary pathologies including calculi, malignancy, obstruction and anatomical variants. Although the role of intravenous urography as a primary investigation for many of these indications has been diminished recently, it is still the examination of choice where there is a need to visualize the entire urinary system. During the authors' initial fi ve weeks performing intravenous urograms, we encountered a diverse range of abnormalities which highlighted, for us, the utility of this undervalued investigation. Imaging Findings: Abnormalities demonstrated during this period included pyeloureteritis cystica, renal scarring, pelvico-ureteric junction stenosis, extravasation of contrast, mega-ureter, duplex ureter and a number of calculi causing varying degress of obstruction. Conclusion: While intravenous urography is somewhat out of vogue at present, this series elegantly demonstates that a great deal of relevant information can be obtained from this relatively straighforward study.Urogenital tuberculosis L.

Kim; Jinju/KR (jmkk43@empal.com)    Purpose: Ultrasonography (US) has been known to be diffi cult for evaluation of ureteral stones, especially of mid-ureteral stones. However, color Doppler twinkling artifact (CDTA) frequently found in the urinary stones during the examination of color Doppler US (CDU) could be very useful for diagnosis. We evaluated the usefulness of CDU in diagnosing mid-ureteral stones.Methods and Materials:We prospectively examined CDU with gray scale US (GSU) in 562 consecutive subjects presenting with renal colic to diagnose ureteral stones. The fi nal diagnosis was confi rmed by additional imaging, clinical follow-up, or urological intervention. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. Results: CDU with GSU demonstrated ureteral stones in 437 of 562 subjects that were all confi rmed as having stones. Out of the 437 patients, 41, 133, and 263 showed stones at the mid, upper, and lower ureters, respectively. Of the remaining 125 subjects, seven with ureteroliths (1, 4, and 2 with stones at the mid, upper, and lower ureters, respectively) were missed. Therefore, there was a total of 42 patients with mid-ureteral stones. US revealed stones in 41 patients. But 1 case without hydronephrosis failed to show. CDTA was seen in 39 of the 41 cases (95.1%) and it was not related with size or calcifi cation of stones (p> 0.05). CDU was able to differentiate ureteral stones from stone-like echogenic structures and ureters from vessels. Sensitivity and specifi city of CDU with GSU for diagnosis of mid-ureteral stones were 97.6% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: CDU was very useful for the diagnosis of mid-ureteral stones.MR urography in the diagnosis of obstructive uropathy in selected clinical groups J. Zielonko, M. Markuszewski, M. Studniarek; Gdansk/PL Purpose: To evaluate the role of MRU in the diagnosis of obstructive uropathy in selected clinical groups. Methods and Materials: Sixty patients with obstructive uropathy underwent static fl uid MRU (sMRU), conventional MR sequences, and excretory MRU (12 cases). The degree of the urinary tract dilatation, level and type of obstruction were estimated. Four groups of pathologies were distinguished: calculi, strictures of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), benign and malignancy-induced ureterostenosis.The results were compared with IVU, CT, US, clinical, and histopathological data. For estimation of the agreement between sMRU and other techniques, Cohen's kappa statistic was applied. Results: In patients with urolithiasis, sMRU correctly depicted the degree of ureterohydronephrosis in 85%, in cases of UPJ stenosis and malignancy-induced ureterostenosis the depiction was 100% and in the group of benign ureterostenosis it was 91%. Determination of obstruction level was adequate in 92% of stones and in 100 % of non-calculous ureteral strictures. Completed with conventional MR sequences, sMRU depicted tumour or infi ltration in 83% cases of malignancy-induced ureterostenosis. In the remaining groups, neoplasm was excluded in 91%. Filling defects were verifi ed with IVU/CT to exclude tumours. For evaluation of the agreement between sMRU and other modalities, kappa values were calculated concerning: (a) the degree of ureterohydronephrosis -0.97/0.91 for right/left-sided pathologies, (b) obstruction level -0.97/0.96, (c) type of obstruction -0.93. Conclusion: MRU is a useful technique in the assessment of obstructive uropathy, especially that of non-calculous origin.

To discuss the benefi ts and drawbacks of electronic colon cleansing (ECC). 3. To demonstrate the utility of the translucency-view as a new diagnostic tool. 4. To discuss the role of colon computer-assisted reading (CAR) in the detection and quantifi cation of polyps. Background: Various studies in the past have proved CT colonography as a viable option for colorectal cancer screening. There are challenges and pitfalls in CTC study review that include low sensitivity and specifi city due to the inability to assess the entire colonic surface, poor patient preparation and inability to differentiate between stool residuals and polypoid lesions. Procedure Details: In this exhibit, we demonstrate major advances in 3D visualization techniques, interpretation tools and computer-assisted reading for CTC that might overcome the CTC-related challenges mentioned above: 1. Perspective fi let view -unfolded and unobstructed 3D view of the colon to increase the colonic surface visualization. 2. Electronic colon cleansing -improved sensitivity, specifi city and better reading experience. 3. Translucency view -investigation of polyps, facilitates differentiation between polyps and false positives. 4.Colon CAR -automatic detection and quantifi cation of polyps. Conclusion: 1.

Of the latter, 15.201 (39%) were due to false positive at CTC. The number of therapeutic colonoscopies was reduced by 41.763 to 23.371, corresponding to a 44% drop. However, the number of therapeutic colonoscopies for advanced polyps was similar in the two simulated groups (1.989 vs 2.006), whilst that for removal of not advanced polyps was much higher in the colonoscopy group (39.774 vs 21.365). Conclusion: CTC screening allows a more rational use of endoscopic procedures, substantially reducing the number of negative endoscopies and selecting mainly the high-risk patients -those with advanced pathology -for polypectomy.Magnetic resonance colonography: Comparison between T1-high resolution isotropic volume excitation (THRIVE) and balanced fast fi eld echo (bFFE) using a water-gadolinium enema or air enema M.

Antonopoulos, K. Tavernaraki, F. Constantinidis, E. Kalikatzaros, G. Charalampopoulos, A. Petroulakis; Marousi/GR (sandytav@ath.forthnet.gr)Learning Objectives: To demonstrate specifi c CT fi ndings, the combination of which provides a safe diagnosis of gangrenous appendicitis. Background: Gangrenous appendicitis is the result of appendiceal lumen obstruction, which if left untreated, leads to perforation of the appendiceal wall and peritonitis. Thus, it is of crucial importance to promptly diagnose and surgically treat this emergency condition. In a three year period, 65 patients (mean age 48 years, age range 16-80) with clinical and laboratory fi ndings suggestive of acute appendicitis were evaluated with Helical CT. Diagnosis of gangrenous appendicitis was based on a combination of specifi c imaging fi ndings, which were surgically anf pathologically confi rmed. Imaging Findings: Five different combinations of specifi c CT fi ndings suggestive of gangrenous appendicitis were observed in our study. Enlargement of the appendix was visualised in all patients accompanied by: 1. Intraluminal appendicolith and air bubbles (30.8%). 2. Infl ammatory involvement of caecum and terminal ileum (18.5%). 3. Intraluminal appendicolith and infl ammatory involvement of caecum and terminal ileum (16.9%). 4. Intraluminal air bubbles (15.4%). 5. Intraluminal appendicolith and diffuse peritonitis (13.8%). In three patients (4.6%), the diagnosis of gangrenous appendicitis was made surgically and pathologically, since none of the above combinations of CT fi ndings were observed. Conclusion: Our study suugests fi ve different combinations of specifi c CT fi ndings, which can provide a safe diagnosis of gangrenous appendicitis, thus resulting in prompt surgical treatment, before rupture of the appendix and other serious associated complications occur.CT-colonography (CTC): Which are the right scanner parameters to use?

Ilharco; Coimbra/PT  (henriquerds@sapo.pt)    Learning Objectives: To demonstrate the capacities of single contrast esophagography in the diagnosis and characterization of esophageal benign diseases. Background: Despite the current focus on cross-sectional imaging studies such as computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance, barium examination continues to be the primary radiologic modality for the evaluation of patients with clinical fi ndings of esophageal disease. Procedure Details: We made a retrospective review of barium studies performed at our institution in the last year in patients with complains of dysphagia, odynophagia or pyrosis. Studies are always done after 6 hours of fasting, with a 50% w/v barium suspension or iodated oral contrast when wall discontinuity was suspect. Exams are performed under fl uoroscopic control, and images are obtained in upright left posterior oblique and right posterior oblique position. Decubitus positioning and postural manoeuvres are usually tried when refl ux, hernia, or motility disorders are suspected. With our iconography, we present a pictorial review of Zenker's, traction and epiphrenic diverticulums, webs, rings, varices, failure of cricopharygeus relaxation, achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, hernias with and without association with gastric volvulus, caustic or peptic stenosis, candida esophagitis, giant fi brovascular polyp, fi stulas with pleural or bronchial communication and vascular extrinsic compressions. Conclusion: Single contrast esophagography is an available, rapid, cost-effective and relatively innocuous exam, which permits a good representation of esophagus morphology, distensibility and contractility.Enhancement pattern of metastatic lymph node of esophageal cancer using thin-section MDCT K. Shuto, S. Okazumi, K. Hayano, T. Aoyagi, K. Narushima, A. Sato, T. Ochiai, N. Yanagawa; Chiba/JP Purpose: To evaluate the enhancement pattern of metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes (LN) of esophageal cancer using thin-section MDCT to establish adjuvant CT criteria for metastasis. Methods and Materials: Clinical evaluation: Fifty-three consecutive patients who underwent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) were enrolled. MDCT with 1.25 mm thickness was performed prior to and 3 weeks after CRT. The enhancement pattern of LNs were classifi ed into 3 types prior to CRT; solid type (type S): isodensity with regular margin, irregular type (type I): mosaic enhancement with spicular or unclear margin, rim type (type R): hypodensity with peripheral enhancement. LNs were defi ned as metastatic with change in size over \u00b150%. We established adjuvant CT criteria evaluating enhancement pattern. Histological Evaluation: another 50 consecutive patients underwent radical esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy. LNs were assessed prior to surgery based on the CT criteria, and compared with histological fi ndings subsequently. Results: Clinical metastasis and CT fi ndings: In a total of 421LNs, 14% of type S, 67% of type I and 91% of type R were assessed as metastatic with statistical difference (P < 0.0001). We established adjuvant criteria with the results as follows: round-shaped type S over 10 mm, round-shaped type I, or any type R. Adjuvant CT criteria in comparison with histological fi ndings: 1029 LNs were dissected and evaluated histologically. When the criteria were applied, the sensitivity was 84% and the specifi city was 98%. Conclusion: Using these adjuvant CT criteria, the diagnostic value of CT may improve compared to previous reports of poor sensitivity due to infl ammation and anthracosis.Pictorial review of achalasia and pseudoachalasia: A diagnostic conundrum N.K.K.

In addition, the study of the LAM activity, the emptying of bladder and anorectum to better understand the mechanism of this pathology. Background: In patients with incontinence disturbances, dynamic MRI and Colpocystodefecography allow to study both the statics of pelvic organs and the features of MRI anatomy and function of LAM. Besides, we illustrate the advantages and the role of Dynamic MRI in comparison to Colpocystodefecography in studiyng pelvic fl oor involvement in incontinence disorders. Dynamic MRI was carried out with the supine patient in different pelvic fl oor manoveurs by MRI T2-weighted scans in Breathe Hold. Imaging Findings: Dynamic MRI and Colpocystodefecography assessed 20 perineal descent syndromes, 12 rectoceles, 13 cistoceles, 10 rectal wall prolapses, 5 rectal intussusceptions. MRI enlargement of LAM hiatus as a wide cone appeared in 19 cases; LAM was thin in 6 cases and with MRI alterated signal in 3 cases. At Colpocystodefecography, the anal canal caliber was larger in 15 patients with a mean diameter of 27 mm (range 18-33 mm). Conclusion: Compared to Colpocystodefecography, Dynamic MRI of Pelvic Floor represents a non-invasive, useful and rapid investigation for the evaluation of the incontinence subjects.

Background: Small bowel investigation represents a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. MDCT-enteroclysis (MDCT-E) seems to be a reliable method to study the small intestine; however, some different techniques can be used to perform the examination. The imaging records and charts of 122 patients submitted to MDCT-enteroclysis from January 2004 and July 2006 for suspected small bowel disease, confi rmed by this examination as well as by clinical/surgical fi ndings, have been reviewed. The techniques, indications and results achieved are described and illustrated. Procedure Details: All examinations have been performed used a 16-detector row CT, after positioning of a naso-jejunal tube under fl uoroscopic guidance. Different enteric contrast media have been used, depending from clinical suspicion: methylcellulose (35 patients), water (37 patients), iodinated water-soluble contrast solution (18), air (32). All examinations have been reviewed on a dedicated workstation, using multiplanar reconstructions. Focused description and illustration of the different pathological fi ndings (i.e.parietal thickening, endoluminal or extraparietal lesional mass, fi stulas) are provided.

Background: In 1886, the French pathologist Troisier described the palpable metastatic involvement of left supraclavicular lymph nodes as an \"early\" sign of gastric cancer. Tumor cells spread along the thoracic duct till its venous injection and colonised the supraclavicular nodes. Procedure Details: We illustrate the clinical and imaging (USy, CT, MRI, and/or PET) fi ndings in patients with thoraco-abdominal tumours and left supraclavicular lymphatic spread. The exams of patients with advanced tumours of breast, lung, thymus, stomach, colon, and ovary are shown.

To evaluate the common differential diagnosis. 4. To review optimal imaging techniques in assessment of carotid tumours. 5. To explain the role and techniques of interventional procedures in management of carotid body tumours. Background: Carotid body tumours occur at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery and are glomus tumours arising from normal tissue of the carotid body. Carotid body is a paraganglia and the tumours are highly vascularised, with clusters of tumour cells surrounded by dense network of capillary calibre blood vessels. Imaging plays a vital role in diagnosis and treatment of these tumours. Imaging Findings: The review discusses the normal anatomy and physiology of carotid body. The pictorial reiew illustrates the imaging appearances of carotid tumour in ultrasound, Doppler, multislice CT, CT angiography, MRI, MR angiography and somatostain scintigraphy. The techniques of interventional procedures for treatment of carotid body tumours is also discussed and illustrated. Follow-up and clinical outcomes of carotid body embolisation is discussed with brief review of literature. Conclusion: MRI and MR angiography are the main investigative modalities used in diagnosis of carotid body tumours. Widening of carotid bifurcation is an important feature that distinguishes carotid body tumour from other masses such as neurofi bromas. Salt and pepper appearance due to fl ow void is another specifi c feature. Embolisation is used to reduce tumour vascularity, before surgical removal of carotid tumours.",

B D E F A GMethods and Materials:The study included 112 patients aged 0-14 yrs. We used scanners with 3-5 MHz convex, 5-8 MHz microconvex and 5-12 MHz linear array transducers. Conventional radiography preceded all US studies. Results: Pleural collections were identifi ed in 81patients with pneumonia. Fluid was anechoic in 18 cases, contained debris/septations in 51 patients and had a honeycomb-like appearance in 12 patients. Metastatic disease was confi rmed in 1 patient. The underlying lung parenchyma was adequately evaluated in 72/82 patients and the assessment of air/fl uid bronchogram and parenchymal vascularity allowed the diagnosis of atelectasis/consolidation. Hypoechoic parenchymal lesions were noted in 11patients and abscesses in 3 cases. Mediastinal enlargement was due to thymus in 12 patients and to nodal enlargement in 1 patient. One case of ganglioneuroblastoma and two of neuroblastoma were visualized. A diaphragmatic hernia was confi rmed in 1patient. Three vascular malformations, 1 lymphangioma, 1 lipoma, 1 chondrosarcoma, 1 fi brosarcoma, 1 Ewing's sarcoma, 1 neurofi broma and 1 rib fracture were evaluated.

Abdel Razek, A. Galal; Mansoura/EG (arazek@mans.eun.eg) Purpose: To determine the role of diffusion-weighted MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy of the brain in pediatric patients with chronic liver disease. Methods and Materials: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) & multivoxel proton MR spectroscopy of the brain were done for 37 pediatric patients (22 m, 15 f, aged 4-14 ys, mean 9 ys) with chronic liver disease and 20 volunteers as control. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was done using a single shot echo planar imaging with a diffusion-weighted factor b of 0, 500 and 1000 sec/mm 2 . The apparent diffusion coeffi cient (ADC) map was reconstructed. Proton MR spectroscopy (multivoxel PRESS technique: TR/TE=1500/135, 1.6\u00d71.6 matrix, FOV=100 mm, 2 averages) was performed at the level of the most signifi cant MR abnormality. Assignment of the resonance peaks of NAA, creatine, choline, glutamate, myionositol, lipid and lactate was determined in the basal ganglion, thalamus, grey and white matter. Results: Restricted diffusion (high SI at high diffusion-weighted images and low SI at ADC maps) within the corticospinal tract in hepatic encephalopathy (n=14), putamen and caudate nucleus in Wilson disease (n=4) and frontal and occipital white matter in Gauchers disease (n=2). MR spectra revealed increased glutamate with decreased myoinositol and choline peaks in hepatic encephalopathy. Wilson disease showed decreased choline & myoinositol that associated with lactate. MR spectra in Gaucher's disease revealed presence of lipid and lactate. Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging and proton MR spectroscopy added valuable information to routine MR imaging of the brain in pediatric patients with chronic liver disease.",

Cowan, M.A. Rutherford; London/UK Purpose: The most common imaging abnormality in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) are lesions within the basal ganglia and thalami (BGT). These are associated with motor impairments in the form of cerebral palsy. A minority of neonates sustain mainly white matter lesions. There have been no reports of outcomes in these infants. The aim of this study was to categorise the severity of the white matter lesions in this group and to compare with neurodevelopmental outcome. Methods and Materials: In a cohort, 270 infants with HIE who underwent neonatal magnetic resonance imaging between 1991-2000 in our unit 64 had no evidence of BGT lesions and were eligible for the study. Conventional images were assessed for severity and distribution of lesions. Neurodevelopmental outcome was measured using Griffi ths developmental scales and a structured neurological examination. Results: Of the 64 infants, 41% were females and 59% males. The mean gestational age was 40.2 (range 36-42) weeks. Neurodevelopmental outcome was obtained at a mean of 36.4 months. White matter classifi cation was as follows: 28% normal, 31% mild, 22% moderate, 19% severe. There was a signifi cant relationship between severity of WM lesions and both neurological and developmental outcome. Generalised developmental delay was common and increased with increasing severity of white matter lesions (p=0.01). Motor impairments in the form of cerebral palsy were not common. Eight infants developed cerebral palsy, six of whom had severe WM changes. Conclusion: Isolated WM lesions are relatively uncommon following hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy but are associated with signifi cant developmental impairment.Identifi cation of adrenocorticotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas in children and adolescents with Cushing disease by SPGR sequence on magnetic resonance imagingN.A.

Methods and Materials: Data were analyzed retrospectively from a series of patients seen over 7 years. Thirty children and adolescents with Cushing disease (13 females and 17 males with a mean age of 12\u00b13 yrs) were studied. Imaging fi ndings were compared with surgical and pathological fi ndings in all cases. Results: Twenty-eight patients had microadenomas and two had macroadenomas; the latter were identifi ed by both MRI techniques. Precontrast SE and SPGR-MRI identifi ed four and six of the microadenomas, respectively. Postcontrast SPGR-MRI identifi ed the location of the tumor in 18 of 28 patients, whereas postcontrast SE-MRI identifi ed demonstrated microadenomas in only fi ve patients (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Contrast enhanced conventional MRI mostly failed to identify ACTHsecreting microadenomas in children and adolescents with Cushing disease. Postcontrast SPGR-MRI was superior to SE-MRI in tumor identifi cation and should be used in addition to conventional SE-MRI in the pituitary imaging of children and adolescents with suspected Cushing disease.Pediatric facial fractures: Seek and you shall fi ndA.

We reviewed our own cases from 1990 to 2006. Procedure Details: Transcranial US, CT, MR, CTA, MRA and DSA were performed. Clipping and Coiling were used as treatment options. Conclusion: A clinical and non-invasive imaging diagnosis approach is possible, although DSA is still crucial to plan the treatment.Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in oligohydramnios: Detection of pulmonary hypoplasia and clinical outcome A. Pataraia, G. Kasprian, A. Messerschmidt, P. Brugger, H. Helmer, D. Prayer; Vienna/AT (a.pataraia@gmail.com)Purpose: Prolonged oligo/anhydramnios may lead to pulmonary hypoplasia. In this follow-up study, we used MR volumetry and the assessment of signal intensities to detect fetuses with restricted lung development, and correlated our results with the postnatal outcome. Methods and Materials: Twenty-three singleton pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios underwent MRI between the eighteenth gestational week (GW) and birth (mean 27.8 GW). Fetal lung volumes, body volumes and the amount of amniotic fl uid were measured and compared to the results of 244 measurements in normal fetuses.",

Pozzi Mucelli; Verona/IT (rmanfredi@univr.it)    Purpose: To determine the capability of MR imaging in evaluating agenesis of fetal corpus callosum in fetuses with mild cerebral ventriculomegaly at US. Methods and Materials: 29 fetuses (mean gestational week:28.9; range17-37) with US diagnosis of mild ventriculomegaly (mean value11.6; range 10-15) prospectively underwent MR imaging. The mean US/MR interval was 3.1 weeks. Post-natal references standard was: ultrasonography and clinical evaluation in all cases, autopsy MR imaging in 2/29patients. MR imaging data were compared to gold standard. Qualitative image analysis included: ventricular confi guration (normal/parallel), agenesis of the corpus callosum (total/partial:1/3.2/3.3/3), signal intensity changes of the nervous tissue. Quantitative image analysis included: diameter of the trigones of the lateral ventricles (left and right) and cerebral cortex thickness. Results: 19/29 (66%) fetuses showed a normal confi guration of lateral ventricle while 10/29 (34%) fetuses showed parallel confi guration. Corpus callosum was completely present in 17/29 (58%) fetuses, 4/29 (14%) showed partial agenesis while 8/29 (28%) total agenesis. Compared to post-natal imaging (US/MR), 2 partial agenesis of the corpus callosum were misinterpreted: in one case overestimated and in the other case underestimated. The mean left lateral ventricle diameter was 11.8 mm (range 6-19 mm), the mean right lateral ventricle diameter was 11.5 mm (range 8-17 mm). The mean thickness of the cerebral cortex was 2.13 mm (range 1.8-3 mm). None of the fetuses showed signal intensity alterations of the nervous tissue. Conclusion: Mild ventriculomegaly associated with corpus callosum agenesis occurred in 12/26 fetuses (46%). Total agenesis of the corpus callosum was detected in all cases; whereas partial agenesis was 2/4 patients.Optimisation of dose and image quality in digital pediatric voiding cystourethrography E. Vano-Galvan, R. Sanchez Jacob, E. Vano, J. Fernandez Soto; Madrid/ES (eliseovano@yahoo.es) Purpose:(1) To compare dose and image quality of two samples of digital pediatric voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) examinations performed by the same radiologist using two different X-ray systems and dose settings. (2) To discuss radiographic techniques that provide an optimal balance between dose and image quality (ALARA criteria). Methods and Materials: Dose-area product (DAP), fl uoroscopy time and number of images of 192 and 93 VCUGs from two different digital X-ray systems have been registered. A sample of 20 procedures from each group (selected in the 0-1 year age band) is evaluated blindly by two radiologists, scoring image quality using European and American criteria. Differences between DAP and fl uoroscopy time in the two groups were analysed for signifi cance using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Image quality scores were compared by means of the Wilcoxon-signed rank test. A qualitative analysis of the results is also made. Results: The medians of the DAP distributions were 12.1 and 3.0 cGy*cm 2 for the two X-ray systems included in the study, meaning that there is a statistically signifi cant difference (p < 0.05). There were no statistically signifi cant differences in diagnostic information between both samples. Measured dose values for both samples are lower if compared with the current literature. Detailed technical factors of each equipment are analyzed. Conclusion: An important reduction of dose may be achieved with digital VCUG, and patient dose can be reduced (without compromising diagnostic information)",

Martinez de la Cuesta; Pamplona/ES (cbhernan@unav.es)    Learning Objectives: To describe the classifi cation system of vascular anomalies. To explain the imaging techniques and radiological fi ndings in the diagnosis of vascular anomalies and the different therapeutic options. Background: Vascular anomalies have a high incidence at birth. Imaging studies are necessary to orientate and/or confi rm the diagnosis and to establish their extension. Diagnostic imaging techniques include: plain fi lms, Doppler ultrasound, Angio-computerised tomography, Angio-magnetic resonance, and angiographic techniques (arteriography, phlebography). Imaging Findings: Hemangiomas are tumours that show diffuse gadolinium enhancement. Sometimes, an arterial fl ow is seen with Doppler. Arteriovenous Malformations on MRI have enlarged arterial and venous fl ow signal voids centered about a nidus. Venous malformations have lumena which are characteristically seen to enlarge on bipedestation with Doppler ultrasound. These lesions show high T2 signal intensity on MRI. Gadolinium enhancement is typical and phleboliths are frequent. Conclusion: MR is the fi rst choice imaging technique. It is able, as well as CT, to evaluate with precision the extension and anatomic correlations. Doppler ultrasound examinations offer anatomical and hemodinamic information. Angiography is a useful diagnostic and also therapeutic technique. Each technique has its indications and limitations. Thus, it is necessary to individualize the type of technique used as different techniques offer complementary information.The role of sonography in the study of thoracic and abdominal wall in childhood M.

To review the imaging techniques used in the evaluation of these lesions. Background: Lumps and bumps of the buttock in children often pose a diagnostic dilemma. A proper diagnosis is of paramount importance, because therapeutic implications can vary signifi cantly. The purpose of our study is to review the differential diagnosis and to present the MRI fi ndings of a variety of entities that show with physical anomalies in the backside of children. Imaging Findings: A wide spectrum of congenital lesions such as hemangiomas, lipomas (isolated or associated with congenital anomalies of the spine), lipoblastoma, sacrococcygeal teratoma and other germ cell tumors, PNET, rabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and plexiform neurofi broma are seen. Gluteal fi brosis, subcutaneous fat atrophy or traumatic lesions (hematoma, subcutaneous fat necrosis) are found. Venous and lymphatic malformations (isolated or associated with other overgrowth syndromes such as Proteus Syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber, Parkes-Weber) are seen. Conclusion: Children presenting with a lump on the buttock often request radiological evaluation. Radiography and ultrasonography are often the initial screening diagnostic tests, followed by MRI.

Nicolas; Bochum/DE (christoph.heyer@rub.de)    Purpose: Myopathies present with a broad diagnostic spectrum, which may ultimately require muscle biopsy. MRI has been established as a non-invasive method in diagnosing adult myopathies; not only does MRI reveal characteristic fi ndings that point in a diagnostic direction, but it also aids in determining optimal biopsy sites and controlling therapeutic interventions. Muscle MRI is increasingly fi nding application in pediatric myopathies, especially dystrophies and myositides. The following exhibit serves to illustrate the use of MRI using exemplary clinical vignettes. Methods and Materials: From 1999 to 2006, 180 children with myopathies of unknown aetiology, aged 14 months to 18 years, were examined with a standardised MRI protocol (axial T1-SE and T2-weigted TIRM sequences). The protocol included imaging of the lower extremities, whereas sequences displaying the upper extremities were only acquired in selected patients. Furthermore, intravenous contrast agent was only administered in selected children. Results: All investigations could be performed without sedation due to an examination time of 12-15 minutes. The illustrated cases of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, dermatomyositis, pyomyositis, and chronic neurogenic disease with secondary myopathy all showed disease-characteristic MRI patterns, which substantially helped reach the ultimate diagnosis. Conclusion: Muscle MRI is a non-invasive and effective instrument in helping diagnose pediatric myopathies of unknown aetiology. It may facilitate muscle biopsy and serves to control therapeutical effects and disease course. Furthermore, muscle MRI may be applicable even to children of less than 4 years of age without sedation.Ultrasound imaging after wrist and distal forearm trauma in children with no fractures detected on plain fi lms D.M.

Chateil 1 ;Purpose: This study evaluates the potential role of ultrasonography in paediatric patients with a post-traumatic elbow joint effusion without fracture on initial radiographs. Methods and Materials: Twelve consecutive children (age range: 4-15 years), whose post-traumatic elbow radiographs showed an effusion without fracture, underwent an emergency screening (in the fi rst 48 hours) with an ultrasonography and an MRI. The aim of sonography was to look for a lipohemarthrosis, which is synonymous with cortical fracture. The MR imaging was the reference to differentiate fractures from bone or muscular contusions. Results: Five children (5/12 -42%) had a lipohemarthrosis on ultrasonography, and in all cases we found cortical fractures on MRI. Conversely, the other children (7/12 -58%) had simple hemarthrosis on ultrasonography and no cortical fractures on MRI. Conclusion: Post-traumatic elbow joint effusion of paediatric patients is not synonymous with fracture. Ultrasonography appears to be a reliable, accurate, available and low-cost effective method for the evaluation of occult cortical fractures. The diagnostic clue is the detection of a lipohemarthrosis in the articular recess.Clinical applications of musculoskeletal ultrasound in children and adolescents: Technique description, diagnosis and therapeutic relevance J.A.

Methods and Materials: Patient skin dose was measured for 392 interventional procedures -neurologial, cardiac, and hepatic. Fluoroscopy time, KAP and maximum entrance air kerma (MSK) were measured for each procedure according to a commonly agreed methodology. MSK was evaluated exposing large radiochromic fi lm during the procedure, and in one centre skin dose monitors were additionally used. Results: In 62 procedures (15.8%) the MSK was > 2 Gy, and in 15 (3.8%) it was > 4 Gy. The maximum MSK was 6.6 Gy; of the 62 cases, 39 were PTCA, 7 were RF ablation, 5 were neuro-embolisation and 10 were hepatic interventions. Thirty-nine occurred in 2 hospitals. The skin dose monitor was shown to underestimate MSK. Conclusion: This multinational study has identifi ed a number of interventional procedures resulting in patient skin doses exceeding 2 Gy. Most high-dose procedures were concentrated in 2 hospitals and were associated with: (i) the use of old equipment not designed for modern dose-effi cient applications, (ii) long fl uoroscopy duration and a large number of cine frames for cardiac procedures, (iv) lack of use of transparent fi lters, and (v) over imposition of several beams on the same skin area. The study has demonstrated the benefi ts of large area radiochromic dosimeters over skin dose monitors. The study highlights the importance of periodic skin dose evaluation.",

Papailiou; Athens/GR (chatri@mycosmos.gr) Purpose: Patient dosimetry during CT interventional procedures is a complex task due to the complexity and severity of case, patient's physical characteristics, different specifi cations of CT scanner used and radiologist's experience. Slow verifi cation fi lms used in radiotherapy have been successfully used for some years in Interventional Cardiology to assess patient skin radiation dose. The purpose of this study was to test the suitability of slow verifi cation fi lms in CT guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation.Methods and Materials:The study includes 12 RF liver ablation procedures performed in the CT department of Agia Olga hospital. Patient skin dose was assessed by means of Kodak X-Omat verifi cation fi lms placed on the patient table so as not to interfere with the procedure. The technical factors recorded were: tube kilovoltage (kVp), tube load (mAs), slice thickness and total number of slices. Calibration of fi lms was done using thermoluminescent dosimeters attached to the fi lm, so as to correspond optical density to radiation dose. Results: Maximum skin dose (MSD) delivered to patients ranged from 129 mGy to 165 mGy with a median value of 135 mGy. Corresponding optical density had a range of 1.16-1.48, with a median value of 1.26. Total number of slices had a range of 108-175 with a median of 155 slices. A signifi cant correlation was found between total number of slices and radiation dose (r = 0.71).

Reichenbach; Jena/DE (Reinhard.Rzanny@med.uni-jena.de)    Purpose: MR scanners adjust receiver gain and FFT scaling factors depending on the signal intensity emitted by the sample. Therefore, no simple linear relationship between signal intensity and voxel volume or sample concentration exists commonly. To assess the reliability of absolute metabolic concentrations, as determined by the LC model, single volume, 1 H-MR spectroscopy was analysed with different reference substances, concentrations, and voxel volumes. Methods and Materials: Single voxel spectroscopy (PRESS; TE=135 ms, TR=5000 ms) of three different reference solutions (alcohol, acetate and chloroform) was conducted at 1.5 T (Magnetom Vision, Siemens) using the standard head coil. The phantom consisted of two concentric spherical fl asks with an aqueous cupric-sulphate solution in the outer fl ask (500 ml, 1000 ml or 2000 ml) and the reference solution in the inner fl ask (approx. 40 ml). Measurements were performed with different receiver and transmitter adjustments. Results: By dividing the signal intensity by the total receiver gain and multiplying it with the FFT scaling factor linear relationships were reconstituted when plotted as a function of voxel volume or sample concentration. From the known total receiver gain, FFT scale and known reference concentrations a calibration parameter p was determined. With this calibration parameter, unknown concentrations can then be easily calculated from the measured MR signal and the actual scanner settings. Conclusion: Spectroscopic MR signal intensities can vary largely due to different signal amplifi cations for optimal adjustment of the dynamic range.

To read and decode technical information from MR images. 5. To recognize different MR sequences artefact fi ngerprints. Background: With the continuous advent of new sequences among the magnetic resonance imaging armamentarium, it is hard to keep up with their names and applications. A few simple tricks however allow to recognize correctly the sequences employed in most exams. Conclusion: Newcomers to the MR imaging fi eld struggle among the wealth of sequences. Making the wrong assumptions regarding sequences used can yield wrong conclusions, and inadequate sequence selection can make pathology nonvisible. This exhibit is designed to help you understand the process of sequence selection and recognition.",

To review the clinical application of high-resolution 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography in vascular disorders of the upper extremity. Background: Delineation of arterial disorders of the upper extremity usually done with conventional angiography. Recently, contrast-enhanced MR imaging was used for imaging of vascular disorders of extremity. Procedure Details: High-resolution three-dimensional Contrast-Enhanced MR Angiography (CE-MRA) of the upper extremity was performed in 61 patients with clinically suspected vascular disorders after bolus injection of Gadolinium. CE-MRA detects level, extent and degree of atherosclerosis occlusion and collalaterals, which are essential for treatment planning. Emboli, vasculitis, Burger's disease, Raynaud's disease and steal syndrome are well demonstrated with this technique. It creates pre-operative mapping to classify vascular malformation and manages traumatic injury. Also, it can identify aneurysm and tumor blush in malignancy.

Healy; London/UK (drchew@doctors.net.uk) Purpose: Open or closed reduction is undertaken to facilitate normal hip growth in children with DDH. However, a proportion of children who undergo hip reduction fail to develop deep well-formed acetabuli. These children will need to undergo pelvic osteotomy to improve cover of the femoral head and thereby reduce risk of premature osteoarthritis. We ascertain if the presence of abnormalities on MRI immediately after hip reduction can predict long term hip dysplasia, therefore, aiding surgical fore-planning and reducing need for follow-up radiographs. Methods and Materials: Nineteen hips with DDH were followed up over 4 years. All had initial reduction and post-reduction MRI. MRI fi ndings of 13 hips where acetabular dysplasia resolved by age four were compared with the 6 hips that underwent pelvic osteotomy for unresolving dysplasia. Cartilage anlage shape, bony acetabular index, acetabular anteversion, lateral displacement due to panniculus, ligamentum teres and transverse ligament thickness, and whether the acetabular labrum was in a normal position or folded into the joint were were analysed and compared. The scans were analysed by two consultant musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the outcome of each child. Results: Statistical analysis found none of the abnormalities on MRI were predictive of persisting acetabular dysplasia in the older child. Conclusion: Although post reduction MRI demonstrates anatomical abnormalities secondary to DDH, none of these were predictive of long term acetabular dysplasia. This suggests that the factors determining long term outcome are not visible on MRI, but perhaps due to poor muscle dynamics or a biomolecular abnormality.",

Raupp; Al Ain/Abu Dhabi/ AE (rlanger@uaeu.ac.ae) Learning Objectives: To illustrate radiological fi ndings in the subgroup of patients with Stuewe-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS), surviving the second year. Background: SWS is a rare skeletal dysplasia. Mutations responsible have been recently identifi ed. The prevalence is high in the UAE (0.5/10,000 birth). Most SWS patients die before the age of 2. Out of 24 SWS patients, 6 survived the second year. All came for regular orthopedic and pediatric checkups, or were admitted due to respiratory distress. Patients received follow-up bone and chest radiographs; 1 underwent CCT. Our fi ndings have been compared to few published data. Imaging Findings: All children showed congenital dwarfi sm with progressive bowing of the extremities and demineralization. Three had metaphyseal enlargements with coarse trabeculae. Three developed progressive (kypho)-scoliosis and one spontaneous fracture. Three children showed fragmented epiphyses. Epiphyseal fl attening occurred in 4 patients. Metacarpals and metatarsals were shortened and undertubulated. One patient developed an osteonecrosis of the talus. Rips were broadened and osteoporotic with old fractures. All survivors repeatedly received chest radiographs due to aspirations, pulmonary infections, and pneumonias. Two patients expired subsequently; they died from respiratory insuffi ciency. One girl developed a neurological defi cit due to left frontal infarction, which was caused by hypoxia. Conclusion: While Maroteaux reported a mean survival time of 2 months, several cases surviving infancy have been published, and are under surveillance. SWS survivors after the second year show progressive bowing of the extremities with osteoporosis, a tendency to fractures, metaphyseal abnormalities, and severe (kypho)-scoliosis. Pulmonary infections are less frequent after the second year. Conclusion: The image plates will tested more with the phantom and after that the results will be tested with clinical use. The experienced radiology will analyse the image quality. The results will be introduced. These fi rst tests showed that it is possible to optimise the radiation dose and image quality easily according to the DIMONDIII process.",

Sasaki; Otaru city, Purpose: Reducing patient exposure dose is important in CT colonography. In a previous study (ECR 2005) , we studied laboratory models and found that scanning with an air SD value (standard deviation value in the acrylic part) of approximately 35 or more results in poor visualization. Air SD values vary according to patient size. In the present study, we investigated optimization of the patient exposure dose by adjusting the dose according to patient weight. Methods and Materials: Patients were examined using a 16-row multidetector CT scanner and a 3D workstation. Patient weight was measured before CT colonography. Scanning was performed with an extremely low dose of 5 mAs (70 patients) or 15 mAs (37 patients), and the air SD values in the colon were determined in the upper abdomen and in the pelvic cavity. Scan conditions were 120 kV, 1.0-mm scan slice thickness, and 1.0-mm reconstruction slice thickness. Results: A positive correlation was observed between patient weight and air SD values in the colon. The correlation coeffi cients were 0.74 and 0.73 in the upper abdomen and 0.69 and 0.72 in the pelvic cavity for extremely low-dose scanning at 5 mAs and 15 mAs, respectively. Conclusion: Our previous study (ECR 2005) showed that air SD values of approximately 35 or more result in poor visualization, making it diffi cult to observe the tissue surface. The present study has shown that adjusting the dose according to patient weight is useful for optimizing the patient exposure dose in low-dose scanning while maintaining good visualization.",

Recently, automatic determination of radiation dose (auto-mA) in CT scans has been developed. The purpose of this study was to determine optimal noise level at auto-mA. Methods and Materials: Questionnaire was mailed to 99 institutions that have 16-slice MDCT. The questions were usage of auto-mA, and the setting of noise level when it was used. A basic study was performed with small and large phantoms. The small (S)-phantom was a low-contrast phantom and 20 cm in diameter. The large (L)-phantom was made of the low-contrast phantom rolled with water-polymer absorber material. This was 35 cm in diameter. The largest diameter of the lesions demonstrating more than two-third of their profi le was searched. Results: Fifty-one institutions answered the survey. In 76% institutions, auto-mA was used and the standard deviation (SD) of auto-mA set between 6 and 15, but it was set constant in each institution. On phantom study when SD was set at 8, the largest profi le of lesions in L-phantom was 10 mm, while that in S-phantom was 12.5 mm. When SD was set at 10, the largest profi le of lesions in L-phantom was 12.5 mm, while that in S-phantom was 15.0 mm. Conclusion: Although SD of auto-mA was set constant in many institutions, phantom study suggested different optimal SDs depending on patients' body habitus.",

Oskarsdottir 1 , S. Sigurdsson 1 , L. Purpose: Automated segmentation of brain tissue on MR images is critical to accomplishing analyses of MR scans acquired in large population-based studies, but manually labeled tissue is needed to check the accuracy of the algorithms. Here we describe a method for manual labeling of brain tissues on MR images and assess the reproducibility of the method. Methods and Materials: The brain tissues on the MR images were labeled using \"BorderLine\", a software drawing tool specially designed for the AGES-Reykjavik study. BorderLine uses a Wacom pen tablet as a human interface device for drawing and labeling anatomical landmarks. The tablet comes with a computerized pen interface and a drawing board, allowing the user to label multiple ROIs or tissue classes based on a multi-modal set of registered brain images. Intra-rater variability was assessed based on 2 repeated measures from one observer on 5 pre-defi ned slices of the brain for cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and white matter lesions (WML), based on the 4 following MR sequences: 3D SPGR T1, FSE PD/T2, and FLAIR T2. The intra-rater variability was calculated for each tissue class and each slice location individually using kappa statistics describing spatial agreement (Dice Similarity Coeffi cient). Results: Kappa agreement for all tissue classes and all slice locations was excellent (mean k=0.856\u00b10.088 and mean k=0.899\u00b10.009, respectively).

Computer group students scored signifi cantly higher on their posttest (M=80.5, SD=9.4) when compared with the textbook group (M=61.3, SD=12.5, p=.003), while they seem to appreciate multimedia modules more when compared to textbook students (p=.003). The textbook learning group was equally satisfi ed with their method of instruction in comparison to the computer group (p=.230). Students' rationale for expanding the use of multimedia in physics education seemed to focus on issues concerning motivation, instructional capabilities and content. Conclusion: Interactive animations are a useful and effective aid for teaching MRI principles. The study demonstrated that the inclusion of properly designed multimedia modules enhances conceptual understanding far more than traditional methods do.",

            "text": "Atlas of normal and variant abdominal arteries. 3D anatomy with 64 channel multidetector-CT P. Sedati, G. Pelle, M. Telesca, F. Macr\u00ec, A. Napoli, C. Catalano, R. Passariello; Rome/IT (psedati@hotmail.com) Learning Objectives: 1. To illustrate basic liver and renal vascular anatomy and its variation with multiplanar and 3D imaging using 64 detector row CT. 2. To provide an atlas of normal and variant vascular 3D anatomy. 3. To illustrate the basic principle of multiplanar and 3D imaging using 3D workstation and to explain how to optimize image quality. Background: Multi-detector CT (MDCT) is now a standard type of clinical CT scanner. Appropriate post-processing of MDCT images enables the effi cient gathering of much more information than by just evaluating thin source images. Post-processing techniques are useful both in clinical situations and for educational purposes. However, incorrect use of these techniques may hide important information. Procedure Details: 1) Major vascular anomalies that involve the systemic arterial system of the abdomen are reviewed with emphasis on key imaging fi ndings and differential diagnostic features that allow for differentiation from other abnormalities. 2) Review most important post processing technique and how to avoid important error. 3) Understand which of such anatomical variants are related with specifi c clinical symptoms, syndromes or are important for a correct surgical planning. Conclusion: Recognition of abdominal vascular anomalies on imaging is important because several such variants may be associated with specifi c clinical symptoms, syndromes and other pathologic processes. Major vascular anomalies that involve the systemic arterial systems of the abdomen are reviewed with emphasis on key imaging fi ndings and differential diagnostic features that allow for differentiation from other abnormalities. Images were acquired in a multi-phase fashion: the arterial phase using bolus tracking technique (Smart-Prep), and the venous phase after a 70 second delay, at 2.5 mm of collimation, 2.5 mm of reconstruction interval, and 6 of pitch. The active bleeding sign (AB) was detected with mean attenuation values. Images were reconstructed and rendered with MIP and MPR algorithms. Image evaluation was carried out by two experienced abdominal radiologists in a blinded-end fashion, and inter-observer agreement (Cohen-Test) was obtained. Results: Attenuation values ranged from 100 to 180 H.U. Eighteen out of 20 patients had abdominal hemorrhage, whereas the AB sign was detected in 10 out of 20 patients. It was secondary to spontaneous bleeding from an intrahepatic pseudoaneurysm (n=1), rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurym (n=1), rupture of a giant renal angiomiolypoma (n=1), bleeding from an aorto-duodenal fi stula (n=2), bleeding from gastric ulcer (n=2), and rupture of a hepatic hemangioma (n=2). Almost perfect agreement was obtained between the two readers in the detection of the AB sign (k=0.82, CI=95%). Conclusion: MDCT angiography and MPR reconstructions allowed satisfactory detection of active hemorrhage. The AB sign precisely localized the bleeding site, and therefore should be considered before therapeutic planning.",

Bonomo; Rome/IT (acina@sirm.org)Learning Objectives: Purposes of this exhibit are: to describe how to perform a color Doppler sonography (CDS) examination before the creation of AV fi stulas for hemodialysis and to show normal CDS fi ndings and complications of AV hemodialysis fi stulas. Background: Surgically created Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas and prosthetic loop grafts are common vascular accesses for hemodialysis. Although angiography has been the traditional method of imaging, CDS is now the standard technique employed before the fi stula creation and for evaluating dysfunctional hemodialysis access. Procedure Details: Anatomy and surgical techniques -(1) CDS methodology of study; (2) CDS qualitative and quantitative data necessary before the fi stula preparation; (A) Normal fi ndings after fi stula preparation; (B) Complications: feeding artery occlusion; anasthomotic stenosis; venous stenosis; venous/graft thrombosis; anasthomotic pseudoaneurisms; infections; radial steal. Conclusion: In this exhibit, we describe the role of CDS in selecting arteries and veins for the preparation of AV fi stulas for hemodialysis and the sonographic fi ndings of the more frequent complications. A detailed description of CDS examination protocol before and after the fi stula creation is reviewed. Purpose: The renal resistive index (RI) measured by Doppler US has a well known prognostic signifi cation in vascular nephropathies and an elevated RI is currently associated with the diagnosis of nephroangiosclerosis. Its value is more controversed in parenchymal nephropathies or in renal transplanted patients. Our study correlated the RI with renal intraparenchymal parameters: endarterial sclerosis (ESc) and interstitial fi brosis (IF). Methods and Materials: The RI of 81 consecutive patients were measured by Doppler US, just before renal biopsy. RI results were given as mean of 3 measurements performed at upper, lower and middle poles. The biopsy was made for the diagnosis of nephropathy (n=31) or for decline of renal function of kidney allograft (n=50). A histomorphological analysis was performed, using an automated methodology to determine the IF and ESc index. These parameters were correlated with the calculated RI for each patient (Mann-Whitney test). Other parameters were evaluated especially creatininemia (Cr) and Cockroft Glomerular fi ltration rate (CGFR). Results: For patients having a native kidney biopsy, an independent positive qualitative and quantitative correlation statistically signifi cant, could be made between RI and Cr, decline in CGFR, and ESc index. No relation was noted with the IF index. Correlations were not signifi cant for transplanted patients. Conclusion: RI is an exclusive non invasive index to diagnose the vascular sclerosis in native kidney and an elevated RI is a marker of poor prognosis renal function evolution in patients having nephropathy and chronic renal failure.",

            "text": "Helical Background: B-fl ow sonography is a relatively new sonographic technique that directly depicts blood echoes in a gray-scale presentation. This technique utilizes digitally encoded US technology and allows simultaneous imaging of blood fl ow, vessel walls and neighbouring tissues. The main imaging parameters are few (sensitivity, background control, gain control, focus number and location) and easy to use. Imaging Findings: B-fl ow sonography has several advantages over color and power Doppler sonography: The information from both tissue and blood fl ow is identifi ed in higher resolution and higher frame rates. Angle dependency, overwriting of the vessel walls by the color overlay, aliasing and perivascular color artifacts are eliminated. Major indications for B-fl ow and areas of research are as follows: evaluation of carotid artery lesions and stenoses; follow-up of carotid artery stents; evaluation of hemodialysis fi stula patency and complications; evaluation of pseudoaneurysms and guidance for therapy; lymph node characterization; and abdominal applications like the investigation of portal vein thrombosis, cavernous transformation of the portal vein and Budd-Chiari syndrome. The technique has also some limitations such as decreased sensitivity with increasing depth and inability to obtain signals from a structure located deep to a calcifi ed plaque. Also, fl ow directions are more easily recognized by color Doppler than by B-fl ow. Conclusion: B-fl ow technique provides higher resolution and higher sensitivity to fl ow without Doppler artifacts. Further improvements in the technique may overcome limitations and expand its clinical applications. Learning Objectives: 1. Give an overview of the anatomy of the jugular, subclavian and axillary veins. 2. Explain the techniques of cannulation of these veins, based upon anatomical landmarks, and correlate them with ultrasound (US)-guided approaches. Background: Central line catheterization is a clinically useful tool, performed for invasive monitoring the hemodynamic, respiratory, and fl uid status of patients, as well as for delivery of drugs and nutritive solutions. Classically, techniques based upon anatomical landmarks have been used, but that may fail if any vascular anatomic variant exists. Moreover, these techniques may cause complications as pneumothorax and hemorrhage after arterial injury. Procedure Details: After giving an overview of the anatomy of neck and shoulder, with special attention on anatomical relationships of veins, we expose the different catheterization techniques based upon anatomical landmarks. Jugular vein can be catheterized by anterior, medium or posterior approaches, and subclavian vein by infra or supraclavicular approaches. US-guided cannulation technique is correlated with each of these approaches. Finally, advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are summarized. Conclusion: Based on current literature, US can play an important role in the guidance of cannulation of central lines, as it can detect anatomical variations and venous thrombosis prior to the catheterization. Nevertheless, it may reduce complication rates and number of attempts during catheterization.",

We carried out an anatomical study of the GV and muscle, and provided hemodynamic information about the incompetent veins by demonstrating the presence of refl ux. Results: In 30% of limbs, the GV showed no refl ux and connections with superfi cial varicose veins through May's perforating veins (Re-entry veins). 14% had GV refl ux associated with superfi cial varicose veins, in 2% the refl ux was due to post-thrombosis syndrome, and in 6% the refl ux was interpreted due to primary incompetence (no superfi cial varicose veins and no evidence of deep venous thrombus). 14% presented mainly GV stasis (enlargement, slow fl ow and symptoms of pain), and 10% displayed asymptomatic dilatation. In 22%, the study was normal (no enlargement and no refl ux), and the remaining 2% showed gastrocnemius muscle atrophy with dysfunction of muscular pump. The GV mean diameters in the CVI group were larger than those of the non-CVI group (0.82 cm vs. 0.53 cm). We also measured the venous fl ow velocities and fl ow-volume after muscular systole in the different groups.

Siablis; Patras/ GR (katsanos@med.upatras.gr) Learning Objectives: To familiarise radiologists and research scientists with advanced cross-sectional and angiographic in-vivo imaging modalities for the study of experimentally induced therapeutic angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Background: Therapeutic angiogenesis (new vessel growth) and arteriogenesis (collateral vessel enlargement) constitute the frontiers of cardiovascular research in the reversal of ischemic myocardial and peripheral arterial diseases. In-vivo vascular imaging allows the quantifi cation of the angiogenic process and is necessary for the reproducible morphological and functional investigation of novel proangiogenic agents. Imaging Findings: Experimental models of hindlimb or myocardial ischemia generally involve surgical or endovascular occlusion of the femoral or coronary arteries in animals. After the endogenous angiogenic response comes at rest, exogenous proangiogenic growth factors are administered and the evolution of therapeutic angiogenesis and collateralization is followed-up. Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced cross-sectional studies with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) may depict variations in tissue vascularity and enhancement after administration of contrast media. Multiplanar reformatting along with volume-rendered CTA and/or MRA images may accurately display the morphology and bridging points of collateral vessels with diameter > 250 \u00b5m. Moreover, dynamic image acquisitions during contrast administration and corresponding perfusion studies permit the functional assessment of the newly developed collateral vessels. Finally, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography delineates the newly formed vessels with great anatomic detail. Recently developed post-processing computerised algorithms provide the capacity of segmentation, visualisation and quantifi cation of microvessels with diameters down to 50-100 \u00b5m. Conclusion: Modern applications of cross-sectional and angiographic vascular imaging with advanced post-processing and reformatting algorithms enable in-vivo morphological and functional experimental studies of therapeutic angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.",

Methods and Materials: Between March 2004 and March 2006, 7972 patients who had undergone consecutive routine abdominal multidetector row computed tomography were analysed for interruption or stenotic lesion of the IVC. Results: Prevalence of interruption (n = 8) or congenital stenosis (n = 4) of the IVC occurred in 12 (0.15%) of 7972 patients. Four patients with interruption and 4 patients with congenital stenosis of the IVC were symptomatic with DVT (n = 4), leg swelling (n = 4), leg pain (n = 2), lower extremity varices (n = 2), hepatic vein thrombosis (n = 1), and hematochezia (n = 1). All four of the asymptomatic patients were from the interruption group, and these patients had interrupted IVC with well-developed azygos/hemiazygos continuation. Eight symptomatic patients did not have a well-developed azygos/hemiazygos continuation, and drainage of lower extremity was mainly from collateral veins. Additional fi ndings in 8 symptomatic patients were abdominal venous collaterals (n = 8), venous aneurysm (n = 2), lower extremity varices (n = 2), varicocele (n = 2), and pelvic varices (n=1). Conclusion: Interruption or stenosis of the IVC are rare on routine abdominal CT examinations and may cause different clinical fi ndings depending on the variant drainage patterns or collaterals. Interrupted IVC is commonly asymptomatic if associated with well-developed azygos/hemiazygos continuation, whereas commonly symptomatic if well-developed azygos/hemiazygos continuation is not present.",
