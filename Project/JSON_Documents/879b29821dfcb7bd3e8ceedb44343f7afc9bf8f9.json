            "text": "Background: Serological testing in the COVID-19 pandemic is mainly implemented to gain sero-epidemiological data, but can also retrospectively inform about suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method: We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n \u00bc 7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n \u00bc 97 LFA \u00fe individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Results: Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titres during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titres, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 d. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.

            "text": "In the Netherlands, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 started in the Southern provinces, likely exacerbated by regional carnival celebrations following travel to and from Northern Italy during the school holidays [6, 7] . However, due to limited capacity at the time, RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was largely restricted to hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19 and symptomatic individuals with moderate disease that had a recent travel history to high-risk areas, such as Northern Italy. Even household members of RT-PCR positive individuals were advised to self-isolate but not tested. Therefore, a large number of symptomatic individuals in The Netherlands were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 up until the start of July 2020, which left many affected individuals uncertain about whether or not their symptoms were due to COVID-19. Serological testing offers a possibility to abolish this uncertainty. In an early study, it was shown that seroconversion for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially within 19 d of infection in all symptomatic COVID-19 patients analysed [8] . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of coronaviruses (CoV) is a particularly interesting target for serological testing since it is the target of neutralizing antibodies [9] [10] [11] , and serology tests based on the detection of these antibodies are being evaluated as indicators of protective immunity.",

LFA results were interpreted by trained staff and applied in the context of a two-tiered testing strategy to maximize specificity. This testing strategy combined an RBD-directed LFA with strong performance characteristics [14] with a highly specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA for confirmation in follow-up serum samples. This dual test approach is in line with the recommended common practice for serologic testing of Lyme Borreliosis, which also serves to enhance specificity [15] . Pre-screening with an LFA reduces pressure on the general health care system since it abolishes the need for venous blood collection, which is then only necessary for LFA positive individuals for confirmatory ELISA.",

Our results demonstrate the high specificity and feasibility of this testing approach even in times of strict anti-COVID-19 lock-down measures. We further described the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP and spike protein domain 1 (S1) IgG levels as well neutralizing antibodies measured using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) [16] in a subgroup of individuals that underwent diagnostic follow-up up to 20 weeks after initial infection.

The number of PCR-confirmed cases was so small since only a limited number of hospitalized patients were tests by PCR at this early stage of the pandemic in the Netherlands, and these were not yet accessible at the time of assay verification. Since the approach chosen was designed to allow for assessment of seroconversion on an individual level, our main focus when assessing assay performance was to select a (combination of) test(s) with a very high specificity to avoid false positives. Sensitivity was of a lesser importance at the time since the social implications of false-negative results are very limited, whereas individuals with a false-positive result could feel safe to visit vulnerable people, which could lead to new infections.",

Our approach had been to use a large group of sera collected in 2019 prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and we assumed that a large proportion would be sero-positive for one or several of the HCoVs. In contrast to other diseases, control sera for common HCoVs are not easily available. To demonstrate the presence of anti-HCoV antibodies in the collection of negative control sera, we employed an immunoblot that includes NCP antigens from the four common HCoVs as well as the SARS-CoV-2 NCP-antigen, the S1 antigen and the S1-RBD domain. This immunoblot was used to assay any negative control sample that was false positive in one of the tests verified (n \u00bc 17) as well as n \u00bc 9 negative control samples that were negative in all other tests. All serum samples tested were (borderline) sero-positive for at least one of the HCoVs regardless of whether or not they tested false-positive or true-negative in the SARS-VoV-2 serological assays, with the exception of a single S1 IgA false-positive sample (Supporting Figure  S1 (C)). Therefore, we conclude that these false-positive results in pre-SARS-CoV-2 serum samples are not due to HCoV cross-reactive antibodies.

Moreover, 11% of positive LFA results were tested negative by NCP ELISA (21.1% of Boson LFA \u00fe and 7.2% of BIOSYNEX LFA\u00fe; Supporting Table  S2 ). The overall lower percentages (compared to the high confirmation rates of IgG \u00fe IgM or solitary IgG \u00fe BIOSYNEX results, Figure 3 ) are partly due to the fact that an IgG ELISA was used also to confirm results with a solitary IgM band. Moreover, these results confirm that the Boson LFA is less specific than the BIOSYNEX LFA and highlight the advantage of the two-tiered strategy of combining an LFA for screening and an ELISA for confirmation of a positive result, especially when used in combination with a less specific LFA. Not surprisingly, positive results were more common in individuals that reported symptoms (18% LFA \u00fe and ELISA\u00fe; 0.9% LFA \u00fe and ELISA borderline) than in those that did not (5% LFA \u00fe and ELISA\u00fe; 0.5% LFA \u00fe and ELISA borderline).

While anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP and S1 IgG levels declined significantly over time between the first and second measurement (slope (95% confidence interval): \u00c00.53 (\u00c00.75 to \u00c00.31) for NCP; \u00c00.52 (\u00c00.73 to \u00c00.29) for S1; both p < .0001 by simple linear regression analysis), this decline was not observed for the level of antibody-mediated inhibition measured by sVNT (\u00c00.09 (\u00c00.33-0.14); p \u00bc .43; Figure 4 (B)). For further analysis, the percent change in the level of specific antibodies and antibody-mediated inhibition was calculated between the two measurement time points and an increase or decrease of 20% was considered a substantial change. When focussing on the n \u00bc 85 individuals with an interval of >6 weeks (47-93 d) between the two test time points, it was evident that anti-NCP IgG and anti-S1 IgG levels declined significantly more than the antibody-mediated inhibition of RBD-ACE2 interaction. In contrast, antibody levels measured by all three testes were stable within a shorter time interval of 2-5 weeks (19-35 d) (Figure 4(C) ). In this latter group of n \u00bc 12 individuals, 10 reported symptoms and the first serological test was carried out much later after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 102-144 d after symptom onset (median 108; IQR 105-117 d) compared to 39-103 d after symptom onset (median 63, IQR 54-69 d) in the former group. Overall, within an interval of >6 weeks there was a decline in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in 65 and 75% of the individuals tested for NCP and S1, respectively. In total, The percent change in IgG levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP and S1 antibodies as well as the level of inhibition conferred by anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-neutralizing antibodies between the two assay time points per donor are plotted against the time between first and second ELISA/sVNT for n \u00bc 97 SARS-CoV-2 sero-positive individuals regardless of presence or time of onset of reported symptoms. Data were analysed by simple linear regression. No percent change was calculated for donors whose antibody levels at time point 1 were below the cut-off (n \u00bc 5 for NCP, n \u00bc 2 for sVNT). (C) Change in anti-NCP or anti-S IgG antibodies and anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies measured by sVNT in a time interval of 5 weeks (n \u00bc 12) and >6 weeks (n \u00bc 85) between first and second ELISA/sVNT. Data were analysed by mixed-effects model analysis with Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test. \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p < .0001. (D) Proportion of individuals with declining, increasing or stable antibody levels in the group with >6 weeks (n \u00bc 85) between first and second ELISA/sVNT. No percent change was calculated for those donors whose antibody levels at time point 1 were below the cut-off (n \u00bc 4 for NCP, n \u00bc 1 for sVNT). Changes in antibody levels were calculated by as percent change (test at time point 2 compared to test at time point 1). An increase or decrease of 20% was considered a substantial change. A change of less than \u00b1 20% was considered stable (grey shaded area in C). sVNT: surrogate virus neutraliation test; NCP: nucleocapsid protein; RBD: receptor binding domain. 90% of individuals tested showed a decline in NCP and/ or S1 IgG levels (76/85), in contrast to only 31% of the individuals when assessing antibody-mediated inhibition measured by sVNT (Figure 4(D) ). The number of individuals that were scored positive at the first versus second measurement was 77/85 versus 71/85 by NCP IgG ELISA, 83/85 versus 73/85 by S1 IgG ELISA and 85/85 versus 83/ 85 by sVNT, stressing the stability of the sVNT results.",

Performance of this functional assay was further evaluated with a random selection of serum samples acquired from the mobile lab setting from n \u00bc 60 LFA negative and 206 LFA positive individuals in a side-by-side comparison with the BIOSYNEX LFA, EUROIMMUN NCP and S1 IgG ELISAs (Supporting Figure S5 ). In this analysis, 8/60 LFA negative individuals had a low positive result in the sVNT assay (level of inhibition 20-54%; median 32%). It was already known from the BIOSYNEX LFA verification that this rapid test is only $90% sensitive, as it misses 2/20 individuals with a prior RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the sVNT was able to identify all 11/11 positive control samples tested. Moreover, of the 206 BIOSYNEX LFA positive serum samples, 25 were negative and six were borderline by NCP IgG ELISA. In contrast, only 15/206 BIOSYNEX LFA positive serum samples were negative by sVNT, all but one of which were negative by NCP IgG ELISA. These data therefore show that the highly specific and sensitive sVNT assay is able to identify additional samples that contain functional anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies that are missed when using the BIOSYNEX RBD LFA for prescreening or the NCP IgG ELISA for confirmation. This confirms the lower sensitivity of those two tests, alone and in combination, which were in fact selected for their excellent specificity. Not surprisingly, inhibition levels of RBD-ACE2 interaction measured by sVNT correlated more strongly with anti-S1 IgG levels than with NCP IgG level (Supporting Figure S6 ).",

We demonstrate that this two-tiered strategy of combining an LFA for screening and an ELISA for confirmation of a positive result is perfectly feasible even when used in combination with a slightly less specific LFA, such as the Boson Xiamen rapid test, if supplies of a more specific LFA are limited. The high specificity of the BIOSYNEX LFA makes it an interesting candidate rapid test to support molecular diagnosis or help triage suspected cases when there is shortage of RT-PCR capacities to help avoid missing true cases of COVID-19 and imposing unnecessary quarantine [17] , as well as for source tracing by identifying seroconverted individuals in transmission chains that have already cleared infection and are hence not anymore RT-PCR positive.",

This has caused heated discussions about potential ethical, equitable and legal implications as well as public health ramifications due to potentially increased/encouraged risky behaviour by 'immunity passport' holders [17, 21] . One often used argument in this context is that it is not yet established whether antibodies confer protective immunity to further symptomatic infection or transmission, which amount of antibody is needed for protection or how long any such immunity lasts. In the mean-time, a wealth of data has emerged that strongly supports both the stability (as far as it can be evaluated up to now) and protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.",

Some studies have noted a contraction or even complete loss in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies levels and neutralizing antibody titres in the early convalescent phase up to 3 months after symptom onset [27] [28] [29] . However, the accumulating evidence indicates that these early antibody dynamics only reflect the typical kinetics of a primary immune response with a contraction of short-lived plasma cells. In particular, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG level described for a range of individual patients shows 'text book kinetics', with an initial peak followed by first a steep and then much more gradual decline [29] . Overall, IgM and IgA antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1 and NCP appear to contract rapidly, while circulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against these antigens remain much more stable [23, 25, 29] . Taking into account that IgA dominates the early neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 [30] and that neutralizing activity can be observed before an IgG response to S1 and RBD is detectable by ELISA, this strongly suggests that the initial decrease in neutralizing antibody activity simply reflects the natural contraction of the short-lived plasma blast response, while a much smaller population of long-lived plasma blasts is responsible for the continuous production of circulating IgG antibodies [25, 31, 32] . Much in line with this is our observation that RBD-specific responses detected by LFA convert from IgM to IgG over time, and that both anti-S1 and anti-NCP IgG levels decrease within three months after symptom onset, while the levels of antibody in follow-up samples obtained 102-144 d post symptom onset are stable. This suggests that stable antibody levels are reached within 100 d post infection. That neutralizing antibody levels showed a lesser contraction than NCP and S1 IgG levels might also be due to the affinity and avidity of anti-RBD antibodies. For very high affinity and/or avidity antibodies, a plateau of neutralizing activity may be reached, so that an initial contraction of anti-RBD antibodies is not yet translating in the same degree of decline in neutralizing capacity.",

As a result, a 2-3 year cyclic reinfection pattern for endemic HCoVs is observed [34, 37, 38] . For SARS-CoV, it was observed that 50% of former patients lost detectable circulating anti-SARS-CoV antibody responses after 3 years [39] . However, SARS-CoV neutralizing activity against was still evident in serum samples assessed by sVNT 17 years after the original infection [16] , indicating that neutralizing antibody levels against this more closely related coronavirus may be more long-lived. The longevity of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 will need to be determined by carefully designed longitudinal follow-up studies in cohorts of seroconverted individuals like ours, ideally with prospective analysis of potential re-infections. On a population level, sero-epidemiological data on neutralizing antibody levels and their longevity will be crucial to support modelling the impact of preventative measures and post-pandemic transmission dynamics [40, 41] .",

In humans, neutralizing antibodies were shown to correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 during a high attack rate fishery vessel outbreak, in which three sero-positive crewmembers were amongst the few that did not contract infection [48] . And even in the event of re-infection, symptoms are likely to be milder or even absent, as reported for the first documented case for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [49] . Consequently, passive immunization using convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also pursued as therapeutic approach to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] and antibody neutralization assays are used as a key read-out in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination trials in non-human primates and human clinical trials [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] .",

Infectious virus could not be isolated from respiratory tract samples once patients had a serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:80 measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. This may be due to the fact that infectious virions are still produced but directly neutralized by antibodies in the respiratory tract. Whether the same holds true for individuals with mild disease remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the authors suggested that both quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays should be used to monitor individuals to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions [63] .",

            "text": "While plaque reduction neutralization tests are the gold standard for assessing functional antibody activity, these assays are labour-intensive and require a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In contrast, the sVNT assay employed here is scalable to high throughput use under biosafety level 1 conditions and percentage inhibition by sVNT has shown good agreement with the plaque reduction assay and other cell-based neutralization tests [16, 64] . While future improvements may be desirable to further increase sensitivity of this assay [64] , it has hence been highlighted as an interesting alternative to quantify functional antibodies, especially in settings when cellbased assays using (pseudo) virus are not feasible [64, 65] . A recently published Australian study evaluating a range of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 reported slightly lower sensitivity values for the sVNT [66] . This was likely due to the fact that serum samples were collected at an earlier time point in the convalescent phase. Indeed, sVNT sensitivity was higher when serum samples were collected after 14 d of symptom onset. In our study, all but 2/235 of the individuals with a reported date of symptom onset that were tested by sVNT provided their serum samples at least 4 weeks after symptom onset (median 62 d, IQR 51-86 d). Ultimately, a key question to be answered in future studies is how the level of inhibition measured by sVNT at a given serum dilution compares to the level of neutralizing antibody required at which shedding of infectious virus is reduced to undetectable levels. This information will be highly valuable for the interpretation of the sVNT test outcome in regards to protection from future infection in an 'immunity passport' scenario. Since it is not yet known how long SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are stable and that this may also differ on an individual level, periodic re-testing will likely be required. In this context, it would be highly desirable to also have sVNT versions to assess neutralizing antibody activity also for arising variants with a mutated spike protein RBD [67, 68] .",

            "text": "There are some limitations to our study. First, our data do not reflect the seroconversion dynamics in the general Dutch population, since we encouraged individuals only to get tested if they had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Even amongst this group, the proportions of seroconversions we find are not representative for the whole of The Netherlands, since the majority of tests were carried out in North Brabant (the most heavily affected area in March/April 2020) and Amsterdam. Second, using a specificityfocussed two-tiered serological testing approach, we were bound to miss some seroconverted individuals. This is exacerbated over time by the fact that NCP IgG levels contract and thus an increasing proportion of individuals with a positive result by RBD-LFA that cannot be confirmed by NCP IgG ELISA. Using the sVNT in combination with the RBD-LFA for pre-screening may partially alleviate this limitation. However, seeing the high scalability of the sVNT in combination with its high specificity and sensitivity (provided samples are collected sufficiently long after symptom onset), it could also be used as a stand-alone tool. Third, as any serological screening approach, a small proportion of individuals which fail to seroconvert [24, 69] and only mount a cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 [70] will logically not be identified. Given that the degree of the antibodies seems to be related also to disease severity, this may be particularly true for individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection [27, 71] . Also, antibodies that confer neutralization via non-RBD sites may be missed [64] . Finally, while our data indicate that stable antibody levels are reached 100 d post infection, the group of individuals that was assessed >100 d post symptom onset consisted of a mere n \u00bc 12 individuals. Therefore, analysis in larger groups is needed to support this finding.",

Our data support that the highly specific LFA used in this combination approach may be useful also in other settings, for instance to support or complement molecular testing and source tracing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in transmission chains. Finally, we confirm other studies showing the stability of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, and provide the first longitudinal assessment of these antibodies using a highly scalable sVNT. This high specificity and sensitivity assay could thus be a valuable tool for serological follow-up in large cohorts to support modelling of future SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, support health authorities and provide relevant serological information to individuals.
