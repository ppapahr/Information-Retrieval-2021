International cooperation on countering the cross-border spread of infectious disease began in the second half of the nineteenth century (Harrison 2006) . Responding to the unprecedented growth of international trade triggered by colonial expansion, European leaders sought to reduce trade barriers, including quarantine, while preventing what was seen as a new vulnerability-the international spread of infectious diseases. To tackle these issues, European nations got together in a series of international sanitary conventions. These conventions led to the emergence of an international health security regime, institutionalized with the creation of the WHO in 1948 and codified with the adoption of the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951, which were renamed the International Health Regulations in 1969. This \"classical regime\" (Fidler 2005: 327) required states to notify each other of the presence of a number of specific diseases in their territories, and to implement standardized and appropriate measures to control disease entry at their borders. Cooperation thus rested on the goodwill of states to share information and implement preventive measures that did not excessively disrupt international travel and trade.",

A changing risk environment meant that the three diseases then covered by the Regulations-cholera, plague and yellow fever-no longer reflected the nature of the risks posed by infectious diseases in most countries. The discovery of new viruses, such as Ebola in 1976 and HIV in 1983 , and the resurgence of old viruses in more volatile forms reinvigorated concerns over the threat posed by infectious diseases and underscored the inadequacy of international arrangements in place to manage them. Three elements supported a shift in the conceptualization of microbial threat (McInnes 2016): (1) there are new risks, including emerging diseases, against which science and innovation alone cannot protect us; (2) globalization connects the world in unprecedented ways and facilitates the spread of viruses, reducing the significance of political borders in containing pathogens; and (3) it is possible, through global cooperation, to limit these risks by setting up global surveillance mechanisms and rapid biomedical response capacities. While elements of this argument echo those advanced in the nineteenth century under the classical regime of international disease cooperation, what distinguishes contemporary concerns from those of the past is the increased frequency with which new diseases are being identified and the increased speed with which they can spread. The result has been a shift in how we understand and deal with the microbial world at the international level, a shift often summarized by the phrase \"disease knows no borders.\"",

The report introduced the concept of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases as a new public health and security threat to the United States. It argued that an infectious disease threat anywhere posed a potential threat everywhere due to a combination of natural and human-made factors that have increased the emergence and facilitated the spread of disease. Key to countering this threat was the ability to detect disease emergence early through the establishment of effective disease surveillance systems at both national and global levels.",

Indeed, Andrew Lakoff (2017: 149) has described how the Ebola virus served \"as a paradigm for the global threat posed by 'emerging viruses'\" during this time period. The discovery of the virus in then-Zaire in 1976, recurring outbreaks in Africa, and an outbreak of Ebola amongst imported monkeys in Virginia in 1989 were central to the establishment and diffusion of this new perception of microbial threat. Recurring outbreaks of known infectious diseases and the emergence of new ones in the years that have followed, such as SARS in 2003 and the H5N1 avian influenza virus in 2005, have given further credibility to the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Davies et al. 2015) . The risk posed by pandemic influenza has been particularly emblematic in this regard. The continuous circulation of the virus and the possibility of it mutating to inflict significant economic, political and societal disruption, have led to considerable attention paid to pandemic preparedness planning nationally and internationally. The past couple of decades have thus seen the rise of health on foreign and security policy agendas and new cooperative arrangements to manage the threat of infectious disease.",

            "text": "If we live in a borderless world subject to emerging threats, then global cooperation is required to ensure collective health security. The proclamation that \"disease knows no borders\" is thus not a politically neutral statement. It is both a reaction to a changed risk environment, and the embodiment of a particular understanding of these new risks and what measures are required to address them. It advocates for a global regime relying on shared responsibilities and on an approach to epidemic preparedness and control based on a combination of surveillance, control measures, and biomedical response (Davies and Youde 2016; Kamradt-Scott 2015) . The IHR (2005) is the translation on the global scene of these political recommendations and reflects the growing understanding of infectious diseases as both a public health and security threat. Under the revised IHR, governments are accountable not only to their publics, but also to the global community. States are expected to develop a set of core public health capacities focused on detecting and containing outbreaks at source (Fidler 2005) . In addition, the revised Regulations strengthen the WHO by enabling it to draw on both official and unofficial sources of information in the evaluation of a potential disease threat. If the situation is found to meet the relevant criteria, the WHO can independently declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and issue guidelines for control measures and response (Kamradt-Scott 2015) . The new global health security regime thus allows the WHO to bypass-to a certain extent-political borders when it comes to global surveillance so that information borders do not prevent the detection of epidemics. The IHR (2005) also prohibit national authorities from taking unilateral measures in the event of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern that go against the advice of the WHO and that unnecessarily damage travel and trade. Finally, in the eventuality of a state failing to fulfill its obligations under the IHR, the IHR (2005) open the door for a collective response, enabling interventions by different global actors (the WHO and other UN agencies, states, non-governmental organizations and philanthropic foundations, for example) such as the set-up of pharmaceutical responses and biomedical countermeasures (Elbe 2014) .",

Yet, this new global health security regime is also the result of a \"power game\" between actors with varying capacities of influence (Beck 2006: 333) . It creates tensions when it comes to the understanding of security (state versus individual), the prioritization of policies in addressing microbial threat (rapid detection and containment versus prevention through a focus on the socio-economic aspects of infectious diseases), and the division of responsibilities in preventing, preparing for, and responding to epidemic events (domestic versus international).

Despite signs suggesting a direr situation, however, the WHO did not challenge these initial reports. Rather, and perhaps with the legacy of H1N1 in mind, WHO officials reportedly delayed invoking the IHR for fear of taking measures that could be interpreted as \"hostile\" (Kamradt-Scott 2016: 407). Similar to H1N1, moreover, several countries unilaterally implemented travel bans and travel restrictions despite the multiple recommendations from the WHO not to do so (WHO 2014). A study found that 23% of WHO member states prohibited foreigners who were recently in a country experiencing widespread Ebola transmission to enter their territories, and an additional 8% imposed other substantial travel restrictions (Rhymer and Speare 2016) . Tensions between national interest and collective action are thus a recurring problem in the current global health security regime and a crucial factor explaining why the lessons drawn after the H1N1 pandemic are strikingly similar to those drawn after the Ebola outbreak (Ottersen et al. 2016 ).",

However, donor bodies prioritized instead disease-specific programs, with little effect on strengthening these core capacities (Davies et al. 2015: 126) .

While these activities are dependent on the capabilities of domestic health systems, they have tended to be \"treated separately from the type of public health provision (which includes everything from the provision of potable water to public health education) that plays a vital role in the prevention of outbreaks\" (Rushton 2011: 785) . The result has been a \"decoupling\" of containment measures (for instance, detection mechanisms and rapid response capacity) from those of prevention. The predominant paradigm for global health security has thus been a state-centric one, higher-income countries securing their interests and ensuring their health security by containing diseases at their source, while limiting investments in issues prioritized by lower-and middle-income countries such as general health system strengthening to both prevent epidemics and address diseases already having a terrible impact on their populations' health (Davies 2008; Rushton 2011) . The result of this power asymmetry has been a global health security regime essentially reactive to epidemics, raising pressing questions with respect to financing and responsibility sharing for global health security going forward.",

The Ebola outbreak became a crisis in the summer of 2014 when three things occurred: (1) the virus spread outside its epicenter with the repatriation of sick health workers; (2) the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, recognizing the virus as a risk to states internationally; and (3) early containment strategies having failed, the international community began to mobilize response efforts in order to cope with the threat. This context facilitated the securitization of the Ebola crisis, i.e. its framing as a national and international security threat. Thus, on 18 September 2014, the United Nations Security Council declared the outbreak \"a threat to international peace and stability\" (UNSC 2014). Ebola's securitization created a sense of gravity and urgency, reinforcing a logic of short-term containment already privileged in the global health security regime:",

In a situation perceived as an emergency, alternative policy options, such as long-term engagement with complex socioeconomic issues and political negotiations, for instance, appear less suitable. Demand increases for a quick fix to avert the imminent danger. (Roemer-Mahler and Elbe 2016: 492) The securitization of the Ebola crisis had at least three concrete effects on the global response. First, it was instrumental in mobilizing exceptional resources to contain the virus. Altogether, the global response raised US$ 4.3 billion, an amount corresponding to the budget needed to lead prevention policies by building universal health services and maintaining them for three years in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia (Save the Children 2015: IV). Second, the securitization of Ebola allowed countries to bypass traditional protocols for humanitarian crisis management by involving the military. The United States, for instance, deployed 3000 soldiers to Liberia with the mission to implement the response directly (White House 2014), whilst other countries, such as the United Kingdom, relied on the military's extensive capacities to support their response's logistics (DFID 2014) . Third, the securitization of an issue reinforces an \"emergency modality of action\" (Collier and Lakoff 2008: 17) , privileging short-term solutions, donor-led and technology-based. Technological solutions include medical countermeasures such as experimental drugs and vaccines-a trend that Stefan Elbe has called the pharmaceuticalization of global health (Elbe 2010; Roemer-Mahler and Elbe 2016) . They include also what Peter Redfield has coined the \"standardized humanitarian tool-kit\" (such as base camps and field hospitals), comprising emergency resources that can be deployed everywhere, independently of the local context (Redfield 2008: 160-161) .",

The WHO estimated, for instance, that between 60 and 80% of the infections during the Ebola outbreak were due to funeral rituals and the washing of dead bodies, these practices constituting one of the \"factors that contributed to undetected spread of the Ebola virus and impeded rapid containment\" (WHO 2015) . Yet, because of its technological focus, the international response included few education and risk-reduction programs aimed at understanding these practices and proposing alternative solutions adapted to the local cultural context (Manguvo and Mafuvadze 2015; Richards 2016) . In coordinating the global response in Sierra Leone, the UK, for instance, dedicated only 3% of its budget to do so (DFID 2014).
