            "text": "Background: Heavy cannabis use is associated with adverse physical and mental health effects. Despite available effective treatments, the majority of heavy cannabis users does not seek professional help. Web-based interventions can provide an alternative for cannabis users who are reluctant to seek professional help. Several web-based cannabis interventions are effective in reducing cannabis use; however, the effect sizes are typically small and attrition rates are typically high. This suggests that web-based programs can be an effective cannabis use intervention for some, while others may need additional substance use treatment after completing a web-based intervention. Therefore, it is important that web-based interventions do not solely focus on reducing cannabis use, but also on improving attitudes towards substance use treatment. The Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) approach appears to be well suited for the purpose of reducing cannabis use and improving substance use treatment utilization. Based on the SBIRT approach-and based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI)-we developed the Internet-based cannabis reduction intervention ICan. Methods/design: This protocol paper presents the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which we evaluate the effectiveness of the ICan intervention compared to four online modules of educational information on cannabis in a sample of Dutch frequent cannabis users. The primary outcome measure is frequency of cannabis use. Secondary outcome measures include the quantity of cannabis used (grams), the attitudes towards seeking help and the number of participants who enter specialized treatment services for cannabis use-related problems. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, ICan is the first Internet-based intervention for cannabis users that combines screening, a brief intervention-based on CBT and MI-and referral to treatment options.",

In the Netherlands, the number of people receiving treatment for cannabis use-related problems increased from 2001 to 2010 and then stabilized until 2015 [7] .

Several studies have identified possible explanations for the low numbers of cannabis users entering treatment specifically, and for substance users in general. Commonly reported barriers for seeking treatment are the desire to solve one's own problems, the feeling that treatment is not necessary, not being ready to stop using cannabis, being unaware of treatments options, not being able to attend treatment during office hours, and stigma associated with substance use disorder treatment [9, 10] .",

The SBIRT approach was developed in the 1960s [22] . The SBIRT approach enables universal screening in a variety of settings, targeting not only those who are already dependent but also those who are not seeking help for their substance use [23] . The screening procedure typically results in three possible outcomes: no risk, moderate risk, or high risk for substance use problems. Substance users at moderate risk for substance use problems receive a brief intervention. The brief intervention usually consists of one or more sessions with a health care professional. The goal of these sessions is to raise awareness about the risks associated with the substance use and to increase motivation to reduce or stop this behavior [23] . Substance users at high risk for cannabis use problems are referred to specialized substance use treatment. The main goal of the referral to treatment is to identify an appropriate treatment program and to facilitate participation of the substance user in the program [23] . The SBIRT approach seems suitable to be computerized.",

Participants will be assessed on cannabis-related outcome measures at T0 (baseline, before randomization), T1 (6 weeks post randomization), T2 (3 months post randomization), and T3 (6 months post randomization). The trial will be conducted and reported according to the most recent version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [24] . The study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register; identifier NL7668. Ethical approval to carry out this study was obtained from an accredited medical research and ethics committee in the Netherlands (Medical Research Ethics Committees United, NL67449.100.18). The study is designed and will be performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, seventh revision. Figure 1 shows the CONSORT flow diagram of the trial. Applicants interested to participate fill out an online screening questionnaire to determine if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Applicants who are eligible to participate receive the patient information letter and the informed consent form. Participants have up to 30 days to decide if they want to participate. If they have any questions regarding the study or intervention, they can contact a member of the research team by phone, email, or face-to-face. They can also contact an independent expert whose contact details are listed in the patient information letter. Applicants who decide to participate in the study are asked for necessary personal data. After the participants have sent us their signed informed consent form digitally, they are directed to the baseline questionnaire. The electronic data capture platform Castor will be used for the randomization and allocation procedure and to conduct the online questionnaires. The research data are stored separately from the participants' personal data. Only the four authors of this study protocol will have access to the keys to join the research data tables with the personal data tables. After the participants have completed the baseline questionnaire, they will be allocated to one of two trial arms (1:1) using variable block randomization. Participants will be informed that they will be assigned to one of two programs, both focusing on cannabis moderation. Depending on the outcome of the allocation procedure, an email will be sent to the participants containing an access code to either the ICan intervention or the online control program (four online modules of educational information on cannabis).

However, the effect size of our online SBIRT program is expected to be somewhat larger due to the fact that the brief intervention is only one component of the program. The referral to treatment component may also have some effect on cannabis consumption. The referral to treatment component consists of information about specialized treatment services for substance use problems. Participants are encouraged to utilize these services. When participants enter treatment, it is likely that this will also have an effect on their cannabis consumption. Therefore, we expect an effect size of d = 0.4 or more. G*Power was used to calculate the required number of participants. The power calculation is based on 2-sidedtests, d = 0.40 corresponds with a sample size of at least 2 \u00d7 100 participants. Assuming a 25% non-response at 6 months' follow-up, we aim to include at least (100/(100-25)) \u00d7 100 \u00d7 2 = 267 participants.

In the second module, the risks associated with cannabis use are listed. Some tips on how to reduce these risks are given. In the third module, general information about cannabis use disorder is provided. The difference between physical and psychological dependence is explained. The negative social, financial, and health consequences of cannabis use disorder are described, and the DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder are presented. In the last module, some general tips on how to reduce or quit cannabis use are provided. The information used in the four online modules is based on the websites www.drugsinfo.nl and www. drugsenuitgaan.nl. The general tips on how to reduce or quit cannabis use are from an existing information brochure about cannabis use and psychosis [30] . Since the control condition consists of information that is currently available online for non-treatment seeking frequent cannabis users, we considered this to be the standard care (or treatment-as-usual). Figure 2 shows the SPIRIT diagram of the trial. The primary outcome measure is the number of cannabis use days in the past 7 days, assessed 6 months post randomization using the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) method [31] . The TLFB method is originally developed as an interview to assess self-reported alcohol consumption [31] . Growing evidence suggests that the TLFB is a psychometrically sound measure for the assessment of licit and illicit substance use [32] . Self-reports on cannabis use measured using the TLFB method show high test-retest reliability [33] . TLFB reports administered online are consistent with TLFB reports administered faceto-face [34] .",

A study initiated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration tested the effectiveness of an SBIRT program for alcohol and illicit drug use, implemented in a range of medical settings [48] . More than 450.000 patients were screened, 22.7% of them screened positive for risky alcohol use and/or illicit drug use. Depending on the severity of use and associated risk, people were recommended for a brief intervention, brief treatment, or referral to specialty treatment. At 6 months' follow up, rates of drug use were 67% lower [48] . This study suggests that brief interventions as part of SBIRT programs can significantly reduce substance use. However, a systematic review concluded that insufficient evidence exists to determine whether brief interventions as part of the SBIRT program are effective or ineffective in reducing substance use [49] . Besides, research addressing the effectiveness of the referral to treatment component is still scarce [23, 49] . In conclusion, more research regarding the effectiveness of SBIRT programs for the reduction of substance use seems needed. The SBIRT programs included in the systematic review were mainly face-to-face interventions. However, SBIRT programs seem highly suitable to be computerized.",

            "text": "Studies on computerized interventions for anxiety, depression, and problematic alcohol use show that interventions guided by a coach or therapist are more effective than unguided interventions [50] [51] [52] [53] . High attrition rates in online interventions are common, especially when there is no guidance from a coach or therapist [50] . These findings suggest that guided interventions are preferred over unguided interventions. However, unguided self-help interventions are often offered free of charge and can be used without a GP referral. This makes them easily accessible, which may be in particular important for cannabis users who are still in doubt about reducing their cannabis use. We have taken these considerations into account and decided to offer adherence focused guidance to minimize drop-out rates. The guidance is minimal to ensure that the program remains easily accessible. The present trial will improve scientific knowledge regarding the effectiveness of Internet-based SBIRT programs with adherence focused guidance for frequent cannabis users. ",
