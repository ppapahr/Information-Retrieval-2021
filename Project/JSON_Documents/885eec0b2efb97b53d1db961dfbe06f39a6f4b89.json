As a guideline, government issued directives on physical distancing and the use of face masks to curb community spread of the disease. Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19.

Patients may therefore be contagious before they develop symptoms or realize they are infected. Transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not show symptoms of the virus have been documented, and mathematical models suggest that between forty and eighty percent of initial transmission was due to transmission from presymptomatic and asymptomatic people. Available data supports the notion that the virus can spread during normal breathing, and that individuals that are seemingly well can still shed high titres of the virus for onward transmission. Kraemer et al. (2020) using real-time mobility data from Wuhan, highlighted the role of transportation in transmission of the virus across China. They identified that early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China could be explained based on the patterns of human mobility. After the implementation of lockdowns, this correlation dropped and the growth rates in infection became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. Liu & Zhang (2020) also highlight the role of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19. They used an analysis of a typical case of cluster outbreak as a result of public transportation exposure in China. One individual traveling from Chongqing, China, transmitted the COVID-19 virus to five other people in the same vehicle when he did not wear a face mask, and transmitted it to no one on a second vehicle (on the second half of the same journey) after he wore a face mask. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an epidemiological investigation and close contact tracing to screen and treat all passengers that had come in contact with the suspected case. The 14-day medical observation showed that all passengers that had come in contact with the infected individual after he wore a face mask, did not have COVID-19, while 5 of the 39 passengers that had come in contact with the individual on the first bus, had contracted the disease. Howard et al. (2020) argue that, wearing a face mask reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets as witnessed in both laboratory and clinical contexts. They state that the use of face masks could be most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high among larger populations.

Even though compliance to the policy was an individual responsibility, buses were categorized as compliant or non-compliant based on the number of commuters with face masks, on board a vehicle (Table 3) . Measuring compliance this way allowed for the aggregation of commuter compliance per bus. The survey was carried out at Tech Junction, a major bus stop on the Accra Kumasi road where passengers alight and/or get on board vehicles towards the central business district. The activities at the stop allowed for vehicles to travel at slow speeds (<20km/h) or grind to a halt. These stoppings, and as well, the fact that most vehicles had their windows open, allowed for adequate observations of in-vehicle situations. Data collected from the observations were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Table 2 shows the days and times the roadside observations were carried out and the number of observations per category. The differences in volumes could be attributed to the higher number of commuters that traveled in the morning towards the central business district, in comparison to the slightly lower traffic volumes recorded for buses in the same direction in the evening. Table 3 shows how compliance and non-compliance for both the policy on face masks and physical distancing were categorized in this study.

Government should as well bear the cost of providing free face masks to poorer communities (Tsifodze, 2020) who may be exceptionally vulnerable and perhaps unable to afford them at this time. Further, there should be additional directives given to discourage operators from allowing commuters without masks on board, and as well, the use of fines and policing to enforce these policies. Finally, government should continue to use media platforms to continually sensitize citizens on the benefits of using face masks, to encourage their voluntary use.
