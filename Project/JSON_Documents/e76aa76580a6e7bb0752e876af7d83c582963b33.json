            "text": "A key institutional metric is the staffing level of RNs. The research evidence is consistent that better-staffed hospitals achieve superior patient outcomes (McHugh et al., 2016; Shekelle, 2013). Multiple, rigorous studies have documented lower patient mortality in hospitals with better educated RNs (Aiken et al., 2014; Kutney-Lee, Sloane, & Aiken, 2013). Enlightened hospitals have been recruiting nurses with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree or encouraging their RNs who entered the profession with an Associate or Diploma degree to complete the BSN. Therefore, hospitals can best prepare for a pandemic-related surge by establishing safe staffing levels, professional environments, and high educational expectations for their RNs. Even in a well-staffed hospital with a supportive professional environment, aspects of COVID-19 disease confront health care providers with unique risks and emotional strain. Because the virus is highly contagious, health care providers face constant worry for themselves and their family members of contracting the virus. The visitor restrictions in hospitals make the health care providers the only people available to offer emotional support and comfort to all hospitalized patients during their illness and, for those who do not survive, while dying. These risks and strain present ethical dilemmas to nurses whose desire to meet their professional ethical obligations may conflict with their personal values and priorities. The ethical strain is compounded by the emotional strain. How can nursing research address this deep strain? Nursing ethics research suggests that having a positive ethical climate and institutional support for dealing with ethical issues are key elements to managing ethics stress and ethical concern",
