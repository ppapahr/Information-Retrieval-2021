In addition, older adults often have to deal with the emotional toll associated with the death of their spouse or peers. Further, the opportunities to seek help are limited due to problems related to immobility. These stressors are topped by the increase in elder abuse during the pandemic. Studies show that elder abuse has increased by ten times during this pandemic which includes physical, verbal and emotional harm; financial exploitation and neglectful behaviour with low dignity (World Health Organization, 2020).",

In addition, they are at a higher chance for illinformation and fake news as they might lack the skills required to check for authenticity of the news. This could lead to issues related to health anxiety, fear and loss of hope. They are not able to avail any of the services that is now offered online including religious/spiritual services, medical assistance, home-delivery services and virtual therapy sessions. This further affects their immunity and quality of life as they are forced to live with limited access to services and necessities. With these increased vulnerabilities, they are at a higher risk for panic and anxiety.",

Studies have shown that health risks due to isolation equate to that of smoking and obesity (Holt-Lunstad, Smith & Layton, 2010) . Social isolation and loneliness are specifically damaging in the geriatric population due their increased dependence on others. They depend on servants or other family member for their day-to-day functioning including medication, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dietary needs and housekeeping. The containment laws have adversely affected older adults as servants have stopped providing service and relatives are no longer visiting them. The irony is that, the social distancing measure introduced to ensure protection of older adults has led to a reduction in their overall quality of life and increased the likelihood of depression. In addition, some older adults might not be able to comprehend instructions regarding selfhygiene, respiratory etiquette and safe distancing leading to hostility, neglect and isolation.",
