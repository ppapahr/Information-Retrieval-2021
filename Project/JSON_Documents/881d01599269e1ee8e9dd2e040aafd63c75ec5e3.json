            "text": "Structural biology was born in the middle of the last century. It is a discipline that elucidates life phenomena by studying the structure and function of biological macromolecules. At present, there are three kinds of commonly used structural biology research methods, namely, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-EM, which together constitute the basis of highresolution structural biology research. In the past half century, X-ray crystallography has been dominant in structural biology. As of October 17, 2019, the crystal structures in the PDB database account for about 89% of the total, the NMR structures account for 8.2%, and the EM structures account for 2.5% ( Figure 2 ). X-ray crystallography is mainly applicable to proteins with molecular weight of 10~150 kDa. After decades of development and maturity, more than 140,000 protein structures have been resolved, which has become the main means to analyze the structure of biological macromolecules. NMR is often used to study proteins with molecular weight less than 80 kDa. The advantage of this method is that it can determine the structure of protein molecules in solution, and study the dynamic process and the corresponding energy change of biological samples. However, the application of NMR is limited due to the requirement of high sample concentration (usually at the mM level) and high stability. NMR structures are also at relatively low resolution.",

Of course, cryo-EM also has its own shortcomings or defects: (a) cryo-EM can only be used for a large protein complex, which generally requires a minimum of 150 kDa or even more than 300 kDa, otherwise, the protein is too small to find under the electron microscope; (b) the requirement of sample homogeneity is very high, it will be difficult to get good results if the protein is flexible; (c) the current resolution of cryo-EM is about 3 \u00c5, and is below 3 \u00c5 only in a few cases, which is still a certain gap from the demand of pharmaceutical research and development (2 \u00c5).",

            "text": "In 1931, Max Knoll, a German physicist, and his student Ernst Ruska, invented the first transmission electron microscope, and in 1933, they broke through the limit of the optical microscope for the first time, making it possible to see even smaller particles. Electron microscopy imaging needs to be performed in a high vacuum, and the radiation damage of electrons to biological samples is very large. Therefore, in the following decades, scientists could only image biological samples through heavy metal salt staining. 5 In 1968, De Rosier and Klug proposed and established the general concept and method of 3D reconstruction, and reported the 3D structure of the T4 phage tail, 2 the first electron microscope structure. In order to reduce the radiation damage caused by high-energy electrons, Taylor and Glaeser in 1974 proposed the use of cryo-EM. 6 The wheel of historical development is rolling forward! In 1981, Jacques Dubochet and his colleague Alasdair McDowall made a breakthrough in electron microscopy technology. They introduced the method of rapid freezing, 7,8 which quickly froze molecules in a single layer of vitreous state water. This solved the above two problems of high vacuum and radiation damage. The process of vitrification can not only keep the sample in its natural state, but also protects them from dehydration. 5 However, there are still many challenges to achieve atomic resolution. For example, the contrast and signalto-noise ratio in electron microscope images is low. Also one needs to transform 2D images into 3D structure. Joachim Frank and his colleague, Marin van Heel, took the lead in using computational image processing techniques [9] [10] [11] to calculate and average multiple image copies of biomacromolecules to improve the signal-tonoise ratio. After obtaining 2D images with different angles, 3D reconstruction is carried out by computer software to analyze the 3D structure of biomolecules. By 1999, the resolution of 50S large subunit of Escherichia coli ribosome had been improved to 7.5 \u00c5. 12 After about 2000, the number of electron microscope structures began to increase year by year, but the resolution was not high. However, after 2013, the number of structures analyzed by electron microscopy began to improve rapidly and the resolution also increased to near atomic level. The structure of \u03b2-galactosidase reported in 2015 had a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5. 13 Also, the resolution of the 20S proteasome 14 and the 70S-EF-Tu complex 15 were 2.8 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively ( Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "The general process of structure analysis by cryo-EM is as follows: (a) protein expression and purification: samples with high purity, homogeneity, and integrity need to be obtained, and the molecular sieve needs to show a single peak and symmetrical distribution; (b) negative staining: the sample molecules are embedded in a layer of heavy metal salt (commonly uranium acetate) solution, so that the heavy metal salt surrounds the molecules. With the yeast small subunit processome, for example, 4 \u03bcl of SSU processome at an absorbance of 0.6 mAU at 260 nm can make a sample 20 ; (c) data collection of negative staining sample (sometimes omitting this step according to the situation); (d) freezing sample: This is very important and usually includes two steps, first load the sample on the grid to form a thin water film, and then quickly freeze. In most cases, water can be made glassy by immersing the grid into liquid ethane quickly by manual operation, which has the advantage that the sample can be close to the \"natural\" state. Because biochemical reactions, especially some enzymatic reactions, take place rapidly, another method named fast mixing/spraying microfluidic chips [21] [22] [23] has been developed in order to obtain the structural information of the intermediate state of the reaction. That is, mixing the two molecular systems in milliseconds, and then freezing them quickly so that one can capture the intermediate steps in the biochemical reactions. This method can achieve time resolution of tens of milliseconds, which is very suitable for studying short-term biological events, such as ribosome recycling, translation initiation, and other processes. 23, 24 Generally speaking, the sample concentration of soluble protein is about 1 mg/ml and membrane protein is about 5 mg/ml. Take eukaryotic ribosome for example, 3 \u03bcl of 80 nM can make a sample 25 ; (e) load the sample in the cryo-EM; (f) screen sample: it is necessary to screen the sample before data collection to check whether the water in the sample is in a glassy state and whether the thickness of ice layer is appropriate. If there is a problem, the sample needs to be prepared again; (g) data collection: select good particles to take photos, and the minimum exposure technology must be used in the photography because the high-energy electrons have radiation damage to the sample; (h) three-dimensional reconstruction.",

Therefore, the development and progress of the new algorithm make people have a new understanding of sample processing: Samples are purified in computers, rather than through arduous, time-consuming, and often destructive biochemical processes. 31 6 | APPLICATIONS OF CRYO-EM",

The ribosome is a molecular machine for protein synthesis, the determination of its 3D structure is the basis for correct understanding of ribosome function. The high-resolution structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes have been resolved by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, but the high-resolution structures of eukaryotic mitochondrial ribosomes have not been resolved for a long time. The breakthrough of cryo-EM and the development of data classification algorithm provide a powerful means for the determination of mitochondrial ribosome structure and for the investigation of internal rearrangements of the translational apparatus. V. Ramakrishnan of MRC molecular biology laboratory analyzed a series of high-resolution structures of mitochondrial ribosomes by means of cryo-EM. In 2014, they reported the structures of human 44 and yeast 27 mitochondrial ribosome large subunits with resolutions of 3.4 \u00c5 and 3.2 \u00c5 respectively; they also resolved the structures of human mitochondrial ribosome 45 and yeast mitochondrial ribosome, 46 with resolutions of 3.5 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5, respectively. In addition, Ban et al. analyzed the structure of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal large subunits in 2014, with resolutions of 4.9 \u00c5 47 and 3.4 \u00c5, 48 respectively. These results provide an important structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of protein synthesis in mitochondria. The proteasome is a giant protein complex that is common in eukaryotes and archaea, and also exists in some prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, proteasome is widely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its core function is to regulate the concentration of specific proteins and to remove misfolded proteins in cells. It is one of the indispensable large-scale all enzyme supramolecular complex machines in the cell, and also the largest protein degradation machine found so far. In 2012, the low resolution cryo-EM structures of human 49 and yeast 50 26S proteasome were reported. In 2016, Huang et al. 51 and Schweitzer et al. 52 reported the atomic structure of human 26S proteasome with resolution of 3.5 \u00c5 and 3.9 \u00c5, respectively. In 2018, Dong et al. 53 determined the high-resolution (2.8~3.6 \u00c5) atomic structures of seven intermediate conformations of human 26S proteasome during the degradation of substrate by combined use of cryo-EM and machine learning technology.
