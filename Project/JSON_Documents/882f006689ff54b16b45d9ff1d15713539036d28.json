In Spain, 210,773 cases have been confirmed, of which 2750 have required admission to intensive care units in Catalonia. 1 In our hospital, 100 patients have required orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (OTI + MV), and 42% of them needed tracheotomy. Two percent have had iatrogenic tracheal rupture.",

PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. She required OTI + MV for respiratory failure, and during the procedure she incurred a tracheal lesion confirmed by computed tomography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy to be a rupture of the pars membranacea measuring approximately 2 cm. Surgical repair was performed via cervicotomy with partial upper sternotomy-transmanubrial approach-to mobilize the brachiocephalic trunk and trachea in order to access the laceration, which was repaired by simple suturing with Vicryl \u00ae 2/0 discontinuous sutures. Tracheotomy was subsequently performed at the level of the second tracheal ring, with placement of a no. 8 Portex \u00ae cannula. Progress was incidentfree and the patient was extubated 3 weeks after the intervention, with sequela of paralysis of the right vocal cord. The second case was a 53-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity (BMI: 46.7 kg/m 2 ), sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She consulted with a 4-day history of cough and fever. She did not report dyspnea, but her basal oxygen saturation was 78%. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. On March 24th, 2020, she required OTI + MV and 2 cycles of prone positioning. Progress was good and she was extubated on April 4th, 2020. Acute respiratory failure developed within a few hours and the patient was intubated with the aid of a guide. Forty-eight hours later, we decided to perform a planned surgical tracheotomy. The procedure was very difficult, complicated by 2 cardiac arrests that were resolved with resuscitation maneuvers. A rupture and false tracheal route was also observed in the left lateral aspect. An orotracheal tube was finally placed via the tracheotomy orifice, permitting adequate ventilation. After 72 h, once the patient had stabilized, we decided to review the tracheotomy and tracheal lesion. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed significant laryngeal edema. The trachea was examined via the tube placed through the tracheostomy, revealing a laceration of the left membranous-cartilaginous junction in the middle third of the trachea. The cervicotomy was enlarged with a partial sternotomy of the upper third of the trachea with a transmanubrial approach. After mobilizing the brachiocephalic trunk and releasing the trachea we could access the distal end of the laceration, which was repaired with Vicryl \u00ae 2/0 discontinuous sutures, and a no.9 Portex \u00ae tracheotomy cannula was placed. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was ruled out because of comorbidity and associated complications including 2 cardiac arrests with undetermined neurological impact. The patient progressed well with complete respiratory and neurological recovery.",

The equipment was put on and removed according to recommendations of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. 7 Both patients were obese and presented criteria for difficult intubation. In addition, the rapid respiratory function decline typical of this infection forced us to perform emergency intubation. Both factors may contribute to an increased risk of tracheal injury. 3 The use of video-assisted laryngoscope 3 is recommended to facilitate the procedure, minimize the number of intubation attempts, limit the risk of iatrogenesis, and protect personnel performing the technique (Fig. 1) .",
