Amparore et al. 1 have described Italian urology trainees experiencing similar on-call responsibilities but noted a significant reduction in exposure to outpatient visits, diagnostic procedures and surgery including endoscopic, open and minimally invasive procedures. During the pandemic the proportion of trainees who experienced severe reduction (>40%) or complete suppression (>80%) of exposure ranged from 41.1% to 81.2% for clinical activity and from 44.2% to 62.1% for surgical activity. At our institution the experience has been similar, with the vast majority of outpatient appointments converted to telephone clinics, mostly conducted by consultants. All elective operations were initially postponed unless considered high priority, such as obstructing stone disease or certain high-grade cancers. Much of the emergency operating has also been conducted by consultants rather than registrars so as to minimise time in theatre, as per guidance issued by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). This has understandably caused considerable impairment to training. Given the recent curriculum changes towards a more competencybased system, it is conceivable that the reduction in operating opportunities may result in training extensions for some trainees. However, one advantage of this new curriculum is that if a trainee has already met the required competencies, they are unlikely to be delayed in achieving their CCT despite the reduction in elective work.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 190, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Urology trainees"}, {"text": "With the large-scale changes to operative and clinical practice, one may argue that managing patients within the COVID-19 pandemic can also present new and unforeseen training opportunities; for example, the ability to learn skills in crisis management, healthcare management and leadership skills. This has potential to result in more wellrounded trainees who have developed in a range of different aspects of practice. Yet, there is no denying that many trainees would have experienced difficulty in achieving expected competencies at Annual Review of Competency Progression (ARCP). Accordingly, the Joint Committee on Surgical Training (JCST) have responded by creating a 'no fault' outcome to ARCP, known as 'Outcome 10', 2 whereby trainees who have been unable to meet training level requirements can have their training extended or be permitted to progress despite not all competencies being achieved in time. For example, for core trainees under normal circumstances achieving MRCS is a pre-requisite to gaining a place on ST3 training. Yet due to COVID-19, the MRCS part B exam has not been conducted and therefore core trainees who have gained a place on ST3 training but have been unable to achieve MRCS can still be allowed to continue to ST3 and sit the MRCS part B exam when it is next available. In this way ARCP outcomes have been adapted to account for the changes in competencies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Urology trainees"}, {"text": "For junior doctors applying to UK urology training through national selection, the face-to-face interview component of the recruitment process has been removed completely, with applicants scored solely on online self-assessment. 3 Applicants go through a series of questions online pertaining to different areas of practice including quality improvement projects, presentations, publications, courses, teaching experience, surgical logbook, prizes and leadership roles, and score themselves in each category. Therefore, as there is no face-to-face interview, be it in person or virtually, there is no formal way of assessing key components such as communication, technical operative skills, and portfolio review. There is little evidence of the validity of using solely self-assessment as a selection method and the limitations of self-assessment have been well documented. 4 Only time will tell the impact of removing the interview process from national selection. Recent studies have validated the use of alternative selection methods including MRCS pass scores, which may reduce the need for face-to-face aspects of selection in future years. 5 Core surgical trainees will undoubtedly experience difficulties in gaining exposure to emergency and elective urology over the next few months due to reduced clinical activity and the redeployment of many to staff wards occupied mostly by patients with COVID-19. With such disruption to core training programmes this gap in experience and opportunity may need to be taken into account in future ST3 national selection processes in order to ensure a fair and non-discriminatory process.

It is possible that without urology exposure, students will be less inclined to choose it as their preferred specialty, which could further adversely affect competition rates at national selection, which have been steadily declining in recent years. 7 Before the pandemic there was arguably already a relative lack of undergraduate training in urology, 8, 9 with many junior doctors feeling a lack of confidence in performing basic urological clinical skills such as catheterisation. [10] [11] [12] The current reduction in exposure to urology at medical student level may exacerbate this lack in training. Delaying recruitment and allowing students time to complete urology placements may be the best way forward.

We spend years honing clinical and technical skills in surgery to improve our patient outcomes, but often very little time is spent identifying and addressing the causes of human error.

Guidance has been issued by the General Medical Council (GMC) with regards to making these decisions, though it is near impossible to alleviate the anxiety that clinicians may experience in working outside of their normal comfort zone. 30 The GMC's statement also highlights the need for the profession to look after themselves, enabling clinicians to care for patients. 30 Many clinicians will be working longer hours and more irregular shift patterns, often in full PPE. As a result, it has never been more important to recognise the need for regular work breaks and recovery days, enabling clinicians to remain well fed, rested and hydrated to reduce the risk of medical errors. 31 It is important to appreciate the contribution of personal factors to poor decision making in such a stressful environment, which can include being hungry, angry, late or tired (HALT). 32 Remembering the mnemonic and stopping, even for a short break, when either individuals or teams experience one or more of these personal factors can make such a difference to personal performance and wellbeing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 161, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 228, "end": 230, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 269, "end": 271, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1023, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1158, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1469, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1657, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human factors"}, {"text": "Tiredness and fatigue play a significant role in poor cognitive functioning and decision making. 33 This issue was addressed in the new junior doctors' contract, 34 with stipulations made regarding the minimum number of hours off duty following on-call shifts.

RP is a conscious effort, using a structured framework, to think about an experience or an event to develop insights, and where necessary affect transitional or transformational changes using a novel paradigm. The simplest RP framework is the Driscoll model, 44 which is based on three self-aimed questions: 'What?', 'So What?' and 'Now What?'. 'What?' is a rich description of self-awareness of an experience. 'So What?' is an evaluation and analysis of the description of the experience, and 'Now What?' is the exit synthesis action plan which may generate a novel way of managing the initial experience with the intention of improving patient care. Such reflective cycles may be iterative as new information becomes available. At our institution one-third of the urology registrars were re-deployed to work in critical care, and engaging in RP has certainly been found to be beneficial in developing practice going forward. Using the 'journal entry' section on the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP) online portfolio, the registrars who were redeployed have been able to reflect on the skills and knowledge they have gained through working in a different specialty. RP has enabled them to consolidate learning and how they can apply their experience in critical care to their future practice in urology.
