Although no one can now quantify how much our surgical education will be compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe that this unprecedented circumstance will change the way we will be educated. I am optimistic that future otolaryngology residents will benefit from these changes, and I am sure that those of us training during this pandemic are deeply changed and grow in our role as physicians and future leaders.",
