            "text": "Background: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has caused a major epidemic worldwide; however, much is yet to be known about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus partly due to the scarcity of full-length SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) genomes reported. One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled, i.e., sequencing samples with low viral load often results in insufficient viral reads for analyses. Methods: We applied a novel multiplex PCR amplicon (amplicon)-based and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 from serials dilutions of a cultured isolate, and eight clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral loads. We also examined and compared the sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner.",

We found that capture was not as accurate as meta and amplicon in identifying between-sample variations, whereas amplicon method was not as accurate as the other two in investigating within-sample variations, suggesting amplicon sequencing was not suitable for studying virus-host interactions and viral transmission that heavily rely on intra-host dynamics. We illustrated that meta uncovered rich genetic information in the clinical samples besides SARS-CoV-2, providing references for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Taken all factors above and cost-effectiveness into consideration, we proposed guidance for how to choose sequencing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 under different situations.",

So far, coronaviruses have caused three major epidemics in the past two decades, posing a great challenge to global health and economy. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of viral genomes has demonstrated enormous capacity as a powerful tool to study emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika, and Ebola, in tracing the outbreak origin and drivers, tracking transmission chains, mapping the spread, and monitoring the evolution of the etiological agents [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Though by 14 March 2020, fewer than 500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were published on public databases including China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb), NCBI GenBank, and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), and much remains unknown about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One possible explanation of the paucity of published SARS-CoV-2 genomes was the challenges posed by sequencing clinical samples with low virus abundance.",

Experience from studying SARS-CoV showed that BALF from the lower respiratory tract was an ideal sample type with higher viral load [12] . However, BALF was not routinely collected from every patient, and human airway epithelial (HAE) cell culture is very labor-intensive and time-consuming, taking 4 to 6 weeks [9, 13] . Chan et al. managed to get the whole-genome sequences through metatranscriptomic sequencing with Oxford Nanopore platform supplemented by Sanger sequencing from both nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens after singleprimer amplification [14] . Holshue et al. published the whole-genome sequence using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens through Sanger and metatranscriptomic sequencing with both Illumina and MinIon [15] . To date, multiplex PCR-based or hybrid capturebased whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, as well as comparative studies between different approaches, have not been reported on peer-reviewed journals.",

            "text": "Besides inter-individual variations, dissecting intraindividual dynamics of viruses also largely promotes our understanding of virus-host interactions, viral evolution, and transmission as demonstrated for Ebola, Zika, Influenza, etc. [5, [16] [17] [18] . The analyses of intra-individual single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) and its allele frequency have also contributed to anti-viral therapy and drug resistance, e.g., to reveal highly conserved genes during the outbreak that potentially serve as ideal therapeutic targets [17, 19] . However, it is challenging to accurately detect iSNVs from clinical samples, especially when the samples are subjected to extra steps of enrichment and amplification. Therefore, we aim to comprehensively compare the sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and intra-individual (iSNV) accuracy, and other general features of different approaches by systematically utilizing ultra-highthroughput metatranscriptomic, hybrid capture-based, and amplicon-based sequencing approaches to obtain genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 from serial dilutions of a cultured isolate and directly from clinical samples. We present a reasonable sequencing strategy that fits into different scenarios and estimate the minimal amount of sequencing data for downstream SARS-CoV-2 genome analyses. Our study offers practical solutions to facilitate the studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses in the future and would promote extensive genomic sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses, which would in turn contribute to real-time virus surveillance and managing viral outbreaks. Benefiting from our experimental workflows and bioinformatic pipelines, BGI Group has launched a Global Initiative on Open-source Genomics for SARS-CoV-2 (GIOG-S, https://giogs.genomics.cn/) and makes its platforms for multiplex PCR sequencing and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing available to global research teams within GIOG-S.",

Twenty microliters of first-strand cDNA was mixed with the components of the first PCR reaction following the manufacturer's instructions. Two nanograms of human gDNA was added to each PCR reaction of the cultured isolate. A set of controls was adopted to help quantifying viral load and identify potential contamination.

            "text": "Theoretically, amplicon sequencing should be the most sensitive and economical method among the three and is particularly suitable in an outbreak where viral isolates are highly related. Although, there are still potential pitfalls, for instance, the 40-cycle PCR in our workflow might augment trace amounts of SARS-CoV-2 crosscontamination. To ensure the confidence of the datasets, we included serial dilutions of the cultured isolate and negative controls prepared from nuclease-free water and human nucleic acids since the 1st PCR. All samples in4 00 bp amplicon-based sequencing exhibited > 99.5% coverage of 1\u00d7 depth across the SARS-CoV-2 genome except for 1E+01 (95.23%), GZMU0031 (73.65%), HNA (6.17%), and water (60.24%) and > 97.00% coverage of 100\u00d7 depth across the SARS-CoV-2 genome except for GZMU0030 (94.15%), GZMU0042 (88.17%), GZMU0014 (71.66%), D7 (39.49%), GZMU0031 (0.00%), HNA (0.00%), and water (0.00%), suggesting the primers were well designed and the positive datasets were reliable (Fig. 3a) . We also set stringent and method-specific criteria to filter low-confidence sequencing reads and samples based on a set of controls (see the \"Methods\" section). Another pitfall is that amplification across the genome can hardly be unbiased, causing difficulties in complete genome assembly. Indeed, amplicon sequencing exhibited a lower level of uniformity compared with metatranscriptomic sequencing, in terms of coverage across the viral genomes from the cultural isolate and the clinical samples tested in our study (Fig. 3b , d; Additional file 2 Fig. S1 ). To our surprise, however, capture sequencing was almost as uniform as meta sequencing, demonstrating better performance than the previous capture method used to enrich ZIKV despite that SARS-CoV-2 genome is~3-fold larger than ZIKV [44] (Fig. 3b,  c) . Two reasons among others were likely to be accountable to this improvement: (1) we utilized 506 pieces of 120 ssDNA probes covering 2\u00d7 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to capture the libraries, and (2) we employed the DNBSEQ sequencing technology that features PCR-free rolling circle replication (RCR) of DNA nanoballs (DNBs) [41, 42] . The sequencing results of amplicon and capture approaches revealed dramatic increases in the ratio of SARS-CoV-2 reads out of the total reads compared with meta sequencing, suggesting the enrichment was highly efficient-5596-fold in capture method and 5710-fold in amplicon method for each sample on average (Additional file 2 Table S2 -S3). To further compare the sensitivity of different methods, we plotted the number of SARS-CoV-2 reads per million (SARS-CoV-2-RPM) of total sequencing reads against the viral concentration for each sample. Meta sequencing produced significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-RPM than the other two methods among clinical samples tested with a wide range of Ct values (Fig. 3e) . The productivity was similar between the other two methods when the input RNA of the cultured isolate contained 1E+05 genome copies per milliliter and above (Fig. 3e) . However, amplicon sequencing produced 10-to 100-fold more SARS-CoV-2 reads than capture sequencing when the input RNA concentration of the cultured isolate was 1E+04 genome copies per milliliter and lower, suggesting amplicon-based enrichment was more efficient than capture for more challenging samples (conc. \u2264 1E+04 genome copies per milliliter, or Ct \u2265 28.7) (Fig. 3e) . Meta sequencing-as expected-produced dramatically lower SARS-CoV-2-RPM Fig. 1 The general workflow of multiple sequencing approaches adopted in this study. We employed unique dual indexing (UDI) strategy and DNB-based (DNA nanoball) PCR-free MPS platform to minimize index hopping and relevant sequencing errors [41] [42] [43] . a Amplicon-based enrichment: the UDI was integrated in the 2nd PCR. Navy, multiplex PCR primers. b Metatranscriptomic library preparations: the UDI was integrated in the adaptor ligation and universal PCR steps. c Library preparations and hybrid capture-based enrichment: the UDI was integrated in the adaptor ligation and pre-capture PCR steps. Ocher, ssDNA probes. Red and green lines represent adaptor sequences; green dots represent phosphate groups than the other two methods among clinical samples tested with a wide range of Ct values, whereas amplicon and capture were generally comparable to each other (Fig. 3f) . Considering the costs for sequencing, storage, and analysis increase substantially with larger datasets, we tried to estimate how much sequencing data must be produced for each approach in order to achieve 10\u00d7 depth across 95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and the results can be found in Additional file 2 Table 3 . As a practical, cost-effective guidance for future sequencing, we also assessed the minimum sequencing output required to pass the stringent filters (\u2265 95% coverage and method-specific depth, see the \"Methods\" section) in our pipelines corresponding to different viral loads. We estimated that for high-confidence downstream analyses, amplicon sequencing requires at least 2757 to 186 megabases (Mb) for samples containing 1E+02 to 1E+06 copies of SARS-CoV-2 genome per milliliter, while capture sequencing requires 24,474 to 9 Mb for the same situation (Fig. 3g , Additional file 2 Table S4-S5) .",

We then investigated the allele frequencies of these sites across methods and found that alleles identified by capture sequencing displayed lower frequencies than the other two methods, especially for GZMU0014, GZMU0030, and GZMU0042 where the viral load was lower (Ct \u2265 29), which explained why capture sequencing neglected an SNV in our pipeline when the cutoff of SNV calling was set as 80% allele frequency (Fig. 4b) .

A similar pattern was shown for clinical samples, indicating that amplicon sequencing was unreliable of quantifying minor allele frequencies (Fig. 4d) . Plotting allele frequencies against SARS-CoV-2 concentrations supported the above finding and further revealed that amplicon sequencing was unreliable of allele frequencies at all concentrations while capture sequencing was reliable at > 1E+03 genome copies per milliliter (Additional file 2 Fig. S3 ). Referring to the iSNV identified in clinical samples by meta sequencing, we then calculated the false positive rate (FPR) of minor alleles called by amplicon and capture methods. The FPR of minor alleles identified in amplicon sequencing was 0.74%, while that in capture sequencing was 0.02%. Together, these results suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles.",

We were able to identify host nucleic acids in all of the samples, and over 95% of total reads were from the host in sputum, nasal, and throat samples (Additional file 2 Fig. S4a ). Virus contributed to less than 5% of reads in anal swab and throat swab while more than 50% of reads in nasal swab (Additional file 2 Fig. S4b ). These results suggest nasal swab could be the most ideal sample type for viral detection among the four sample types, which agrees with recent clinical evidence [45] . Previous studies have compared different sample types of other coronaviruses using qRT-PCR and found that nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat and nose swabs appear to be the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness caused by SARS-CoV infection [46] and nasal swabs are the candidate sample of choice for detecting MERS-CoV using qRT-PCR technology in apparently healthy camels [47] .",

            "text": "Sequencing low-titer viruses directly from clinical samples is challenging, especially for coronaviruses that are the largest among RNA viruses (~3-fold larger compared with ZIKV). Isolating viruses and enriching them in cell culture require high-standard laboratory settings and expertise apart from being time-consuming. The enrichment methods presented here have several advantages-to different degrees-over the other existing protocols [48, 49] . Firstly, the multiplex PCR protocol for ZIKV sequencing [48] and the Artic Network protocol for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing [49] require library preparation after PCR. Our amplicon method is more convenient since the barcoding and adaptor ligation steps are integrated into the PCR process; in other words, the PCR products are the library. Secondly, we adopt a set of controls to help us quantify viral load and identify potential contamination. During library construction for amplicon sequencing, each sample was mixed with standard lambda genomic DNA (external control), and the external control and the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are amplified at the same time. After sequencing, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is quantified based on the data from both external control and the target virus. We define a C = target viral load/(target viral load + external control load), and a C > 0.1% of negative groups (prepared from human nucleic acids and nuclease-free water) indicates severe contamination. Further, we consider a sample acceptable only when the C value of the sample is an order of magnitude higher than that of negative groups, for instance, if C < 0.01% for all negative controls and C > 0.1% for an experimental group. Finally, our work is the first that focuses around the use of BGI and MGI materials and platforms while previous protocols were mainly designed for Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Compared with direct metatranscriptomic sequencing, hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods are more sensitive but less accurate and neither of the two can be used to sequence highly diverse or recombinant viruses because the primers and probes are specific to known viral genomes. Although amplicon sequencing compromises its accuracy, it becomes the most convenient and economical method of all. Either or a combination of the approaches described here can be chosen to cope with various needs of researchers, e.g., metatranscriptomic sequencing data with insufficient coverage and depth can be pooled with hybrid capture data to generate high-quality assemblies [44] . From the perspective of virologists who conduct genomic studies of SARS-CoV-2, one dilemma is that there is hardly any standard of which sequencing method should be chosen for different samples or research purposes. Clinical specimens are precious, and it is unlikely to test each method on them. Of course, time and cost are also important factors that are needed to be considered. Therefore, in this work, we systematically examined the advantages and disadvantages of each method using different samples and proposed a guidance for rationally choosing the most suitable approach.",

            "text": "Moreover, we estimated the minimum sequencing output required for different samples using each method. This is another frequently encountered question, because larger output requires higher sequencing expenses, larger storage space, and more computing resources. The most cost-effective way is to generate the minimum amount of data needed for downstream analyses. Our work provides practical help for researchers to estimate how much data is necessary, although it varies with experimental procedures (e.g., total RNA extraction, rRNA depletion) and sample types (e.g., nasal swab typically requires less data than other sample types), and thus should be determined case by case. Some advantages and disadvantages described above might be specific to the experimental workflows and bioinformatic pipelines presented in the current work, for instance, (1) the uniformity of amplicon sequencing can be improved by reducing the amount of cycles in the 1st PCR to 13 while increasing that in the 2nd PCR to 17 or increasing the molar ratios of primers targeting the region with low coverage, e.g., genomic position 16965-17246; (2) the amplicon sequencing is particularly convenient compared with previous counterparts since the standard fragmentation and library construction steps are omitted here by integrating adaptor and barcode ligation in the 2nd PCR and sequencing the amplicons using single-end 400 nt reads; (3) using less than 506 pieces of 120 ssDNA probes in hybrid capture may attenuate the sequencing coverage while decrease the uniformity; (4) metatranscriptomic sequencing was conducted with an ultra-high-throughput sequencing platform so that the successful rate was substantially higher than usual; and (5) the minimal amount of data necessary for analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome from clinical samples across methods can be deviated from that predicted by data from the cultured isolate, and this was possibly due to the fact that nucleic acid background from the host and other microbes varies (Additional file 2  Table S4 -S5, Additional file 2 Fig. S4 ). Also, we do not consider the time spent in sequencing since the workflows can be easily adapted to various platforms including Illumina and ONT, besides DNBSEQ of MGI.",
