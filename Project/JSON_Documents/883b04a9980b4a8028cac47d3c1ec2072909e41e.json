Three months after initial of symptoms, she had frequent fevers, night sweats, myalgia, and weight loss. One month later, the patient complained of hair loss and erythematous plaques on the face, limbs, and hands ( Figure 1B-C) .

The most common clinical presentations of KFD are lymphadenopathy (79-94%), fever (35-67%), cutaneous rashes (4-32.9%), arthralgia (7-34.1%), and hepatosplenomegaly (3-14.8%). 2 Less common presentations are arthritis, weight loss, loss of appetite, hepatosplenomegaly, and sweating. 4 Our patient experienced lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats, myalgia, weight loss, and hair loss. The most frequent laboratory findings of KFD are elevated levels of ESR (78.9%), CRP (38.3%), and LDH (52.5%-81.5%). 2 Moreover, the literature has reported lymphopenia (63.8%), thrombocytopenia (5.4%-19%), and leukocytosis (2%-5%) in patients. 2, 5 Our patient had leukopenia, severe anemia, elevated LDH, raised ESR, and CRP. The most common clinical manifestations and remarkable laboratory changes along with an excisional biopsy of involved lymph node could reveal the KFD diagnosis.",
