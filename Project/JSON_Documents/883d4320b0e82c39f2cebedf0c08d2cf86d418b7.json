Nine serological assays developed by leading 40 global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioM\u00e9rieux, Euroimmun) 41 were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined 42 weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman 43 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative 44 percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. 45 Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the 46 S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The 47 best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the 48 Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A 49 moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) 50 was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total 51",

In association with the 65 evaluation of other immune responses, such as cellular immunity, the determination of 66 neutralizing antibody titer is important to evaluate the protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 67 after infection and therefore the risk of reinfection [9] [10] [11] . While the comparison of sensitivity 68 and specificity of serological tests has been increasingly studied, the association between the 69 results obtained with commercial tests and the virus neutralization test (VNT) has been 70 explored in only a few studies, and mostly among severe COVID-19 patients [12, 13] . VNT is 71 considered as the reference to assess the functional ability of antibodies to block the entry of 72 the virus into human cells [14] . However, such an assay requires living virus manipulated in a 73 biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility that needs trained staff and specific equipment, and which is 74 a tedious and time-consuming method. The first study exploring the association of 75 commercial serological assays and VNT claimed that the Wantai Total Ab assay detecting 76 total antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) had the 77 best characteristics to detect functional antibodies at different stages and severity of disease 78 [12] . The RBD, within the sub-unit S1 of the spike protein, enables the viral entry into human 79 cells by fixing to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [15] . As emphasized 80 by the authors [12] , there is an urgent need for further studies addressing the performance of 81 .

Serial two-fold dilutions (tested in duplicate) of the serum specimens in culture 114 medium were mixed at equal volume with the live SARS-CoV2 virus.

The plates were incubated at 117 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The reading was evaluated microscopically 5 to 6 days later 118 when the cytopathic effect of the virus control reached 100 TCID 50 /150 \u00b5L. Neutralization 119 was recorded if more than 50% of the cells present in the well were preserved. The 120 neutralizing titer was expressed as the inverse of the higher serum dilution that exhibited 121 neutralizing activity; a threshold of 20 was used.

The 211 low NPA and moderate concordance noticed for the Wantai Total Ab might be partially 212 explained by the excellent ability of this test to detect RBD-specific antibodies at the very 213 early phase of infection, irrespective of their neutralizing properties in line with the delay 214 required for antibody maturation [18] .

The present study does, however, have certain limitations. For instance, specificity was not 236 been extensively studied; yet the Euroimmun IgA assay seemed to have the worst specificity, 237 which is consistent with previous studies reporting a lack of specificity for this assay [5, 6, 12] . The results presented herein obtained from mild COVID-19 patients confirm that, for 245 exposure assessment, the Wantai Total Ab assay should be preferred to other commercial kits 246 due to a very high sensitivity. For evaluating protective immunity, the Wantai Total Ab assay 247 with an optimized cut-off or other tests targeting the S protein as Euroimmun, DiaSorin or 248 bioM\u00e9rieux IgG could be more useful, notably to screen serum specimens candidate for the 249 presence of neutralizing antibodies. However, these tests or others cannot substitute a VNT 250 for assessing functional antibody response; neutralizing assays remain the gold standard and 251 easy-to-use tests, such as those based on pseudoviruses [6,17,24], should be developed and 252 standardized. Furthermore, the recent development of surrogate virus neutralization tests 253 based on antibody-mediated blockage of the interaction between ACE-2 receptor and the 254 RBD is very promising as they were designed in an ELISA format enabling high-throughput 255 testing [19, 25] . 256",
