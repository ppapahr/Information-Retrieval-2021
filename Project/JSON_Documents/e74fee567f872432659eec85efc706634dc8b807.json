The present study aims to investigate the connectivity between spatial competitiveness and resilience in Europe and seeks to design an operational framework for concerted strategies of competitive and resilient regions. To assess the linkage between resilience and competitiveness, we have developed a new measure, viz. the Resilience and Competitiveness Index (RACI) as a function of two constituent sub-indices: Resilience and Competitiveness. This approach is tested on the basis of detailed data on European regions. The empirical results from 268 EU NUTS2 regions offer a solid anchor point for the proposed operational framework for concerted development strategies of competitive and resilient regions. Our research distinguishes and proposes several systematic types of concerted regional strategies according to the performance of a region measured by Resilience and Competiveness sub-indices. A key result of the study is the design of an operational constellation for strategic regional policy evaluation, with a major added value for policy-and decisionmaking purposes. The use of official data from Eurostat and of standard indicators in our research assures continuity and consistency with the official Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) classification and measurement, so that policy makers are able to compare the performance of their regions over time and to develop proper concerted strategies accordingly. The clear evidence of a connectivity between regional competitiveness and resilience may help to develop a governance approach that balances competitiveness (mainly represented by productive assets) with resilience (mainly represented by sustainability and ecological awareness) and thus to deal with the complexity in socioeconomic systems.",

The economic recession (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) has hit the complex European space -economy in different ways. Therefore, examining the determinants of resilience and vulnerabilityand its convergenceis pertinent. Cities and regionsas constituents of a dynamic spatial-economic networkface nowadays the challenges of permanent change, increased complexity and intense competition, while at the same time they have to respond to serious risks or various disruptions. Natural disasters, pandemics and economic or political crises show that cities, regions and nations are characterized by complex interdependent systems (Akhtar and Santos 2013; Burns and Slovic 2012; Caschili et al. 2015a, b; Matsziw et al. 2009; Levin et al. 1998 ). The capacity of agents in such socioeconomic systems to attract and retain productive capital and economic assets is an increasingly important concern in a global economy. Therefore, socioeconomic spatial systems, in particular at the level of regions, tend to become arenas of competitiveness, survival and resilience strategies (see inter alia Bristow 2010a , Hassink 2010 , Krugman 2003 .",

            "text": "The notion of competitiveness is related to the concept of resilience, perceived of as an effective response to an unexpected disturbance, uncertainty or insecurity. The recent increased interest in the concept of resilience originates from both a rising sense of risk (e.g. economic, political or environmental) and the awareness that open economies make places and regions more vulnerable to external shocks or perturbations. In particular, the relationship of economic disruptions and environmental shocks has intensified the perceived sense of vulnerability and, hence, has stimulated the search for new roads to resilience (Christopherson et al. 2010; Hudson 2009; Pike et al. 2010) . Resilience refers generally to the structurally balancing features of a dynamic system and its ability to resist different types of shocks, while maintaining the same functions and structure (Modica and Reggiani 2015) . Clearly, the two concepts of competitiveness and resilience, although interconnected and based on roughly similar principles, do not necessarily work in the same way. For example, actions for increasing spatial competitiveness may harm the environment and increase the vulnerability of socioeconomic systems; and vice versa, strategies for increasing resilience may decrease the competitiveness of regions. The above observations prompt several intriguing questions such as: what is the connectivity between resilience and competitiveness; how do strategies increasing competitiveness influence resilience and vice versa; and is it plausible that these two concepts work coherently in a concerted policy strategy?",

Meyer-Stamer (2008) defines regional competitiveness as the ability of a region to generate high and rising incomes while improving the livelihood of people living there. This definition is based entirely on benefits of people living in a region without considering the related strengths or weaknesses of firms localized in the region concerned or participating in the same spatial network (Annoni and Dijkstra 2019) . The definition of Dijkstra et al. (2011) integrates the perspective of both businesses and residents; it regards regional competitiveness as the ability of a region to offer an attractive and sustainable environment for both firms and residents to live and work. The generally accepted definition of regional competitiveness may be formulated as:t he capability of a region to attract and keep firms with stable or increasing market shares in an activity, while maintaining stable or increasing standards of living for those who participate in it\u00b4 (Storper 1997, p.264) .",

Besides, regional competitiveness incorporates also the ability of a region to attract skilled labour, creative and knowledge workers, investments, central and supranational government subsidies and funds (Bristow 2010b ). Firms will prosper if a region offers locational conditions better than its competitors and if welfare gains are to be expected (Thissen et al. 2013) . Economists, by tradition, argue that competition is good, as it brings out the best in firms and regions, and will ensure an efficient distribution of investments (Glaeser 2001) . One of the most intriguing questions in economic geography is of course why some regional economies are more competitive, are better able to manage to renew themselves or to lock themselves out, whereas others which are more locked in decline (Hassink 2010; Martin and Sunley 2006) .",

The fuzziness of the resilience notion generates challenges in terms of usefulness and operationalization for resilience planning, making it difficult to develop clear metrics and indicators of resilience that can be tested and monitored over time. Clearly, resilience, in an urban and regional planning context, has been defined sometimes as a goal, sometimes as a desired outcome, or sometimes as a process, making a system's outcome difficult to grasp or measure (Simon et al. 2018) . Clearly, socioeconomic systems may, in general, be subjected to various types of fluctuations, ranging from cyclical movements to external shocks. The latter type of dynamics may find its origin in both global or national-regional network forces and determinants. Such shocks may include inter alia unexpected layoffs, an economic recession, an unexpected migration influx, an ageing population, and natural or technological catastrophes of various kind. As mentioned, the ability to absorb such shocks is usually referred to as resilience (Caschili et al. 2015a, b; Martin 2012; Reggiani et al. 2002) .",

In this context, it is noteworthy that the World Economic Forum is preparing annually a Global Competitiveness Report, firstly launched in 1979, in order to classify competitiveness at a national level through mapping the factors and attributes that drive productivity, growth and human development in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The 2019 edition of this Report covers 141 economies, which account for 99% of the world's GDP. The Global Competiveness Report defines competitiveness as \"the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country\" (Schwab 2019) . Productivity is the main component in many studies on competitiveness. In a similar way, competitiveness is defined by Porter (2003, p. 22) , who emphasizes the \"productivity with which a nation utilizes its human, capital and natural resources\". The Global Competitiveness Report includes also a Global Competitiveness Index based on a variety of indicators that have shown several changes over time. Current indicators are organized into 12 pillars of competitiveness including: Institutions, Infrastructure, ICT adoption, Macroeconomic stability, Health, Skills, Product market, Labour market, Financial system, Market size, Business dynamism, and Innovation capability (for more information, see Schwab 2019). The Global Competitiveness Index offers the foundation for composing a Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI). The related indicators are grouped into 11 pillars which, in turn, are organised into three sub-indices: basic, efficiency and innovation drivers of competitiveness (Annoni and Dijkstra 2019); see Table 1 .",

The achievement of competitiveness across all these dimensions in a sustainable manner will depend inter alia upon appropriate economic, social and environmental policies, as well as an appropriate institutional set-up (Briguglio and Vella 2019). The RCI is clearly a complex, multidimensional and intertwined concept highlighting that improvement of competitiveness requires a concerted effort of many different actors. Knowledge of the RCI, its three sub-indexes and its 11 dimensions helps to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each region, with the possibility to benchmark each one to the EU average or its peers. Besides, by including numerous indicators on human capital and the quality of institutions, the RCI is meant to measure a region's long-term development potential. The RCI is a unique, comparable and transparent tool for national and local decision-makers responsible for regional development strategies (Annoni and Dijkstra 2019) which is increasingly highlighted in both academia and policy. The orientation, depth and scope of data included in the RCI appears to match our research purpose and, therefore, we will employ the RCI as a suitable operational framework for measuring regional competitiveness in the present study.",

            "text": "Similarly to competitiveness, the concept of resilience is also complicated and multi-faceted as well as quite complex for an operational assessment and measurement. Contrary to competitiveness, however, there is still not a generally accepted methodological framework on how regional resilience should be measured, what its determinants are and how it links to patterns of long-run regional growth. Consequently, its fuzziness leads to several variations in the use of the resilience concept and its analysis. A study of regional resilience may bring about important information on the key problematic issues in the region (and thus in the country) on the one hand, and its development potential on the other. In recent years, after the 2007-09 period of economic recession the notion of resilience has rapidly become a part of the conceptual and analytical object of regional-economic studies, in line with the rising importance of regions as an economic engine, to be managed in decision-making processes and public policies (Stanickova and Meleck\u00fd 2018) . The achievement of resilience after an external shock is of course influenced by a multiplicity of factors, including geographic location, the initial and prevailing social and economic situation, the level and quality of infrastructure, density of population, social capital, cultural habits, environmental conditions, institutional frameworks, and many other factors (Borsekova et al. 2018 ). In (2019) this context, a policy study by the OECD Ministerial Council (2014) has identified four main drivers of resilience, as shown in Fig. 1 . The first driver of resilience in the OECD study is economy. Resilient regions have in general diversified industries, in particular those based on knowledge and empowered by creativity, and are able to generate a great potential for innovation. The level of diversification of economic activity, and the effectiveness of their specialisation in building competitiveness and sustainable competitive advantage will usually influence the internal economic drivers. This is also important for an overall exposure to global economic value chains. It should be noted that reliable infrastructure and skills, knowledge, creativity and experience of the labour force contribute to enhancing resilience and competitive advantage (Diodato and Weterings 2015; Holm and \u00d8stergaard 2015; Martin 2012; OECD 2016) .",

The NUTS2 level corresponds to core areas as the focal point for the application of regional policies 1 and is the only regional level with available robust data required for an appropriate comparable analysis at European level. The reasoning for using NUTS2 level is availability of data for all pillars of regional competitiveness and possibility to cover the whole European Union spaceeconomy in a complex manner. Using lower regional level (e.g. NUTS3) increased the number of regions (from 268 to more than 1200) but at the same time significantly decreased the number of indicators for which we are able to reach data on the whole EU level.

Capitalist regions are all regions of the so-called \"old\" member EU states, as well as Cyprus and Malta. Post-socialist regions in our study are those which belong to EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe with a former socialist regime, including the Baltic States, as members of the former Soviet Union. Since the collapse of the state socialist systems of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s, the countries of this region have undergone a variety of transformation paths. The former European state socialist countries have all attempted to restructure their economies in the direction of market-type, competitive, democratic and capitalist societies. However, they have not all done so with the same speed or to the same degree. An initial effect of the fall of state socialism was a significant decline in economic activity (Lane 2007) . Although 30 years have passed, it is clear that the transition in many countries is not yet over. Several post-socialist countries lag in the level of infrastructure, quality of institutions, level of innovation and technological readiness. Therefore, we have used this criterion as a first nominal factor for a regional subdivision. By using this simplified classification, we are able to put more emphasis on the economic-historical substance of the regions in order to assess how the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have been transformed into capitalist systems and to investigate the substantial differences among them.",

The Resilience sub-index is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the first six RCI pillars: Institutions, Macroeconomic stability, Infrastructure, Health, Basic education and Higher education and lifelong learning. So, the Resilience sub-index is equal to the RCI Basic sub-index + the Higher education and lifelong learning pillar. The five remaining RCI pillars -Labour market efficiency, Market size, Technological readiness, Business sophistication and Innovationare used to compose the Competitiveness sub-index. The RACI index is thus an appropriate linear function of the Resilience sub-index and the Competitiveness sub-index.",

Fig. 7 In Fig. 7 , the regions from post-socialist countries are marked by red circles, while blue circles characterize regions from capitalist countries. At first sight it is clear that most of the post-socialist regions have negative values for both the Competitiveness and Resilience sub-indices. This needs to be further examined. The cross-table results (Table 9 ) present absolute and relative counts of the EU regions by their membership of the corresponding segment. The Fisher test of cross-tabulation appears to be significant (p < 0.001). So-called adjusted residuals are generally suitable for the determination of the significance source. We note again that if a residual value is larger than 2.58 (3.29) or smaller than -2.58 (\u2212 3.29), then its value is significant at level 0.01 (0.001). In our case, residuals in the group of post-socialist regions are significant in segments I a (\u2212 3.7) and I b (\u2212 4.5), although counts of post-socialist regions are significantly smaller in segment I a and in segment I b. The other significant residuals of post-socialist region counts are found in segment III a (4.5) and in segment III b (4.1). In this case, the counts of post-socialist regions are significantly larger. The conclusions of capitalist regions are of course reverse. In segments with significantly smaller (larger) counts of post-socialist regions we find significantly larger (smaller) counts of capitalist regions.",

As mentioned above, resilience refers in general to the ability of actors to develop and implement adaptation mechanisms to external perturbations that mitigate the long-run effects of such shocks and that may lead to a restoration of the original equilibrium or to the realization of a new equilibrium state (Borsekova and Nijkamp 2019) . Resilience may also be considered here as the capacity of a socioeconomic system to absorb different types of disturbances, while continuously reconstructing and retaining the same function, structure and identity (Walker et al. 2004 ). The balanced representation and implementation of effective and adaptive governance measures and action mechanisms by various stakeholders, with a multiplicity of policy interests and indicators, will be named here a concerted strategy. Such a capacity may be perceived of as a competitive advantage of complex socioeconomic systems of regions, which due to resilience are then becoming less vulnerable and thus more competitive. Our research results from 268 EU regions and Fig. 7 suggest a novel operational framework for concerted strategies for competitive and resilient regions. The next figures ( Fig. 8a and b) show the basic constellation of concerted strategies for competitive and resilient regions based on their position in four, or alternatively six, quadrants according to their performance in the Competitiveness and Resilience subindices as discussed before.",

A very interesting pattern is shown by regions in quadrant II, which are rather isolated regions or regions in quadrant IV, which are more widely represented in peripheries of the EU. If we discuss the proposed concerted strategies in the context of the New Economic Geography (NEG) paradigm, we can observe the emergence of large agglomerations mainly represented by regions is green quadrants (I a and I b). On the other hand, the New Economic Geography is sometimes said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies, because NEG focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on the intangible sources (Krugman 2011) . The choice of a proper concerted strategy depends on specific conditions of a region, the stage of its development or the level of leadership. The proposed framework for concerted strategies for competitive and resilient regions offers a guidance for tailormade and specific place-based strategies, in the line with our robust and multiple indicators.

A major advantage of the proposed operational framework is its immediate use for policyand decision-making purposes, as we used official and accessible data from Eurostat and standard indicators involved in RCI for 2019. As there is a continuity in the official RCI classification and measurement, policy-makers will be able to compare the performance of their regions over time and to design proper concerted strategies accordingly.

Therefore, regions in this quadrant may focus on strengthening the indicators of resilience while maintaining at least the current level of competitiveness indicators.Quadrant III depicts regions with both negative Competitiveness and Resilience indices. In order to set up proper measures for such regions, we may sub-divide this quadrant into two parts. Regions in quadrant IIIa should focus primarily on strengthening indicators of resilience, while those in quadrant IIIb appear to have a lower performance of competitiveness indicators.",
