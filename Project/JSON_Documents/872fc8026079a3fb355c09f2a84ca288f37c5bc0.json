We investigate immunological changes in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate 34 their potential relationships with persistent symptoms, termed long COVID. 35 We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence 36 (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days 37 convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise 38 tolerance were assessed and investigated their relationship with convalescent results. 39 We demonstrate persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ 40 and CD8+ T cells, and reduced na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells 41 remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced na\u00efve CD4+ and 42 CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced 43 exercise tolerance were common but were not associated with immunological changes. : medRxiv preprint 91 Cohort two was also predominantly healthcare workers. In cohort two, 47 had mild, 18 had 92 moderate, and 6 had severe acute COVID. All patients had lymphoid and myeloid 93 immunophenotyping and detailed clinical and health assessments performed at outpatient 94 appointment. The combined sample consists of both cohort one and cohort two. Detailed 95 characteristics of cohort one, cohort two and the combined samples are presented in Table 1 . 96 97 .

The features of acute illness are well-described, ranging from disturbance 48 in smell and mild coryzal symptoms to acute respiratory failure and the need for invasive 49 mechanical ventilation (2, 3). Age is strongly associated with disease severity, with older 50 individuals suffering poorer outcomes (4, 5). The immunological changes associated with severe 51 disease are also known, with increased inflammatory proteins, coagulopathy and changes in 52 myeloid cell populations reported (6, 7). In particular, severe COVID-19 is characterised by 53 expansion of immature myeloid populations, with loss of HLA-DR expression by monocytes and 54 loss of CD10 expression on neutrophils (8, 9) . Panlymphopenia is also prominent, with CD4+ T 55 cells particularly affected (10, 11) . 56 In contrast to the well-characterised inflammatory and immunological signature of acute disease, 57 relatively little is known about resolution of inflammatory markers and immune cell population 58 changes during the convalescent period. These gaps in current knowledge of convalescence are 59 of immediate importance, with the emergence of prolonged symptoms following resolution of 60 acute infection, termed long COVID (12). The immunological features of this syndrome are only 61 being described at present, with short-term follow up (less than one month) of non-hospitalised 62 patients showing expansion of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (13). Despite the 63 importance of this issue towards understanding the long-term consequences of COVID-19, 64 further insight into how long such changes persist, and the contribution of immune responses to",

The possible mechanisms for post-COVID fatigue and breathlessness have 69 been speculated to be associated with deconditioning, as well as hypothesised to be due to 70 persistent inflammation or immune activation (16). However, these connections remain 71 unexplored. 72 We hypothesised that, given the strong association between the immune response and severity 73 of acute COVID-19 infection, there may be persistent and chronic changes to the immune system 74 which may be linked to the long-term effects of COVID-19. Our goal was to determine if persistent 75 inflammatory and immune cell dysregulation was evident in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 76 infection. We further investigated the factors that might be associated with potential persistent 77 immune dysregulation and to interrogate the relationship between these measures and physical 78 ill-health post-COVID-19. 79 80 .

We recruited three cohorts for this study. Cohort one comprised of forty participants 84 (aged 51.4 \u00b1 16.9 years, 52.5% female) recruited for matched longitudinal blood sampling and 85 immunophenotyping at (i) time of initial COVID-19 disease and (ii) ten-week follow-up (median: Cohort three comprised of forty healthy pre-pandemic controls (aged 47.3 \u00b1 15.3 years; 55% 101 female) and was used for comparison of extended T cell immunophenotyping parameters, with 102 20 of these also having myeloid immunophenotyping performed. There were no age/sex 103 differences between controls and cohort one (t = 0.9, p = 0.35; \u03c7 2 = 2.5, p = 0.11 respectively) or 104 cohort two (t = 1.1, p = 0.27; \u03c7 2 = 0.05, p = 0.82 respectively). 105 Persistent ill-health evident at 82 days following COVID-19 106 We first investigated the prevalence of the cardinal features of long COVID in our cohort. All 107 participants were assessed for ongoing ill-health, fatigue and exercise tolerance at time of 108 convalescent immunophenotyping (median 82 days, IQR 67 -112). Most patients (71/111, 64%) 109 reported that they did not feel back to full health, while 61 (55%) met the case definition for 110 fatigue. The median fatigue score for the cohort as a whole was 15 , while the 111 median fatigue score of those who met the case definition for fatigue was 20 (IQR 17 -23) (Table   112 1). Two-thirds of participants (76/111; 68.4%) underwent a six-minute-walk test (6MWT). The 113 median distance covered was 475m . The median maximal Modified Borg 114 Dyspnoea Scale (MBS) score reported was 3 (IQR 2 -5). The median distance covered by 115 convalescent individuals was lower than that seen in healthy populations, but higher than that 116 reported in post-ARDS patients (17, 18) . These findings demonstrate that the primary features of 117 long COVID are common in our convalescent cohort who attended for follow up appointment. 118 We therefore wanted to further investigate if there were further physiological changes, 119 particularly in relation to immunity, in COVID convalescence. 120 .

As expected, acute SARS-CoV-2 164 infection was associated with striking lymphopenia (Figure 3B ). We found a significant reduction 165 in the total number of immune (CD45+) cells, total lymphocytes (CD3+), CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T 166 cells in comparison to healthy controls (n=40). Despite this significant lymphopenia during acute 167 COVID-19 infection, at ten weeks post-COVID all of these counts had significantly recovered and 168 were similar to those of control participants (Figures 3A-3D) . 169 On more detailed T cell immunophenotyping, we found that acute infection was associated with 170 a significant reduction in absolute na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and increased activated 171 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in comparison to controls. Over the course of ten weeks, whilst 172 na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts had partially recovered, they remained significantly lower than 173 the levels of healthy controls (Figures 3E, 3F) . Numbers of effector CD8+ T cells remained 174 expanded over the course of COVID-19 recovery and counts were significantly greater than 175 healthy controls at ten-week follow-up ( Figure 3G ). One of the most notable differences was that 176 activated T cell numbers did not significantly change with resolution of illness; there were 177 significantly higher numbers of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients ten weeks post-COVID 178 compared to healthy controls (Figures 3H, 3I) . Interestingly, there was no association between 179 convalescent lymphocyte subset counts and severity of initial infection (na\u00efve CD4+ T cells 180 \u03c7 2 =0.31, p=0.86, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells \u03c7 2 =4.12, p=0.13, effector CD8+ T cells \u03c7 2 =0.29, p=0.19, 181 activated CD4+ T cells \u03c7 2 =0.28, p=0.87, activated CD8+ T cells \u03c7 2 =0.29, p=0.07).",

It is a single-centre study at a single medium-term 377 interval. However, we have two separate convalescent time points, in addition to data from acute 378 illness. This allows a disease and recovery trajectory to be plotted. We have loss to follow-up, 379 with 31% of patients attending their outpatient appointments. This is a common challenge seen 380 in research conducted in clinical ambulatory care settings. However, our cohort may have an 381 increased burden of symptoms following COVID-19 than that seen in the entire affected 382 population. 383 The results reported here provide insights into the immune consequences of SARS-CoV-2 384 infection, as well as the age effects on immune recovery.

Encouragingly, 389 our matched longitudinal patient data shows that all cell counts return towards levels of healthy 390 controls. Although there are persistent lymphocyte and monocyte abnormalities at 68 days, 391 these had resolved by 101 days post infection with the exception of a persistent expansion of 392 activated CD8+ T cells. We show that age, while being strongly associated with poor outcome in 393 acute COVID, is also strongly associated with impaired immunological recovery in convalescence. 394 The association of D-dimer levels with activated lymphocytes provide a potential basis for 395 persistent immune dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While we demonstrate the 396 burden of persistent ill-health following SARS-CoV-2 infection, this was not associated with 397 immunological changes. 398 399 .

            "text": "305infection. Further analysis of COVID convalescence found that the expansion of activated CD8+ T 306 lymphocytes is still evident at a median of 101 days following infection. Equally notable is the 307 recovery post-COVID of myeloid populations to levels similar to healthy controls. While we report 308 persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes at 68 days, all monocyte populations have 309 normalized at 101 days. Given that the myeloid compartment is significantly altered in acute310    infection, it is reassuring to see resolution of these changes at convalescence. Similarly, routine 311 clinical measures of inflammation and coagulation also return to normal levels. The exception to 312 this is D-dimers, which remain elevated in 18% of patients. Persistent ill-health is common in our 313 cohort, with almost two-thirds (64%) not feeling back to full health, and fatigue seen in more 314 than half the cohort. These are the cardinal features described in long COVID. However, these 315 findings of persistent ill-health are independent of immunological parameters measured.316    While persistent expansion of activated T lymphocytes are described in the setting of chronic 317 viral infection, they are less commonly seen following infection by an acute pathogen (19).318    However, persistent activation of CD8+ T cells has been reported in the setting of parvovirus B19 319 infection, as well as the aftermath of severe influenza A H7N9 infection(20, 21). Interestingly, we 320 demonstrate that D-dimer levels are closely associated with both activated CD4 and ). We now report that the elevations in D-dimers is associated with increased levels of 323 activated T lymphocytes and reduced levels of na\u00efve T lymphocytes. Potential mechanisms for 324 this include persistent endothelial dysfunction following resolution of infection, as well as the 325 degradation of extra-vascular sites of coagulation (23, 24). D-dimers have also been shown to be 326 markers of crosstalk between the coagulation system and adaptive immune system in chronic 327 viral infection such as HIV(25). The data we present here highlight the need for further328    investigations of such crosstalk in the context of COVID-19.329    One of the most striking findings was that these T cell-specific changes are most marked in older330 >60-year-old participants, with persistent abnormalities across na\u00efve and activated CD4+ and 331 CD8+ T cells, while those aged <40 show complete resolution of these changes. While age is 332 known to affect immune recovery in treated chronic infections such as HIV, there is relatively 333 little known about ageing and immune recovery following acute viral infections (26). The ageing 334 immune system has been implicated in the ageing-associated mortality rate in acute COVID-19 335 (27). T cell responses are crucial in modulating the immune response and preventing host damage 336 in acute viral infections such as influenza (28). Impairment of the adaptive immune system with 337 age, in particular immunosenescence, has been well-described (29). This is of particular 338 importance when considering the impact of lasting immunity in previously infected older 339 individuals and how little is known about adaptive immune responses in this population in the 340 context of COVID-19. The ability to sustain an effective memory immune response to infection 341 has been shown to diminish with age (30). A recent study found there was a general decline in 342 recognition of viral-associated peptides between the ages of 42 and 58 in a pre-shown to be highly variable (32, 33). These results emphasize the importance of 346 further study into activation and resolution of immune responses in SARS-CoVwe found the cardinal features of long COVID, namely the presence of fatigue and 349 reduced exercise tolerance, had no association with lymphocyte subset changes. Nonetheless, 350 we demonstrate a large burden of fatigue, breathlessness, and ill-health in this cohort. This is 351 reflective of previous clinical descriptors of long COIVD cohorts. Our group have previously 352 reported a high prevalence of post-COVID fatigue, which was independent of severity of initial 353 infection (34). These findings have been replicated in subsequent studies showing persistent ill-354 health in young, otherwise healthy individuals (35). Our findings further highlight the difficulty in 355 establishing a reliable biomarker for ongoing ill-health following COVID-19 infection. 356 While it is likely that the proportion of those reporting persistent ill-health is likely confounded 357 by their increased likelihood to attend for follow-up, it demonstrates a significant burden of 358 morbidity. It will be illuminating to follow the prevalence of autoimmune disease in the general 359 population in the post-pandemic era. This is particularly relevant given the concept of bystander 360 T cell activation during viral infection. Bystander T cell recruitment has been described in both 361 hepatitis A and influenza A infection (36, 37). While the activation of such T cells are considered 362 beneficial in the control of acute infection and protective immunity, such non-specific immune 363 activation has been associated with immunopathology, or host damage (38). Indeed, activation 364 of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in acute infection has been associated with in children (MIS-C), a new paediatric inflammatory condition associated 368 with COVID-19 (41). Autoantibodies against multiple cell types have been demonstrated in this 369 condition, while immune complex formation has also been implicated (42, 43). Furthermore, this 370 is similar to the immunopathology seen in other post-infectious autoimmune conditions, such as 371 Kawasaki disease (44). Pro-thrombotic autoantibody generation has also been described in acute 372 COVID-19 in adult populations, which would link both activated T lymphocytes and elevated D-373 dimers (45). D-dimer levels have also been reported to correlate with CD8+ lymphocytes in MIS-374 C (46). Further characterisation of these persistently activated cells is warranted to inform 375 assessment of their functional consequences.376",
