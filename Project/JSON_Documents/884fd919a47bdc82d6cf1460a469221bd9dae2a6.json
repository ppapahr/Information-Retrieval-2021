In addition, impact of disruptions in information services on the schedule execution in the physical structure is analyzed.

The operations control model (M1) is first used to assign and sequence ISs to operations in material flows, and then a flow control model (M2) is employed to assign and schedule jobs at IRs subject to the requirements on the ISs availability. The basic interaction of these two models is that after the solving M1, the found control variables are used in the constraints of M2.

An analysis of constraints in M1 and M2 shows that both state and control variables are constrained (i.e., the mixed state-control constraints exist Boltyanskiy 1973) and form therefore a dynamic system with a variable control domain. To obtain necessary conditions of control optimality, Boltyansky's method of local sections can be used.
