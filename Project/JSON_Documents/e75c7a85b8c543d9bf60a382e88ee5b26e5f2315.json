            "text": "We suspect that in many cases the primary mechanism by which COVID-19 causes respiratory failure is pulmonary endothelial dysfunction with diffuse, heterogeneously distributed pulmonary microthrombi in some lung regions, and significant pulmonary vascular dilatation in other lung regions. These simultaneous abnormalities could explain the combined dead-space and shunt physiology, as well as the preserved pulmonary hemodynamics and normal right ventricular function reported previously. 3 The coexistence of obliterative lesions and vasodilatory regions is reminiscent of the pathophysiology seen in cirrhotic patients with portopulmonary hypertension (obliterative) and hepatopulmonary syndrome (vasodilatory). 4 The improvement in oxygenation noted with increased PEEP in COVID-19 \"ARDS\" may be attributable to decreased cardiac output, leading to decreased shunt fraction rather than to alveolar recruitment. 1 Autopsy studies from the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s, caused by SARS-CoV-1 virus, have demonstrated pulmonary thrombi, pulmonary infarcts, and microthrombi in other organs. [5] [6] [7] [8] It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is causing similar pathophysiological derangements. Although microthrombi are present in sepsis and classic forms of ARDS, they are unlikely to be the principal cause of respiratory failure and organ dysfunction. 9, 10 In COVID-19 pneumonia, the thrombi may play a direct and significant role in gas exchange abnormalities and in multisystem organ dysfunction. The preserved lung compliance noted early in the course of COVID-19 patients with bilateral airspace opacities suggests that the observed pulmonary infiltrates could represent areas of pulmonary infarct and hemorrhage. In our series, disseminated intravascular coagulation was not the cause of microthrombi as all four patients had normal platelet, PT, PTT, and fibrinogen levels without demonstration of hemolysis, despite elevated D-dimer levels. The high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia may point to an underlying susceptibility to endothelial injury and dysregulation in this metabolic syndrome.",
