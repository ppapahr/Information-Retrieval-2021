We conducted a survey on age-specific social contact patterns to assess effects of physical distancing measures and used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to simulate the epidemic. Because multiple distancing measures were implemented simultaneously, we assessed their overall effects and the contribution of each measure. Before measures were implemented, the estimated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) was 2.38 (95% CI 2.01-2.80). During lockdown, daily contacts decreased by 86.9% and R 0 decreased by 81.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 71.8%-86.0%); each distancing measure decreased R 0 by 10%-24%. By April 26, the attack rate in Greece was 0.12% (95% CrI 0.06%-0.26%), one of the lowest in Europe, and the infection fatality ratio was 1.12% (95% CrI 0.55%-2.31%).

If the other 2 parameters did not change before and during social distancing measures, the relative reduction, \u03b4, in R 0 is equivalent to the reduction in the dominant eigenvalue of the contact matrices obtained for the 2 periods (Appendix) (14, 16) . To account for a lower susceptibility for children than for adults, we introduced an age-dependent proportionality factor, s i , measuring susceptibility to infection of persons in age group i, as in other studies (13, 17) . We performed the analysis using a conservative estimate for s i , and considered the susceptibility among persons 0-17 years of age to be 0.34 compared with persons >18 years of age (Appendix Table 2 ) (13) .",

For example, many countries, including Greece, instituted large-scale or national school closures (34) . We estimated that each measure alone could reduce an R 0 of \u22481.1-1.3 to <1.0. Only multiple social distancing measures would be effective for reducing an R 0 at the initial level (2.38) observed in Greece. The finding concerning an 18.5% reduction in R 0 related to school closures agrees with recent studies suggesting that this measure likely is much less effective for COVID-19 than for influenza-like infections (17, 28) . Concerning the course of the epidemic after lockdown, moderately relaxing social distancing could be safe if ongoing infection control strategies are adopted; milder social distancing measures would demand stricter infection control policies.",

The number of infectious cases subsided considerably towards the end of April; however, even during this period with low transmission levels, 2 local outbreaks were identified, 1 in a refugee camp and 1 in a private healthcare unit, thus increasing the number of diagnosed cases in the respective days (Figure 1 ).

Recall bias might be observed, although to what direction is not clear. A general limitation in contact diaries is that participants record a fraction of their contacts (42) . However, biases in participant recall are difficult to quantify, especially for those with many contacts in different settings. For example, short-lived contacts and work contacts are more likely to be underreported (42) . Thus, recall bias could be different among children and adults and in various settings. In addition, underreporting might have occurred before and during lockdown because of many social contacts before the pandemic or because participants were afraid to disclose contacts during lockdown. Second, the survey was conducted in a sample from the Athens metropolitan area and not from the whole country. However, no consistent relationship has been found between social contacts and urbanization (43) . In addition, most (79%) of the population of Greece lives in urban areas, and Athens accounts for 35% of the population. Furthermore, the observed reduction of social contacts during lockdown was similar to other surveys (13, 14) . Third, estimated R 0 depends on the serial interval. Because no data from a local study of Figure 6 . Estimated R t after the partial lifting of social distancing measures at the end of the first coronavirus disease epidemic wave in Greece for varying effectiveness levels of infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks, maintaining social distances, in reducing susceptibility to infection. R t during lockdown was 0.46. For the partial lifting of measures, we hypothesized a scenario in which contacts at work and school contacts will return to 50% lower than pre-epidemic levels and leisure activities will return to 60% lower than pre-epidemic levels.

Cereda et al., unpub. data, https://arxiv. org/abs/2003.09320). The estimated R 0 aligned with estimates obtained in China (44) and Italy (45) , and we accounted for the uncertainty in this value. We also repeated the analysis assuming a shorter serial interval (12) , which resulted in a lower reproduction number. Fourth, in assessing the effect of each social distancing measure separately, we should note that an interrelation exists between the different measures and our approach might be an approximation. For example, school closure alone might result in increases in leisure contacts or decline in work contacts because parents need to be home with younger children. Fifth, as elsewhere, we assumed that changes in social contacts occur as soon as interventions take place, rather than gradually during lockdown dates (28) , which could be valid for some interventions, such as school closure, but not for others. Finally, we did not consider case-based interventions that might have affected contacts, such as isolation of confirmed cases and quarantine of close contacts. In Greece, narrow testing criteria were applied beginning March 16 and elderly or severely ill persons, other high-risk groups, and healthcare personnel were tested but others were not; also, the testing capacity during March and April was low.",

            "text": "Overall, the social distancing measures Greece put in place in early March 2020 had a substantial impact on contact patterns and reduced R 0 to <1.0. By the end of April, the spread of COVID-19 was contained in Greece, and the country had one of the lowest ARs in Europe after the first pandemic wave. However, as social distancing and travel restrictions are relaxed, close monitoring of R t is essential in order to adapt interventions over time without having to resort to stringent measures. Measuring social mixing patterns and adherence to infection control measures through repeated surveys can be additional tools for real-time monitoring of the epidemic potential in the months to come.
