It is essential that medical services be equipped for effective teleconsultation and that teams should be regularly trained so as to enable rapid and efficient implementation [9] . ENT telemedicine could also contribute to management of Covid-19-positive patients: sudden-onset anosmia accounted for only 2% of the present patients but is one of the first clinical signs of Covid-19 [16] , and teleconsultation enabled adapted management. For patients without suspected Covid-19, especially in at-risk populations (elderly, diabetic, etc.), teleconsultation allows follow-up of chronic pathology [17] without risk of contamination due to travel and can avoid loss of chance due to delayed diagnosis or treatment, reduce stress and facilitate resumption of activity when lockdown is relaxed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 599, "end": 602, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 807, "end": 811, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1024, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several previous studies of telemedicine reported good overall satisfaction, as access to specialist opinion is facilitated and time is saved by avoiding the need to travel [4] [5] [6] .
