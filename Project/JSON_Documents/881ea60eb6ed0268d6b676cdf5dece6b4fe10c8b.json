Efforts to develop a vaccine initially failed in the 1960s when the first vaccine candidate, a formalin-inactivated vaccine, did not protect against RSV in children but instead induced exacerbated lung disease after subsequent RSV exposure requiring hospitalization and causing death [3, 4] . The potential risk of enhanced disease has hampered vaccine development such that, even after more than 50 years of effort, no vaccine is available yet. An alternative approach for prevention of RSV disease is passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). RSV-IGIV (RespiGam), an intravenous immunoglobulin containing high titers of RSV neutralizing antibodies, was initially approved in 1995 as a passive immunization strategy but was discontinued in 2003 after its replacement by the more potent mAb palivizumab (humanised mAb that targets the RSV fusion (F) protein) [5] . Palivizumab is the only currently approved prophylaxis and its use is limited to high-risk infants (premature, heart and lung disease, Down syndrome) in high-income countries [3] . These data demonstrate that neutralizing Abs are efficient in preventing RSV disease and that antibody levels correlate with RSV disease prevention. The development of suptavumab (REGN2222), another mAb targeting the RSV F protein as a preventive strategy for use in preterm infants was discontinued in 2017 as it failed to meet the primary endpoint of preventing medically-attended RSV infections [6, 7] . A promising mAb candidate currently in clinical development is nirsevimab (MEDI8897), which targets the prefusion form of RSV F protein [8] . With a higher potency and extended half-life as compared to palivizumab, nirsevimab holds promise for protecting from RSV-associated lower respiratory disease for all infants entering their first RSV season and highrisk infants entering their first and second RSV seasons [7, 8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 414, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 415, "end": 417, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1003, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1184, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1588, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1591, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1733, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2011, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2014, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Future clinical use of therapeutics, vaccines and mAbs to prevent RSV raises concerns about the emergence of local resistant strains [9, 10] .

RSV strains that are resistant to palivizumab were found to be rare [10] . The frequency of natural resistance-associated polymorphisms for nirsevimab was also low (in vitro < 1%). However, the degree to which the acquisition of resistance will impact the effectiveness of current and future RSV therapeutics on a global scale remains unclear. To date, mAb-resistant mutants (MARMs) have not been thoroughly studied worldwide and little is known about the prevalence of naturally occurring resistant RSV strains either.

The sample size will result in precise frequency estimates of RSV A and B subtypes as well as polymorphisms. The width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) will be no larger than 4%. In extremely low or high prevalence (e.g. < 7.5% or > 92.5%) the width of the 95% CI will be less than 2%. This study is also well powered to detect differences in the prevalence of subtypes (RSV A vs B). An estimate of the mean prevalence of RSV A (two-thirds) was derived from the study by Zhu et al.

The INFORM RSV study has at least 90% power to detect a difference in the prevalence of subtypes between groups of 7% at an alpha of 0.05 (e.g. 70% RSV A in males vs. 63% RSV A in females), and at least 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.08 using a 4 degrees of freedom chi-square test. This means, for example, that this study can detect a difference in the distribution of RSV subtypes if the prevalence of RSV A across the sites were approximately as follows: 58, 62, 66, 70, and 74%. These sample size calculations were conducted in PASS software, using the two-sided CIs for single proportions with the simple asymptotic method with continuity correction and a chi-square test power analysis.

The main purpose of the project is to secure RSV samples to monitor RSV strains for changes in key epitopes recognized by mAbs. RSV is a member of the human orthopneumoviridae family [15] , which are RNA viruses and therefore prone to genomic mutations. The possibility of immunological escape or viral resistance from mAbs approved or under development is a potential concern. In fact, a previous study performed by Regeneron (NCT02325791) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of suptavumab for the prevention of medically attended RSV infection in preterm infants failed to meet its predefined efficacy endpoint based on its reduced efficacy against RSV B strains [16] . The reduced RSV B efficacy was due to a twoamino acid change at positions 172 and 173 in the antigenic site V region of the F protein, the epitope of suptavumab, which reduced susceptibility to suptavumab neutralization in vitro.
