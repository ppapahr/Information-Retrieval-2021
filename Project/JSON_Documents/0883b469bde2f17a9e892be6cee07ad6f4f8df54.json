However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities, and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draws attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.",

According to the available data, Italy had among the highest number of contagions and dead toll from COVID-19, with over 200,000 confirmed cases and more that 30,000 deceased as of May 14 th 2020. However, the spread of COVID-19 has been quite heterogeneous in speed, reach, and lethality, not only from country to country, but also in different regions of the same country. The main possible explanation is given by the delay between the onset of the epidemic, the first diagnosis, and the kick-off of containment measures. Other reasons may be due to region-specific variables, such as population density and mean age, societal structure, and behaviors. A third factor depends also on the adopted policies for containment and testing, in particular for what concerns the fraction of infectious individuals that never display symptoms (asymptomatic).",

Earlier work on the topic showed that efficient outbreak control may require tracing and isolation of up to 80% of the contacts, and with very short delay from onset to isolation 4 . This is hardly feasible on a large scale using only traditional methods for contact tracing, and managing the epidemics in the long term will likely require the use of information technology to help implement measures of containment and mitigation. In particular, precise identification of cases and contact tracing and isolation can hardly be performed with traditional methods, and the use of targeted phone apps could highly improve the efficiency of these processes, as shown by the experience of multiple Asian countriessuch as South Korea.",

The simulations show that suppression can be achieved in most regions even with only 25% of the population using the app (dashed lines), but the epidemics does not die out, being almost entirely sustained by the districts with the highest population density (Milan, Monza, Neaples; Fig. 5 ). This result is, clearly, achieved by using the app to augment an efficient tracking and isolation of new symptomatic cases, and indicates that, as for all interventions, effectiveness of appmediated contact-tracing and voluntary quarantine should be evaluated in the light of region-specific differences. a b Fig. 1 Density and mobility influence contact tracing app effectiveness.

Our model allows to directly simulate such scenarios while at the same time keeping track of the trends in isolated and quarantined cases.

Our first choice estimate for contact rate came from the experience of the Diamond Princess, based on which we estimated it at a very impressive figure of 14.8, a condition that would hardly allow for suppression in a nation-wide context. However, it is evident that the situation in a closed environment favors a higher contact rate, thus this number is likely to be significantly overestimated.

The model can be further improved and expanded by adding age-specific compartments, sex and gender factors, and risk classes, by refining the implementation of vital dynamics, and by modeling different methods for contact tracing with varying degree of compliance.
