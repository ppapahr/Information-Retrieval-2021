            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that outbroke first in the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has reached a global pandemic dimension as declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 , globally affecting about 3 million people as of April 27 this year [1] [2] [3] . This respiratory disease is caused by a novel RNA coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterized by rapid and efficient human-to-human transmission in the population that is devoid of preexisting immunity and left without efficacious treatments or vaccines. Given the COVID-19 coronavirus emergency, a special focus is needed on the impact of this rapidly spreading viral infection on cancer patients. Patients with cancer are more vulnerable to infections than other individuals because malignancy and anticancer therapy result in an immunosuppressive status and more likely to have higher morbidity and mortality than the general population 3 . For example, patients with lung cancer usually have compromised lung function with associated dyspnea, cough, and polypnea. They might be at higher risk of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to decreased pulmonary function 3 . In the small case series of 18 Chinese patients considered, those with cancer were older and more likely to have a history of smoking than patients without cancer. However, no significant differences in sex, other baseline symptoms, and other comorbidities were found except older age, which was the only risk factor for severe events 2 . An Italian study assessing the case fatality of COVID-19 found that among 355 patients who died and underwent detailed chart review, 72 (20.3%) had active cancer 4 . Some recent evidences suggest that gender 5 , smoke 5 , physical exercise 6 , previous vaccinations 7 , blood type 8 , human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants 9 , and alterations in the genes involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 like the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), can affect individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 . SARS-CoV cell entry relies on the binding of the spike protein S1 to ACE2 receptor 11-13 and on protein priming by host's serine protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2 0 site leading to the fusion of the viral envelope with cell membranes by the S2 subunit 14 . Analysis of the receptor-binding motif, a portion of the receptor-binding domain that takes contact with ACE2 12, 15, 16 , revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding by SARS-CoV S were conserved in SARS-CoV-2 S. In contrast, most of these residues were absent from S proteins of SARS-CoV previously found not to use ACE2 for entry [17] [18] [19] . Among the many mysteries about COVID-19, one is why it hits some people harder than others. In recent weeks, researchers have begun asking whether genetics could influence the severity of symptoms. In this context, oncologic patients require even more attention. Recently, COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium, a collaborative effort aimed to learn more about the impact of the new coronavirus on people affected by hematologic and solid malignancies, has been launched. In order to protect cancer patients against COVID-19 infection, some treatments can be envisioned (Fig. 1) . Active vaccination is the gold standard but anti-COVID-19 vaccines efficacy is still under investigation. Passive vaccination can be elicited by hyperimmune plasma or by neutralizing antibodies administration thereby hindering SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2. ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 interaction can be altered also by targeting the process of protein terminal glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum for both ACE2 and the spike protein in infected cells (i.e., by hydroxychloroquine and/or by ammonium chloride [NH 4 Cl]) 20, 21 . Moreover, TMPRSS2 can be targeted both by drugs that inhibit its enzymatic activity (i.e., camostat mesilate) or by treatments that inhibit its expression (i.e., antiandrogen therapies) 22 (Fig. 1) .",

In the TCGA portal, we selected PanCancer Atlas studies, including 35 cancer types. In this dataset, we focused on the expression data of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 10,953 oncologic patients. From the GTEx portal, we analyzed the expression of 22,951 tissue samples from 980 healthy donors and related clinical data available. Gene expression data were downloaded as transcripts per million (TPM) and transformed to log2(TPM \u00fe 1) before analyses. Given the strong asymmetry of data distribution, even after log transformation, the difference in expression among groups was tested with Mann-Whitney U-test (SciPy v1.4.1); resulting P values were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (statsmodels v0.11.0) 24,25 , resulting in FDR values.

Variants were present at low frequency (range 0% to 3%) among the different populations and did not differ significantly between genders (Fig. 7A) . Most of these variants had very low frequency (<0.2%); in particular, out of 178 variants identified, 10 for females and 11 for males had considerably higher frequency compared with the others (Fig. 7A) . In particular, we analyzed the variants in the region involved in the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 10 and identified possibly functional modifications (see section Methods) that may hinder viral docking and entry into target cells in the different ethnic groups. Interestingly, among those with the highest frequency, the variant S19P belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding site and it was exclusively present in Africans with a frequency of 0.2% (Fig.  7A) . In Finnish male, the E37 K variant was found with a frequency of 0.05%. According to a recent study, both mutations may affect the interaction with the virus to a certain extent 27 . We identified 261 TMPRSS2 variants across the ethnic groups with frequencies of up to 50% in African and Asian populations (Fig. 7B) . No differences in their frequency between males and females were observed.

Special attention should be paid to oncologic patients that are at an advanced age and are commonly affected by comorbidities. Treatment with single or combined chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or more recently immunotherapy may affect the immune status and cause adverse events. Therefore, we focused our research limited on the study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression variants and from healthy donors and cancer patients using public datasets, in order to potentially identify the individuals at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We supposed that the patients with a higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 could be more vulnerable because viral entry into host cells is facilitated given that a higher proportion of cells are expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 28 . It is reasonable to think that tumor patients whose cancers show high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may provide additional target cells for SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

Results from studies on the genetics of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are beginning to trickle in, evaluating if variants in the HLA genes or ABO blood type might play a role, but the findings are all preliminary and require follow-up with larger datasets 8 . With this retrospective study, we investigated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as susceptibility factors to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast to epidemiological evidences of higher mortality in elders, we found a higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in healthy tissues of young individuals. In contrast, regarding the tumor dataset, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in males with tumors with respect to females and in elderly patients suggesting they might be even more at risk and predisposed to higher chances of severe adverse events. Viral effects on humans are different, probably due to the heterogeneous individual susceptibility and to the different viral spreading and host immune response. Although the lungs are ground zero, symptoms can extend up to many organs, including the small intestine and kidneys probably due to high ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions. We also compared our expression data with the mRNA and protein expression levels reported on both the Tissue and Pathology Atlas databases of The Human Protein Atlas. The comparison showed that the data were concordant, and in particular, renal, colorectal, and stomach cancers had the highest levels of ACE2 protein expression, coherent with their own mRNA expression, while lung cancers had low or no detectable protein and mRNA expressions.",

According to literature data, we observed that the highest expression values of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were in the small intestine and this could explain the intestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been demonstrated yet. However, if confirmed, the virus could reach intestinal cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. These data might be relevant in light of the clinical manifestations of the disease. It is indeed believed that multiorgan failure in the advanced stages of COVID-19 is the result of an uncontrolled proliferation and activation of the immune system with a supraphysiological release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a resulting in witnessing a cytokine release syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 patients present with diarrhea in 2% to 50% of cases 30 , might show cardiac complications up to fibrillations, myocarditis, and heart arrest 31 , and are likely related to high ACE2 expression in the intestine and the heart, respectively. Importantly, patients with diarrhea remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the feces up to 12 days after disease onset, with a considerable fraction of individuals still negative if tested in the respiratory tract 32 . Hence, it is not surprising that traces of viral RNA have been detected in wastewater and sewers in several countries, and that disease spreading can be monitored through the analysis of wastewater 33 . Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still evolving and the fecal-oral route cannot be per se ruled out, also considering the extreme stability of the virus. Increasing evidence instead indicates a possible fecal-oral COVID-19 transmission 34 , defining a particularly high risk for populations in countries where hygienic measures and the availability of clean drinking water are inadequate. In these areas of the globe, specific measures should be considered.",

In addition, the high expression of TMPRSS2 in the healthy prostatic tissue and ACE2 in healthy testis is not surprising and could explain the higher incidence of COVID-19 in male subjects. Recently, impaired testosterone production from testes in males has been reported 36 , coherently with the corresponding tissues showing the highest ACE2 expression. In fact, androgens and androgen receptor (AR) have been known to affect ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions 37, 38 . This implies that patients with prostate cancer that are treated with anti-AR therapy could be less susceptible to viral infection. The use of anti-AR compounds could also be used as a therapeutic strategy and preventive option in these patients to avoid viral entry 38, 39 . In the future, other cancer types expressing AR, besides prostate cancer that can be treated with anti-AR compounds as a therapeutic option, would benefit from this type of treatment and could be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and likely to its most severe effects.",
