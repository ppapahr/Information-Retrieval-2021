If the current trend continues, the overweight and obese population is likely to increase to 41% by 2030. Individuals developing signs of weight gain or obesity are also at a risk of developing serious illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, respiratory problems, heart disease and stroke. Some intervention measures such as physical activity and healthy eating can be a fundamental component to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to detect childhood obesity as early as possible. This paper utilises the vast amount of data available via UK's millennium cohort study in order to construct a machine learning driven model to predict young people at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. The childhood BMI values from the ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 are used to predict adolescents of age 14 at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. There is an inherent imbalance in the dataset of individuals with normal BMI and the ones at risk. The results obtained are encouraging and a prediction accuracy of over 90% for the target class has been achieved. Various issues relating to data preprocessing and prediction accuracy are addressed and discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Obesity in general is a growing epidemic that affects every age group. In the UK alone, the economic impact of dealing with obesity and related illnesses is almost same as the other major issues affecting the economy such as smoking and armed conflict as reported in a publication by McKinsey Global Institute on Overcoming Obesity [1] . The report discusses that more than 30% of the world population is either overweight or obese. If this growth rate prevails, the proportion of people in overweight and obese category is likely to rise up to 41% by the year 2030. The report concludes by recommending behaviour change interventions which can result in saving money in the long run as a result of reduced healthcare and increase in productivity levels. Implementation of this type of intervention could save almost \u00a31 billion for the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom alone. The evidence suggests that the behavioural change interventions to combat obesity need further investigation to find workable solutions rather than waiting for a perfect solution. In the United Kingdom, the data presented in Health Survey for England reports that the percentage of obese children between the age of 2 and 15 has increased significantly since 1995 [2] . 16% of boys and 15% of girls in this age group were classed as obese. 14% of both genders were classed as overweight. This results in 30% of boys and 29% of girls being either overweight or obese. In 1995, 11% of boys and 12% of girls of 2-15 years of age were obese. A range of studies have however been monitoring the trend in obesity growth. One in specific included data from review included data from 467,294 children from Australia, China, England, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and USA [3] . It was reported that the prevalence of childhood obesity may be plateauing worldwide. Another survey identified 52 obesity studies worldwide from 25 countries and reported some stability in obesity [4] . Similar claims were made by [5] and [6] . Some reports even suggest that childhood obesity may well be declining as a cumulative result of increased physical activity, television viewing decline and reduction in sugary drink consumption [7] . However, [4] also reported that this stability should be observed with caution since previous stable phases were followed by further increases in prevalence of obesity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 335, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1262, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1785, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1989, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2023, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2031, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2232, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2247, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The Health Survey England (HSE) series was established to keep an eye on changes in nation's health [8] .

The purpose of this study is to carry out apply, analyse and evaluate machine learning algorithms to classify adolescents at a risk of becoming overweight or obese using early childhood BMI as input features to machine learning. The BMI in adults is defined as a ratio of body mass in kilograms to the square of individual's height in meters. In adults, BMIs of over 25 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2 are classed as overweight and obese respectively. This formula cannot be applied to children and adolescents since their body mass index changes significantly with age [14] . It varies between 13 kg/m 2 and 17 kg/m 2 from birth to an age of 1. It then decreases to 15.5 kg/m 2 at the age of 6 and increases to 21 kg/m 2 at the age of 20. Therefore, normal overweight and obesity thresholds can't be applied to children and adolescents.

A combination of several ML algorithms has also been successfully implemented to predict accurate amount of medication dosage required for patients suffering from sickle cell disease [22] . Administering accurate amount of medication based on patient's condition is of paramount importance. In this study, a range of combined machine learning techniques were investigated to accurately predict the correct amount of medication required. The algorithms investigated included Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and a few variants of Neural Networks. It was reported that a combination of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Random Forests provided the best results.

In this study, they used data collected on children prior to the second birthday using a clinical support system. They reported an accuracy of 85%, sensitivity of 89%, positive predictive value of 84% and negative predictive value of 88% using the ID3 algorithm for decision trees without pruning. The other algorithms tested were Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Trees, Random Forests, C4.5 decision trees with pruning and Bayes Net. Several other studies also reported the use of machine learning algorithms used for predicting obesity. Reference [26] suggested that Radial Basis ANNs (RBANNs) are far more efficient than classical Back Propagation ANNs (BPANNs) but very large datasets would be required to train such systems. This study discussed algorithms only; results were not reported. Reference [27] discussed several algorithms for predicting childhood obesity. They recommended the suitability of ANNs, Na\u00efve Bayes and Decision Trees. Several optimisation techniques have also been applied to achieve better prediction accuracy. For example, Genetic Algorithms were employed by [28] to improve the prediction accuracy to 92%. However, it must be noted that they used a very small sample size of 12 subjects. A comprehensive study, possibly the best one identified so far, was carried out by [29] to apply machine learning techniques to predict childhood obesity. They compared the performance metrics of several machine learning prediction algorithms. They compared logistic regression with six data mining techniques: Decision Trees, Association Rules, Neural Networks, Na\u00efve Bayes, Bayesian Networks and Support Vector Machines. They considered prediction sensitivity the most important element in predicting obesity for their study. The highest reported sensitivity for their work was 62% in the case of Na\u00efve Bayes and Bayesian Networks. This research group used a limited range of demographics (gender) and biometrics (weight, height and BMI) and the subjects were 2 year old children. It is envisaged that the prediction accuracy can be further improved by using a different set of parameters, using big data and other machine learning techniques such as deep learning to handle big data. Reference [30] applied machine learning techniques to measure and monitor physical activity in children. They evaluated Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Na\u00efve Bayes and K = 3 Nearest Neighbour algorithms. It was reported that MLPs outperformed all the other algorithms yielding an overall accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 99%.
