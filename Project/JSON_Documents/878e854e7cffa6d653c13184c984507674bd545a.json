Communication becomes even more important during public health crises such as pandemics. Drawing on Briggs and Hallin's concept of biocommunicability, we analysed the German National Pandemic Plan and key informant interviews with public health experts, critical infrastructure providers and ambulance services. We examined the projected expectations towards the behaviour of the audiences and the projected ways of information circulation informing public health communication strategies during a pandemic. Participants shared the expectation that the population would react towards an influenza pandemic with panic and fear due to a lack of information or a sensationalist media coverage. They associated the information uptake of their target audience with trust in their expertise. While our informants from public health conceptualised trust in terms of a face-to-face interaction, they sought to gain trust through transparency in their respective institutional settings. Our analysis suggests that this moved health information into a political register where their medical authority was open to debate. In response to this, they perceived the field of communication as a struggle for hegemony.",

            "text": "Health 00 (0) During the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, a circular email challenged the governmental vaccination campaign against the pandemic strain. The email claimed that the pandemic vaccines Pandemrix and Focetria caused Gulf War Syndrome. The email's author, a general practitioner, blamed the adjuvant squalene of causing a number of heterogeneous symptoms, such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, headaches and attention deficiency disorder. In a very urgent tone, the author sketched a scenario in which the burden of disease due to the pandemic vaccine would dwarf the effects of the pandemic itself. The circular email spread swiftly and became famous at a national level in Germany. Simultaneously, print media reported about two different vaccines for different population groups. Due to contracts of the Ministry for Domestic Affairs (Innenministerium) the vaccine Celvapan from Baxter was provided exclusively to the armed forces (Bundeswehr) and members of government (Bundesregierung) (Hackenbroch and Traufetter, 2009: 141) . The other vaccine, Pandemrix from GlaxoSmithKline, was meant for the general public and contained components whose side effects were fiercely debated. During the pandemic, coverage of vaccine-related topics and events was extensive. Especially, the organisation of the vaccination campaign, the topic of prioritisation of certain groups for vaccination and individual decisions concerning the vaccination by members of government were hotly debated (Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA), 2009: 11; Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS), 2009: 1; Hoischen, 2009: 3) . This panoply of events together produced an atmosphere that was poorly conducive for the ongoing public health vaccination campaigns. Thus, public health authorities unanimously complained about what they termed a 'communication disaster' that had emerged simultaneously with the unfolding pandemic (Krause et al., 2010: 516) .",

The second part contained the scientific background information and was authored by a committee of experts under the direction of Germany's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) (2016) . The National Pandemic Plan defines goals and their respective procedures, as well as responsibilities of actors within the state. The following four goals are identified: 'the reduction of morbidity and mortality within the population; ensuring treatment of sick persons; continuity of essential public services; timely provision of reliable information for policy makers, professionals, the public and the media' (GMK, 2016: 8) .

Typically, operative responses to public health crises were evaluated positively, whereas communication efforts were seen as either lacking or failing. We take this juxtaposition of preparedness capabilities as an entry point to engage with public health communication. The narrative of the communication disaster hints at the projected ways in which information is circulated and the expected behaviour of the audiences of communication. Rather than discuss the outcome of the public health campaigns, we draw on Briggs and Hallin's (2016) concept of biocommunicability to analyse the conceptualisation and practice of public health communication.",

Practices and technologies of communication are central to the way that biomedicalised subjects and objects are represented and constructed.

The moment of 'problematization' describes how one actor defines a problem and a possible solution. 'Interessement' refers to the process by which the first actor interests others in the identities, roles and functions they would fulfil in the solution to the problem definition. 'Enrolment' occurs when the actors actually fulfil their designated roles and associate in order to achieve the common agenda. The moment of 'mobilisation' describes the actual mobilisation and exchange of things between associated actors that is necessary to stabilise the network (Callon, 1986) . Important for our understanding of the concept of biocommunicability is that, similar moments are passed when one actor wants to convey health messages to an audience. Briggs and Hallin identified three models of biocommunicability that offer different problem definitions and solutions to how health should be communicated: the biomedical authority model, the patient-consumer model, and the public sphere model.",

Briggs and Hallin (2010: 151) liken this model to the relation between patient and family physician where the patient's 'proper role is to trust and obey' their doctor. Knowledge production takes place in a supposedly objective, highly specialised and technical sphere. In contrast, other spheres are projected as being dominated by populist, relativist or democratic communication ideologies. Biomedical authorities fulfil the role of the sole reliable sources of health information. Journalists participate in this model by translating health knowledge into popular discourses. The lay public is projected as receiving this information passively. Importantly, due to the necessary process of translation, which is mainly undertaken by journalists who are not part of this elite community of biomedical professionals, health coverage is always perceived as a distortion of the actual information (Briggs and Hallin, 2016: 25-30) .",

According to Briggs and Hallin (2010: 152) the patient-consumer model is the most prevalent model in most areas of health communication. It aligns well with conceiving of health services as a market with active, information seeking, medically literate patients making their own independent decisions. In this configuration, the physician takes the role of an informed adviser who works together with her patient/client to find the best solution. As a necessary prerequisite, the client has to be imagined as endowed with sufficient financial resources (Briggs and Hallin, 2016: 33-39) . Like in the biomedical authority model, biomedical professionals are the primary source of medical knowledge; but the patient-consumer model projects the patient as an active seeker of information. Both models have in common that they define the function of health information in terms of how 'it helps the individuals to regulate their behavior in the interest of their own health' (Briggs and Hallin, 2010: 152) .",

Panic was associated with certain projected behaviours. Importantly, not all of these behaviours were observed during the H1N1 Pandemic of 2009. They represented virtual possibilities of an acting public. Thus, in a first step we analysed how public health officers and medical staff perceived the public and what behaviours they expected. In a second step, we discuss the explanations our participants offered in regard to the perceived 'communication disaster' associated with the vaccination campaign outlined in the introduction. Our analyses centres on how our participants framed the failure and what they thought would have been an appropriate communication strategy to prevent this 'disaster' from happening again.",

Among these causes, a lack of knowledge and media coverage were mentioned most frequently.

When we asked her to delineate the most important agencies within the federal state with whom she collaborated in pandemic planning she first mentioned the local and regional public health authorities and the politicians. After this she moved on to depict the importance of collaboration with the federal state's Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs as well as the Ministry of Justice.",

A public in panic was perceived as the cause for a range of problems related to the number of people turning up at one place -too many or too few. Most of our participants from public health and the clinic defined fear as an outcome of insufficient and/or faulty information. For instance, nurse A who was responsible for training staff for work in the isolation ward explained that his colleagues felt uneasy working with infectious diseases at first. Participants in our study regarded the knowledge deficit about infectious diseases not only as a deficit of the general public. They also attributed it to medical staff and employees in the public administration and critical infrastructures. Behaviours such as staying away from work, forming crowds in the accident and emergency department, or not getting the flu shot were often interpreted as a result of this lack of knowledge. However, this knowledge void could be filled apparently easily by providing colleagues or the public with good information. Public health officer D was involved in revising the National Pandemic Plan. As a former paediatrician he compared communicating with the public to the situation in the surgery: But I think the individual needs reliable sources and a good basis. And then, I'm convinced, will he, fathers with their children -they will take a responsible stance, I think. That's my personal experience. So, if I have provided the parents with good advice, they can work with that. And this will already have positive effects on the child. So, if I reassure the parents, then the child will be calm as well. That is, reassuring in the sense of providing meaningful information so that they know what they can do, what they have to do. And that's here -That's why communication is so important (Public health officer D, March 2014).",

And in relation to the squalene problematic with the two vaccines and also due to the media coverage the uptake could not be maintained. And as a specialist for hygiene it was difficult for me to convey, that an influenza vaccination was necessary now to keep the ambulance service operational. But my colleagues were consternated by the supply of two different vaccines. There was talk about a VIP vaccine and a commoner vaccine of lower quality.

The German government had ordered another vaccine without these components. In October of 2009, just before the start of the vaccination campaign the media covered this story extensively with conflicting information on who would receive this other vaccine (e.g. Seidler, 2009) . The presence of a vaccine without adjuvants and preservatives for a selected group in Germany led to a discussion about the safety of the so-called commoner vaccine in the media. Public health officer D expressed his surprise about this discussion. For him everything had worked according to the published plan. According to public health officer D much criticism of the components of the pandemic vaccine could have been mitigated by explicitly communicating the ingredients before the vaccination campaign. Knowledge about the components of the vaccine is expected to create acceptance of the vaccination campaign. We call this communication strategy acceptance through familiarity. Here, the communicating person anticipates a knowledge gap in the audience. This strategy targets an audience that is expected to react uncooperatively towards an unexpected measure. By familiarising the audience with the measures the knowledge gap is mended and cooperative behaviours are thought to become more likely. Clinician A mentioned another instance of this strategy when he spoke about how journalists could be convinced to produce a less sensationalist coverage. Three participants working in the area of contingency management in companies that provided electricity, gas and water expressed their frustration with the prioritisation of certain sectors in the vaccination campaign. They defined themselves as critical infrastructure providers. Public statements by the health authorities had mentioned that critical infrastructures would be prioritised along with medical staff, police and the fire brigade. They therefore planned for vaccination campaigns in their companies. But when the vaccine became available they did not at first receive any vaccine.",

That on the part of the state communication of provisions is coordinated better.

And the media were grateful to cover it. And we all still remember the headlines (Critical infrastructure A1, September 2013). Due to the federal system in Germany and the different areas of jurisdiction between Federal Government, federal state and communal government it entails, for infection control and in (pandemic) crisis management it is inevitable, that the public and the media are addressed and spoken to by different official authorities. By coordinating procedures among authorities on the Federal and the state level it is to be ensured, that conveyed messages and recommendations are consistently given on the same information base and are not in contradiction to one another, so that emergence of uncertainty in the population and loss of trust in crisis management and crisis communication of public authorities is avoided.

This very much mirrors the results of Davis et al. (2011) on the problematisation of the general public in Australian pandemic control documents. In the German case, participants constructed the panicking public as a mass phenomenon that was disruptive of processes in two ways: either as a turning-up of too many people forming crowds at the wrong places, or as a turning-up of too few people at the right places, such as their workplaces. Participants from public health and hospitals attributed fear or panic to a lack of knowledge in the public as well as their colleagues. Communication strategies would have to target this affective register of the population. Our participants framed their strategies towards this register in terms of 'calming', 'familiarising' and 'understanding risks'.",

When patients trust their doctor, they stop looking for alternative options for action. In the words of public health officer D, they know 'what they have to do'. This is the prototypical relationship of the biomedical authority model of biocommunicability. However, this faceto-face relationship of trust is transformed in the context of crisis communication by official actors. Participants from public health interpreted trust in the sense of transparency. Transparency of procedures and the publishing of decision bases, as well as admitting limitations to knowledge, constituted public health authorities as accountable and addressed the public as citizenry. Addressing an audience as citizens moves health communication into a political register. Briggs and Hallin (2010: 152) refer to this mode of biocommunicability as the public sphere model. In this model health information becomes subject to open debate.",

Sometimes they come into conflict with one another, especially when participants talked about the vaccination campaign during the pandemic. Public debate revolved around belonging to a certain social class symbolised either by receiving a vaccine deemed safer or being part of a prioritised group. In this context one of our participants framed communication in a way similar to what the National pandemic plan calls a 'hegemony of communication in public opinion' (RKI, 2016: 192-193) . Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (2014 [1985] ) have transferred the Gramscian notion of hegemony to the analysis of discourses. Hegemony as a discursive concept describes the prevalence of certain patterns of production of social meaning (Laclau and Mouffe, 2014 [1985] : 91). From this perspective the debate about the safety of the vaccine was organised around the category of trust in both its political and affective registers. Brown and Calnan (2010) make a similar observation regarding the pharmaceutical industry where the perceived safety of drugs is often linked to trust in the manufacturer. Perceiving the vaccine as safe was in the eyes of the public health officers as much a matter of the public's understanding of science as of its mistrust in the sources of the information. In terms of the actor network perspective of biocommunicability hegemony is achieved by one actor if the actors it wishes to enrol (e.g. journalists, the public) recognise the framing of the issue (health or politics) and fulfil the roles assigned to them in the communication of health information.",

(2011) blaming the media but also blaming dissenters for the low uptake of vaccination helped some of our participants to make sense of the 'communication disaster'. Journalists are arguably the first audience when health authorities want to relay messages to the public. Framing the media as adversary rather than partner might impinge on the readiness to answer journalist's questions. One of our participants proposed to invite journalists to emergency exercises or meetings to discuss public health strategies with them. Briggs and Hallin (2016: 120-124 ) emphasise the role that journalists' participation in exercises played for the production of the media coverage of the H1N1 pandemic within the first 24 hours of its detection. Their account sounds a note of caution in regard to how too much familiarity with exercises influences journalists to write stories about actual outbreaks that resemble the rehearsed scenario.",

Coverage of issues of funding, prioritisation and safety of different vaccines followed the routines of political reporting opening the campaign to legitimate controversy. In addition, the dominance of the patient-consumer model might also complicate communication during a public health emergency. While outside of a crisis situation patients may actively seek information in order to maximise their health using all sources at their disposal, during the crisis public health authorities felt that they had to compete with these sources. In our interviews the one-voice policy emerged as a means to reduce the circulation of contradictory information from official sources. But this policy cannot (and should not) prevent controversy altogether. Our results as well as the recent debate about mandatory vaccination for measles for children in schools and nurseries suggest (e.g. Oltermann, 2019) , that the struggle for hegemony with respect to vaccination campaigns in Germany, at least in part, seems to be centred on the question of whether vaccination is negotiated according to the rules of medical sciences or politics. If this is the case then it would be prudent to actively foster public debate about vaccination rather than waiting for the next pandemic to occasion the debate.",

But the communication about it and the communication of what we did and did not know at the time, that worked relatively badly. This opinion was collectively shared. Much of what was known, or could have been known, was simply not known. On the other hand much of what was not known was underestimated. And this resulted in doubts and insecurity which were responded to rather reactively. Especially concerning the vaccine or components of the vaccine. And that the plan was not read. It's in there why the vaccine contains adjuvant and which adjuvant and for what. If you look it up you can see it. It's in the chapter of the 2007 plan on the table in front of you. But this was not communicated. We probably should have been more active in communicating this at the time (Public health officer D, March 2014).",

That is, to enable the survival of as many people as possible. Security always comes into play -what I've mentioned earlier; is the system breaking down? Are we heading towards a catastrophe? Are the financial authorities -very important -unable to operate. Then security comes into play. But, as I said earlier, actually the idea is, that as many [people] as possible consider, so that we don't even get into a catastrophic situation. But we can't rule it out. Because if the population is afraid and in 2009 they were, extremely so, although it [the pandemic] wasn't that severe, then it will be hard to control the hysteria. Interviewer: How would you control it? You have mentioned communication as a medium already. Public health officer E: Yes. Precisely. That's essential. As I said, clear propositions, clear announcements are ultimately the only thing you can do. Under certain circumstances you have to reckon with riots. Of course, we did. So it was reckoned with all sorts of things. One could raid vaccine transports. Do we need police protection for the vaccination sites? Do we need police protection at the pharmaceuticals issuing office and so on? Of course (Public health officer E, August 2014).",
