This knowledge is used in immune repertoire mining, where known binders are used to search bulk sequencing repertoires to identify new binders. However, current computational methods cannot identify epitope convergence between antibodies from different clonotypes, limiting the sequence diversity of antigen-specific antibodies that can be identified. We describe how the antibody binding site, the paratope, can be used to cluster antibodies with common antigen reactivity from different clonotypes. Our method, paratyping, uses the predicted paratope to identify these novel cross clonotype matches. We experimentally validated our predictions on a pertussis toxoid dataset. Our results show that even the simplest abstraction of the antibody binding site, using only the length of the loops involved and predicted binding residues, is sufficient to group antigen-specific antibodies and provide additional information to conventional clonotype analysis.",

            "text": "The starting point for most BCR repertoire analysis is the reduction of thousands or millions of BCRs into orders of magnitude fewer clonotypes. 5 Clonotype definitions vary, primarily through treatment of the complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3, but are intended to capture groups of clonally related antibody sequences derived from common progenitor B cells. 10 Published clonotyping methods use heavy chain information only, which is considered sufficient to capture most clonal relationships. 11 During B cell development, the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments encoding the variable domain of the antibody heavy chain undergo recombination. 12 A requirement for two sequences to be predicted to share the same clonotype is therefore common V-and J-germline gene assignment. 5 The D gene is not usually included in standard clonotype definitions because its assignment is both difficult and redundant in the clonotype definition, as it is wholly contained within the CDRH3. 13, 14 The variable domain of the antibody heavy chain consists of the framework regions and hypervariable CDRs. CDRHs 1 and 2 are encoded by the V gene while the region spanning the recombined V, D and J segments corresponds to the third and most diverse loop on the antibody heavy chain, the CDRH3. The processes of junctional diversification (the insertion of palindromic and random nucleotides at the junction between the V, D and J genes) during recombination act in tandem with somatic hypermutation 15 during affinity maturation to further increase the diversity of the CDRH3. Sequence identity in the CDRH3 is therefore included as a marker of shared origin in most clonotyping tools. 5 The nucleotide or amino acid sequence identity across the CDRH3 required for two sequences to be considered in the same clonotype varies across studies -in studies performing clonotyping with lengthnormalized amino acid sequence identity thresholds, sequence identity thresholds vary between 80% and 100%. 5 After recombination, the heavy chain is expressed as a pre-BCR with a surrogate light chain. The light chain is subsequently formed from the recombination of the V and J genes of either of the two light chain loci (lambda or kappa) 15 and is expressed by the immature B cell. While the light chain provides clonal signal, clonotyping has no established precedent using both heavy and light chains. Clonal inference for paired VH/VL sequences from single-cell sequencing has largely used heavy chains only; 16, 17 clonal inference within the BraCeR tool defines heavy and light chain clones separately. 18 We therefore refer to \"clonotyping\" as describing clonotyping using the heavy chain only.",

For example, Scheid and colleagues identified clonotypes from distinct immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene subgroups converging on the CD4 binding site in gp120. 29 Separate clonotypes have also been observed to bind to overlapping epitopes on the hemagglutinin stem 30 or globular head, and on multiple epitopes on the Ebola virus glycoprotein. 31 Wong and colleagues identified 190 pairs of antibodies with sub-80% CDRH3 amino acid identity binding to the same epitope within SAbDab. 28, 32 This convergence between clonotypes offers the potential to improve our understanding of the functional landscape of BCR repertoires; largescale functional convergence between lineages could, for example, explain the apparent scarcity of public clonotypes. 33 This hypothesis is supported by evidence that, while clonotypes are infrequently shared between individuals, the range of antibody structures that these clonotypes generate is more similar between individuals. 34 In the context of antibody discovery, being able to identify binders to the same epitope from different clonotypes would aid in optimization of developability or binding affinity, by allowing hopping between germline scaffolds.",

This process is referred to as \"immune repertoire mining\". Hsiao and colleagues performed clonotyping on a set of bulk heavy-chain repertoires and used the resultant clonotypes for hit expansion against two targets. 9 They achieved greater than an order of magnitude improvement in affinity for both targets and between 48% and 100% of tested heavy chain variants retained target-binding. 9 This suggests that sampling within a clonotype can be highly effective as a means of repertoire mining. However, the method does not allow the identification of binders to the same epitope that derive from different clonotypes, which currently limits the sequence distinctness of novel binders that can be recovered from immune repertoires.",

Paratyping simplifies the complex phenomenon of antibody-antigen interaction into sets of shared residues. Learning the complexities of antibody-antigen interactions as part of a predictive model of antigen binding has been achieved in the case of the antigen interaction of one therapeutic monoclonal antibody. 35 However, such approaches rely on a large (on the order of 10 4 ) library of experimentally validated binding and non-binding variants.

We then perform a prospective experimental test of the method by expressing as monoclonal antibodies and experimentally testing predicted PTx-binding and non-binding antibodies mined from a set of non-enriched bulk heavy chain sequencing repertoires. Our experimental test demonstrates that paratyping identifies PTx-binding antibodies from different clonotypes to our original hits. This expands the sequence space available through repertoire mining and permits favorable shifts in in silico developability metrics. Of particular advantage is paratyping's ability to predict common antigen reactivity of antibodies from different V and J gene backgrounds, which has implications for large-scale repertoire analysis.",

[28] [29] [30] [31] We hypothesize that these functionally convergent antibodies may use the same paratope for interaction, and examined SAbDab 32 for evidence that antibodies with similar paratopes bind to the same epitope. We defined the epitope and paratope as those residues with any atom within 4.5 \u00c5 of any residue in the cognate antibody or antigen, respectively, and consider only the heavy chains of the antibodies because in most BCR sequencing experiments only heavy chain sequences are available. 36 Figure 1 shows an example of a pair of antibody-antigen complex structures where antibodies binding to the same epitope derive from different clonotypes based on their heavy chains, but have very similar heavy chain paratopes. The two monoclonal antibodies 4C2 (PDB ID: 5do2) and D12 (PDB ID: 4zpv) bind to the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein at the same epitope (94.7% of epitope residues are shared across the pair of structures). In the standard clonotyping definition, an exact VH and JH match is required for grouping of two sequences regardless of treatment of the CDRH3; 5, 10 in this instance, the antibodies differ in both IGHV (IGHV5-6-4 vs IGHV5-9-1) and IGHJ gene (IGHJ2/ IGHJ4) and have lower CDRH3 identity (66.7%) than common definitions. However, 4C2 and D12 use largely the same paratope residues to achieve this epitope convergence, with 81.3% of heavy chain paratope residues conserved across the structures. Another example of epitope convergence between antibodies with differing IGHJ genes and sub-80% CDRH3 identity can be seen in the anti-lysozyme antibodies HyHel-10 and HyHel-63 (see Supplementary Figure 1 ; the heavy and light chain CDRs and V and J genes of both examples can be found in Supplementary Table 1) .",

As paratyping only groups of antibodies with the same length CDRs, we considered only the latter four developability metrics. Twenty-six of the original probe antibodies were flagged with extreme (2) or unobserved (24) values. Values are considered extreme (flagged as amber by TAP) if they fall within either the top or bottom 5% of the distribution of values observed in a set of 377 clinical-stage therapeutics (CSTs). 45 Values are unobserved (flagged as red by TAP) if they are outside of the range of values observed in existing CSTs. Seventeen of these probes were used in the identification of novel antibodies assayed for PTx binding, of which 13 successfully identified new PTx binders. For four of these probes, one of the new PTxbinding antibodies identified showed a sufficiently large change in the flagged developability metric that the flag was removed. There were a further five new PTx-binding antibodies showing a shift in the flagged developability metric toward the mean value among CSTs. Figure 6 shows the improvement in patch surface hydrophobicity achieved by immune repertoire mining using CL-95375 as a probe antibody. CL-95375 had an amber flag for this metric. Repertoire mining was used to identify a number of predicted PTx-binding antibodies. It can be seen that the more sequence-distinct paratype-only predictions are able to achieve greater changes in patch surface hydrophobicity (PSH). These predictions were not assayed as they were within the clonotype of another known binder, and therefore not \"paratypeunique\".",

These include antibodies that use different germline genes as well as antibodies with lower CDRH3 identity than in common definitions (80-100%). In terms of antibody discovery, paratyping allows us to identify sequence-distinct antibodies that bind to the same epitope and that can differ significantly in developability or affinity. In the terms of repertoire analysis, paratyping expands our ability to functionally group antibodies beyond clonotypes, and therefore allows us to detect specific cases of epitope convergence between clonotypes. For example, we found epitope convergence between IGHV4-34/IGHJ6 and IGHV4-59/IGHJ6 clonotypes, IGHV4-39/IGHJ6 and IGHV4-39/IGHJ4 clonotypes, IGHV4-34/IGHJ5 and IGHV4-34/IGHJ4 clonotypes and IGHV5-51/IGHJ4 and IGHV5-51/IGHJ6 clonotypes in PTx binders. We did not observe pairs of antibodies in the same paratype using different V gene subgroups, but antigenreactive antibodies with identical CDRH3s deriving from different V gene subgroups have been observed, suggesting that this convergence does occur. 46 Paratope identity across the germline-encoded CDRHs 1 and 2 is equal to or in excess of 75% across members of IGHV1 and IGHV7, and IGHV3 and IGHV4 (see Supplementary Figure 4 ), so we predict that it should be possible to use paratyping to find binders from different V gene subgroups, should a large enough sequencing data set be mined. The implications of this for immune repertoire clustering are as yet unexplored. If such convergence is widespread, it is possible that clonotyping overestimates functional diversity, and this may account for low proportions of clonotypes shared across individuals. 3, 47 Success rates in the prospective experimental validation were variable across the categories of prediction. We found that 90% of sequences predicted by both clonotyping and paratyping to be binders bound PTx. The success rate was considerably lower in clonotype-unique predictions (65%) and even lower in paratype-unique predictions (30%). It should be noted that these method-unique predictions Figure 4 .

Finally, 10 \u03bcl of anti-mouse IgG donor antibody (Southern Biotech; to bind to murine constant region in control and chimeric Intelliselect transgenic mouse antibodies) labeled with europium cryptate (Cis Bio), (1:4000 final concentration) was added to each well and the assay was left in the dark at room temperature to incubate for 2 h. After incubation, the assay was read on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a standard HTRF protocol. Then, 620 and 665 nm channel values were exported to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and F calculations performed ((665/620 nm ratio -signal negative control)/signal negative control) \u00d7 100). Percent effect values were calculated for each antibody by comparing its F value against a positive control antibody (ab37574) at 6.66 nM. The number of PTx-positive antibodies as a function of percentage effect values are shown in Figure 7a .",

Other sequences which are in the same paratype or clonotype are predicted to also bind PTx. These predicted PTx binding sequences are colored according to whether they are identified by both paratyping and clonotyping (\"Both\"), paratyping but not clonotyping (\"Paratype-only paratyping but not clonotyping\") or clonotyping but not paratyping (\"Clonotype-only\"). Circular leaves represent true PTx binding antibodies (i.e., true positives) while triangular leaves represent sequences that do not bind PTx (false positives). Dendrogram A shows the probe which had the most \"clonotype-only\" predictions, of which 70% are true positives; dendrogram B shows the probe with the most \"paratype-only\" predictions, of which 75% are true positives; dendrogram C is the probe antibody which is associated with the most false positives (33% true positives) while dendrogram D is the probe antibody associated with the most true positives (20 true positives). Performance is heterogeneous across probes ranging between 33% and 100% precision; precision and recall values reported elsewhere in this manuscript consider the performance in aggregate of all 364 probes. IGHV, IGHJ or IGK/LV genes are annotated where this changes within a dendrogram. It can be seen that PTx-binding is abrogated by all instances of a change in IGK/LV gene. Dendrograms are constructed using the full VH sequence with the neighbor-joining algorithm of the R package ape, 40 plotted using the R package ggtree. 41 The units of the scale bar are amino acid substitutions per residue.",
