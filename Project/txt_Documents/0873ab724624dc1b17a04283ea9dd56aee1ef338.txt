The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Simtomax ® CoronaCheck, a 26 serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for the detection of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. 48 plasma 27 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR and 98 negative control samples were studied.

Significance (p-values) were calculated using a Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. The demographic characteristics of patients' samples was as follows: the 48 COVID-19-positive 132 samples were from patients older (median = 49 years old, IQR 33-58.75) compared to the healthy 133 patients (n=98) (median = 34.5 years old, IQR 18-44.75; p < 0.05). The proportion of females was 56% 134 (n=20) and 51% (n=50) in the COVID-19 positive and in the healthy control group, respectively. Among the COVID-19 samples, the median delay between symptom onset and sampling was 21 days 136 (IQR 16-32 days), but not less than 10 days. The longest DPS (one single sample) was 180 days.  The diagnostic specificity of the IgG/IgM RDT was assessed on the COVID-19 negative control group 142 with a sampling date before 2018 (n=98).

The accuracy of the IgG/IgM RDT was also assessed using an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay  The two false-negative results exhibited a DPS between 10 and 15. When using exclusively the results 180 in the ? 15 DPS group, there was a complete agreement between the results of the IgG/IgM RDT and 181 ECLIA. In this case, the IgG/IgM RDT sensitivity (SE) was therefore 100% (95% CI: 79-100), while 182 the PPV was 86% (95% CI: 64-96) and the NPV 100% (95% CI: 95-100). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted November 1, 2020.  It is interesting to notice that the two false-negative results obtained with Augurix RDT corresponded is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted November 1, 2020.  The second notable finding of this study lies in the fact that IgG seropositivity is still present 180 days  This study indicates also that a certain titer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG is present constantly with a 235 concentration sufficient to be detectable with RDT, from 15 days to at least 180 days post symptoms. .

In addition, the test provided clear results without indeterminate or invalid measurements. There are 240 however several limitations to this study. First, we present here the results of a method evaluation study 241 and not a seroprevalence study. Therefore, the PPV obtained here (based on a 32.9% proportion of cases 242 defined as laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR) will be lower in a low prevalence setting, 243 e.g. when testing the asymptomatic population. Another limitation of this validation study lies in the 244 limited sample size leading to broad 95% confidence intervals, requiring confirmation of these data at a 245 larger scale. Also, here we used plasma and the test was performed in a laboratory environment; we may 246 expect different results in real-life at patients' bed and using capillary blood. Finally, our present 247 conclusions only apply to the Augurix RDT, and must not be generalized to other currently available 248 RDTs. In conclusion, Augurix RDT is not meant to replace a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic test in the first 250 week of the disease, but could be a reliable option for assessing the SARS-CoV-2 serology in moderate is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted November 1, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20219667 doi: medRxiv preprint .
