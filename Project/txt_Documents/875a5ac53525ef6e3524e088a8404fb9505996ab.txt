Identifying transcriptional responses that are most consistently associated with 16 experimental coronavirus (CoV) infection can help illuminate human cellular signaling 17 pathways impacted by CoV infection. Here, we distilled over 3,000,000 data points from 18 publically archived CoV infection transcriptomic datasets into consensus regulatory 19 signatures, or consensomes, that rank genes based on their transcriptional 20 responsiveness to infection of human cells by MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 21 subtypes. We computed overlap between genes with elevated rankings in the CoV 22 consensomes against those from transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq consensomes for nearly 23 880 cellular signaling pathway nodes. Validating the CoV infection consensomes, we 24 identified robust overlap between their highly ranked genes and high confidence targets 25 of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. We then developed a 26 series of use cases that illustrate the utility of the CoV consensomes for hypothesis 27 generation around mechanistic aspects of the cellular response to CoV infection. We 28 make the CoV infection datasets and their universe of underlying data points freely 29 accessible through the Signaling Pathways Project web knowledgebase at 30 https://www.signalingpathways.org/datasets/index.jsf. : bioRxiv preprint Josset et al., 2013; Sims et al., 2013; Yoshikawa et al., 2010). To date however the field 56 has lacked a resource that fully capitalizes on these datasets by, firstly, using them to 57 rank human genes according to their transcriptional response to CoV infection and 58 secondly, contextualizing these transcriptional responses by integrating them with 59 'omics data points relevant to host cellular signaling pathways. Here, as a service to the 60 research community to catalyze the development of novel CoV therapeutics, we 61 generated consensomes for infection of human cells by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 62 CoVs. We then analyzed the extent to which high confidence transcriptional targets for 63 these viruses intersected with genes with elevated rankings in transcriptomic and ChIP-64 Seq consensomes for cellular signaling pathway nodes. Integration of the CoV 65 consensomes with the existing universes of SPP transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data 66 points in a series of use cases illuminates previously uncharacterized intersections 67 between CoV infection and human cellular signaling pathways. The CoV infection 68 consensome and its underlying datasets provide researchers with a unique and freely 69 accessible framework within which to generate and pressure test hypotheses around 70 human cellular signaling pathways impacted by CoV infection. : bioRxiv preprint 93 transcription factor (Supplementary information, Section 2, columns W-Z). As an initial 94 benchmark for the ALL CoV consensome, we assembled a list of 20 interferon-95 stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode many of the key canonical viral response 96 factors (Supplementary information, Section 2, column I) (Schneider et al., 2014).
