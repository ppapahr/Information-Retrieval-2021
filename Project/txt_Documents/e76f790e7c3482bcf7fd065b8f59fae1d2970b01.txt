Effectiveness of Clinical Examination in Cancer Surveillance: New Paradigm to Cancer Survivorship Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic Madam d Significant oncology care reorganisation has Q1 been triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with national guidance urging the avoidance of unnecessary face-to-face consultations and expediting stratified follow-up to incorporate virtual and remote clinics [1] . The roles of cancer follow-up are to detect early recurrence, monitor treatment side-effects and provide on-going support of patients. Variability exists in the follow-up after definitive treatment according to cancer sites. In oesophageal cancer, the recommendation is for patients to be discharged [2] after curative treatments if there is no visible disease after evaluation. For Q2 head and neck cancer, regular clinical examinations are recommended e 2 monthly for the first 2 years and subsequently 3e6 monthly up to 5 years [3] . Current clinical trials mandate a physical examination during the follow-up period. In most asymptomatic patients, this is unlikely to detect any clinical significant findings. Emerging evidence has questioned the effectiveness of routine clinical examinations in detecting cancer recurrence [4] . Increasingly, trials are looking at adopting digital healthcare, with the use of patient-reported outcomes to monitor patients after treatment [5] . In devising future follow-up strategies, cancer clinicians should consider integration with shared care with primary care, allowing tests to be carried out locally. Clear responsibility and stewardship must be in place on ownership of the test results. Future cancer surveillance must incorporate quality assurance and regular audit cycles to ensure no missed cancer recurrence and that patient feedback is listened to. Increasing evidence shows the superiority of magnetic resonance imaging compared with computed tomography in the detection of cancer recurrence [3] , with less radiation risks. Urgent research is required to determine the most effective follow-up radiology modalities, frequency of follow-up and tailoring these with individual cancer sites and patient needs. The role of patient education is more important than ever. Oncologists need to review the role of routine clinical examinations and adopt innovative and pragmatic new approaches to cancer survivorship.
