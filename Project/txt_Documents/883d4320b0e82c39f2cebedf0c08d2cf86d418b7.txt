We evaluated widely-used SARS-CoV-2 serological tests and their potential 37 association with virus neutralization test (VNT) in a cohort of mild COVID-19 patients. 38 Methods: A total of 439 specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers 39 with RT-PCR-confirmed mild COVID-19. Nine serological assays developed by leading 40 global companies (Abbott, DiaSorin, Siemens, Bio-Rad, Wantai, bioM?rieux, Euroimmun) 41 were assessed. For each test the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined 42 weekly after symptom onset. Correlation and concordance were assessed using the Spearman 43 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients, respectively. Positive percent agreement and negative 44 percent agreement (NPA) with the VNT were also determined. 45 Results: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the 46 S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The 47 best correlation between antibody level and neutralizing antibody titer was found with the 48 Euroimmun S1-based IgA assay (Spearman coefficient [95%CI]: 0.71 [0.61-0.79]). A 49 moderate concordance (Kappa [95%CI]: 0.43[0.23-0.63]) as well as the lowest NPA (33%) 50 was found between the Wantai Total Ab assay and the VNT. Compared to the Wantai Total 51
The evaluation of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with serological tests is 59 crucial to further manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Serological 60 testing represents an easy to implement and cost-effective method allowing to rapidly identify 61 individuals exposed to the virus [1, 2] . Over the last few months, a large number of SARS-62 CoV-2 commercial assays have been evaluated for their ability to detect specific antibodies 63 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies does not indicate whether 64 or not the antibodies are functional for neutralizing the virus. In association with the 65 evaluation of other immune responses, such as cellular immunity, the determination of 66 neutralizing antibody titer is important to evaluate the protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 67 after infection and therefore the risk of reinfection [9] [10] [11] . While the comparison of sensitivity 68 and specificity of serological tests has been increasingly studied, the association between the 69 results obtained with commercial tests and the virus neutralization test (VNT) has been 70 explored in only a few studies, and mostly among severe COVID-19 patients [12, 13] . VNT is 71 considered as the reference to assess the functional ability of antibodies to block the entry of 72 the virus into human cells [14] . However, such an assay requires living virus manipulated in a 73 biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility that needs trained staff and specific equipment, and which is 74 a tedious and time-consuming method. The first study exploring the association of 75 commercial serological assays and VNT claimed that the Wantai Total Ab assay detecting 76 total antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) had the 77 best characteristics to detect functional antibodies at different stages and severity of disease 78 [12] . The RBD, within the sub-unit S1 of the spike protein, enables the viral entry into human 79 cells by fixing to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [15] . As emphasized 80 by the authors [12] , there is an urgent need for further studies addressing the performance of 81 .

Positivity was established according to threshold value recommended by each 107 manufacturer. As previously suggested, we also evaluated a cut-off (OD ratio ? 10) to 108 indicate the presence of protective antibodies for the Wantai Total Ab assay [12] . 109 The VNT used for the detection and titration of neutralizing antibodies was performed as 110 previously described [17] . Briefly, a ten-fold dilution of each serum specimen in culture 111 medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing antibiotics and 2% foetal calf 112 serum) was first heated for 30 min at 56°C to avoid complement-linked reduction of the viral 113 activity. Serial two-fold dilutions (tested in duplicate) of the serum specimens in culture 114 medium were mixed at equal volume with the live SARS-CoV2 virus. After gentle shaking 115 and a contact of 30 minutes at room temperature in plastic microplates, 150 µL of the mix was 116 transferred into 96-well microplates covered with Vero E6 cells. The plates were incubated at 117 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The reading was evaluated microscopically 5 to 6 days later 118 when the cytopathic effect of the virus control reached 100 TCID 50 /150 µL. Neutralization 119 was recorded if more than 50% of the cells present in the well were preserved. The 120 neutralizing titer was expressed as the inverse of the higher serum dilution that exhibited 121 neutralizing activity; a threshold of 20 was used. All experiments were performed in a BSL3 122 laboratory. The comparison of this VNT with a standardized assay using retroviruses pseudo-123 typed with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein found a high correlation and concordance 124 [17] . 125 .

Total Ab assay, the differences were significant before 14 days post-symptom onset with all 151 other assays, except with the Euroimmun and Bio-Rad assays; after 14 days post-symptom 152 onset, the differences were significant with all other assays. 153 Regarding specificity, no false positive result was found using 30 pre-pandemic sera, although 154 3 samples gave a borderline ratio (between 0.8 and 1.1) with the Euroimmun IgA assay 155 (supplementary table 1) . 156 .

The best correlation between commercial kits and VNA was found with the Euroimmun S1- Wantai Total Ab; 18 these had an OD ratio < 10. Of note, 9/30 samples were collected more 182 than 14 days post symptom onset. Regarding the samples with an OD ratio < 10 with the 183 Wantai Total ab assay (39/140, 28%), all had a low level of neutralizing antibodies (range: 184 20-50; Figure 1 ). 185 .

The NPA ranged from 33.3% [21.1-48 .3] for the Wantai Total Ab assay to 96.8% for the 186 DiaSorin and was < 90% for 7/9 assays. The PPA was > 90% for all tests except the DiaSorin 187 and the two IgM based assays (Wantai and bioM?rieux) ( Table 2) . 188 .

These findings are highly consistent with those of the present study that found a NPA below 207 90% for all tests except for bioM?rieux IgG and DiaSorin. In contrast, it is interesting to note 208 that the Wantai Total Ab had the lowest NPA (33%). Furthermore, the concordance between 209 VNT and the Wantai Total Ab assay was only moderate while the concordance was 210 substantial with bioM?rieux IgG, DiaSorin, Siemens, Abbott, Euroimmun and Bio-Rad. The 211 low NPA and moderate concordance noticed for the Wantai Total Ab might be partially 212 explained by the excellent ability of this test to detect RBD-specific antibodies at the very 213 early phase of infection, irrespective of their neutralizing properties in line with the delay 214 required for antibody maturation [18] . In the first study comparing VNT with commercialized 215 tests, the authors found that the Wantai Total Ab assay had the best characteristics to detect 216 functional antibodies in different stages and severity of disease [12] . However the median 217 interval between the onset of symptoms and sample collection was 43 days for mild patients 218 (n=71 samples) and thus the antibodies could be detected with both the Wantai Total Ab and 219 .

As the authors used VNT as the gold-standard for sensitivity 220 assessment, this explains the difference in findings with the present study [12] . 221 Importantly, as previously reported by others [18, 19] , not all RBD-binding antibodies have 222 neutralizing properties which is consistent with that reported herein regarding the RBD-based 223 assays that do not have perfect concordance with VNT. Conversely, serological assays 224 targeting a region other than the S protein may be associated with functional information, as 225 previously reported [14, [20] [21] [22] . In the present study, the Abbott and Bio-Rad assays directed 226 against the N protein presented a substantial concordance with VNT as N-directed and RBD-227 neutralizing antibodies can be produced concomitantly over the course of the disease. 228 In addition to the different targeted antigens, the heterogeneity in assay performance found 229 herein could also be explained by various factors including the detected isotypes. The present study does, however, have certain limitations. For instance, specificity was not 236 been extensively studied; yet the Euroimmun IgA assay seemed to have the worst specificity, 237 which is consistent with previous studies reporting a lack of specificity for this assay [5, 6, 12] . The results presented herein obtained from mild COVID-19 patients confirm that, for 245 exposure assessment, the Wantai Total Ab assay should be preferred to other commercial kits 246 due to a very high sensitivity. For evaluating protective immunity, the Wantai Total Ab assay 247 with an optimized cut-off or other tests targeting the S protein as Euroimmun, DiaSorin or 248 bioM?rieux IgG could be more useful, notably to screen serum specimens candidate for the 249 presence of neutralizing antibodies. However, these tests or others cannot substitute a VNT 250 for assessing functional antibody response; neutralizing assays remain the gold standard and 251 easy-to-use tests, such as those based on pseudoviruses [6,17,24], should be developed and 252 standardized. Furthermore, the recent development of surrogate virus neutralization tests 253 based on antibody-mediated blockage of the interaction between ACE-2 receptor and the 254 RBD is very promising as they were designed in an ELISA format enabling high-throughput 255 testing [19, 25] . 256 In conclusion, the present study provides original data concerning the performance of widely-257 used serological tests, which could help diagnostic laboratories in the choice of a particular 258 assay according to the intended use. 259 .
