Norwegian emergency departments (EDs) are integrated divisions of the hospital. Although acutely ill patients may arrive directly, EDs receive mainly pre-triaged patients from community doctors and local emergency medical centres. Early in the pandemic, recommended criteria for referring suspected COVID-19 patients to hospital were disseminated by the AUH Department of Infectious Disease to ensure timely referral (Table S1 ). Upon ED arrival, patients were immediately evaluated by a medical doctor in a dedicated triage area including facilities for chest x-ray and arterial blood gas analysis. A protocolized triage system defined eligibility for hospitalization. Suspected COVID-19 patients in obvious respiratory distress were met by a fully equipped critical care team; stable patients were treated in dedicated isolation wards. Patients' physical reserve and burden of comorbid conditions were evaluated early to support potential decisions on treatment limitations. Chronological age alone was not considered a valid reason for withholding advanced treatment, for example, mechanical ventilation. Detailed protocols for safe stabilization, intubation and intrahospital patient transfer were developed and disseminated by intensive care physicians in close cooperation with infectious disease specialists, ED doctors and nurses. Early on-site simulation training was used to evaluate and improve the protocols. On COVID-19 isolation wards, senior physicians monitored each patient. If pre-specified severity thresholds for National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), flow rates of supplemental oxygen necessary to obtain specified oxygen saturations, or patient exhaustion at rest and during ambulation were reached, a dedicated on-call ICU doctor immediately evaluated the patient for need of transfer to the ICU for mechanical ventilation (Table S2 ). Overall counts of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in AUH's catchment area were obtained from the Norwegian Surveillance System for C ommunicable Disease (MSIS), Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Overall counts and discharge survival status of admitted SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at AUH were obtained from the hospital pandemic registry. Data for included patients were manually collected from electronic hospital records. These included high-resolution data from In this prospective observational study of COVID-19 patients needing mechanical ventilation in a single university hospital system, the clinical experience is reported which can be compared to other reporting centres. medical equipment, survival status at the time of review (updated from the Norwegian Population Registry) and discharge summaries from a collaborating hospital to which some ICU patients were transferred for capacity reasons or, in one instance, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinical and ventilator data were noted for the following time points: (1) ED arrival, (2) immediately before ICU admission, (3) best 6-hour period during the initial 24 hours after start of mechanical ventilation, (4) worst 24-hour period on mechanical ventilation and (5) 6-hour period immediately before extubation/death. The ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 / FiO 2 -ratio) was used to determine these periods. ARDS severity was graded as severe (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ?13.6 kPa), moderate (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio 13.7-26.7 kPa) and mild (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio 26.7-40 kPa). 4 The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was 30-day mortality. Mechanical ventilation was carried out according to a dedicated COVID-19 ARDS protocol, which was posted in every ICU room. Overall ICU treatment strategy is summarized in Table S3 . Based on early reports on sudden respiratory deterioration in COVID-19 patients 5 and concern about staff safety, we aimed for early intubation and restricted the use of non-invasive ventilation. The routine anticoagulation protocol in COVID-19 patients was subcutaneous dalteparin 5000 IU ? 2 for bodyweight <75 kg and 7500 IU ? 2 for bodyweight ?75 kg. Dalteparin doses were adjusted at the treating physician's discretion in response to D-dimer levels. Data are medians with 25th-75th centiles if not stated otherwise. Linear mixed-effects multiple regression (Fit Model platform, Method REML, SAS-JMP13, SAS Institute, NC, USA) was used to analyse the increase in thrombocyte count with time, using subject identity as random effect to account for correlation between repeated observations within the same subject. and 47% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity. Symptom duration before hospitalization was 9 (5-11) days. Patients presented with isolated respiratory failure. Patients treated with mechanical ventilation were more often male, presenting lower oxygen saturations and systolic blood pressure and higher body temperature, respiratory rate, NEWS2, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level on ED arrival. The proportion of patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease and use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers was similar in mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients. On ICU admission, patients were severely respiratory distressed, hypoxaemic and often hypocapnic, but with stable circulatory measurements ( instituted immediately after ED arrival, while 25 patients were transferred to the ICU after median 2 [range 1-6] days ( Figure 1 ). ICU treatments and outcomes are listed in Table 3 . Illness courses were protracted; ICU stays exceeded 40 days in one of four survivors. Maximum hospital stay was 83 days. Many patients were discharged to rehabilitation facilities rather than their home. of analysed samples, and peak levels were especially high in non-survivors (Table 3) . Abrupt D-dimer peaks were also observed late in the course of illness. Doses of administered dalteparin were high. No patient had overt bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or puncture sites. Red blood cell transfusions were given to four survivors for moderate anaemia during prolonged ICU stays and to one non-survivor after clotting of a haemodialysis circuit. The main finding of this observational prospective cohort study, comprising all ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 in our catchment area, was a comparatively low hospital and 30-day mortality rate of 13%. Though limited by a small study sample, this rate is far lower than reported early from Chinese, 1 Italian 6 and US 7, 8 cohorts and compares favourably with studies presented in a recent meta-analysis where overall ICU mortality was 40.2%. 2 19%) was similar to that in New York and California, [7] [8] [9] but lower than reported from Wuhan, China (33%), 10 metropolitan Detroit (32%) 11 and designated COVID-19 centres in Vancouver, Canada (63.2%). 12 Clearly, population care-seeking behaviour and institutional admittance and transfer policies will affect such numbers. Severity of respiratory failure in our cohort was substantial: 70% and 25% of patients fulfilled the Berlin criteria 4 for moderate and severe ARDS respectively. Overall case fatality rate, defined as number of deaths per SARS-CoV-2 positive test, was 2.65% in Norway in the study period (www.fhi.no). Though clearly a crude and biased measure of COVID-19 mortality, this case fatality rate was nevertheless in the lower range of published estimates. 13 With 1484 persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in our catchment area, the 13 COVID-19 deaths at AUH amount to one third of expected fatalities. Norwegian national statistics show that 64% of COVID-19 fatalities have been patients ?80 years old (www.fhi.no), mostly residents in nursing homes. This suggests that hospital referral rates from our primary healthcare system were conservative, and comparable to other nationalized healthcare systems. 14  Patient age, the main determinant for outcome in COVID-19, was 61 (53-70) years in this cohort of mechanically ventilated patients. This is similar to ICU data from the UK (60 (51-68) years; ICU mortality 41%), 14 Italy (61 (50-72) years; 30-day mortality 19.7%), 15 the US (61 ± 16 years; mortality 25%) 16 and Canada (69 (60-75) years; mortality 17%). 12 As in previous studies, 6,7,14 a high proportion were male. Non-Caucasian ethnicity was common, but not over-represented among mechanically ventilated patients. UK data have suggested that Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients have increased risk of fatal outcome in COVID- 19. 17 The burden of comorbidities in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients at AUH was comparable to findings from China, Italy and Canada, 1,6,10,12 while US cohorts had much higher prevalence of heart disease (71%), hypertension (52%-79%), diabetes (43%-52%) and chronic kidney disease (59%). 8, 9, 11, 18 Obesity, an established risk factor for poor outcome in COVID-19, 15, 19 was found in 31% of our cohort. This is a higher prevalence than reported from Italy and China 15,20 but lower than reported from USA (46%-62%) 8, 9, 11, 18 and France (73%). 19 Overall, our population may have been in the midrange of risk due to comorbidities. The ICU department experienced a rapid surge situation to a threefold increase in mechanically ventilated patients compared to ordinary operation. New ICU areas were opened and extensive use of non-specialist nurses to tend ventilated patients was necessary. By putting all non-oncologic elective surgery on hold, the number of intensivists and ICU competent anaesthesiologists on call could be increased. Our institution thus could respond with adequate resources to the sudden increase in demand; this could have played a role in keeping mortality rates low. Adherence to ARDS goals for protective ventilation was surprisingly tight ( Figure 2 ) given a high patient load and many non-specialist nurses in the ICU. The finding probably resulted from a clearly communicated ventilator strategy for COVID-19 patients (Table S3) Vasopressors were used at modest rates to uphold blood pressure and diuresis in deeply sedated patients. Circulatory shock was uncommon; during their most critical phase, only one in 20 survivors received noradrenaline doses >0.19 µg/kg/min. Intravascular volume resuscitation was performed at the treating physician's discretion, and non-survivors received more fluids than survivors (Table 3) . Still, close attention to fluid balance resulted in very modest median weight gains over the first ICU week. (Table 3) , but haemodialysis was used only in two non-survivors, that is, 5% of the entire cohort. This is markedly lower than rates of haemodialysis reported from COVID-19 ICU cohorts in New York (35%), 8 Atlanta (29%) 18 and Detroit (17%) 11 USA, Vancouver, Canada (14%), 12 the UK (27%) 14 and China (20%). 1 Reasons for this notable difference are unclear and probably multifactorial, but varying prevalence of hypertension and chronic renal failure likely contributed. Enteral nutrition was started per protocol and also continued during prone positioning. Enteral feeding facilitates fluid restriction, particularly if given as high-energy formulae. Corticosteroids were avoided in all patients due to fear of prolonged viral shedding and pulmonary superinfection. 21 Remdesivir was not given. Two early thromboembolic events prompted departmental consensus on increasing dalteparin dosing in COVID-19 patients from regular prophylaxis (5000 IU once daily) to treatment doses and above (Table S3 ). There was no randomized controlled trial to support this strategy, but an association between hypercoagulative states and death had been reported. 1  Strengths of this study are its prospective design and complete data on ICU admissions, clinical course and long-term outcomes for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in our institution's catchment area. Limitations are small sample size and lack of exact numbers of out-of-hospital COVID-related deaths. Extrapolations from national data carry uncertainties, as deaths in nursing homes were unevenly distributed. Our findings should be generalizable to settings with high coverage of medical treatment and adequate hospital surge capacity. In settings where primary and hospital healthcare services are less developed or less available, the general health of the population and therefore its resilience to COVID-19 may be poorer. In a prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in a resource-rich, publicly financed healthcare system with universal coverage, hospital and 30-day mortality were lower than reported in previously published retrospective studies. High adherence to defined triage and ARDS treatment protocols including aggressive anticoagulation therapy was achieved, despite unusually high demand on ICU resources.
