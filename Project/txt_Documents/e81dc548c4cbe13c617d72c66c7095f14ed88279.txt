Most commercial next-generation sequencing services can require 4 to 6 weeks to sequence samples. As a result, when designing the course, the instructor should consider: • Performing environmental DNA extraction early in the course. • Using the wait-time for the class to perform related experiments. In this course, the students conducted chemical analyses of water samples. • Using real-time technologies such as Oxford Nanopore (Oxford, United Kingdom) MinION sequencing (Brown et al., 2017; Mitsuhashi et al., 2017) . Uploading metadata into MG-RAST (Meyer et al., 2008) . The metadata formatting requirements for MG-RAST is precise and somewhat cryptic. As a result, student submissions of the metadata file often failed validation. The following strategies may help overcome the bottleneck: • Download the metadata Excel template provided by MG-RAST • Have students watch the metadata entry video tutorial produced by Argonne National Laboratory (2012). • Have multiple students work on metadata entry. Once a student is successful in having their metadata file validated, share that file with the other students. Time for MG-RAST homology search Because of the high volume of work on the MG-RAST supercomputer complex (Meyer et al., 2017) , it can take a few days from the time sequence data is uploaded into MG-RAST until the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts are produced. To reduce the time for data processing: • Only submit sequence data files once. The students can aggregate sequence datasets using identification numbers generated by MG-RAST. • Choose the option of making the sequence data immediately available. The data queue processing algorithm places the highest priority on public data. Data Analysis on MG-RAST Because of the huge dataset in MG-RAST and its high demand on classroom wireless internet, the students may experience difficulties using the analysis tools. To remedy the bottleneck: • Export the OTU count data at the species level as a tabdelimited file. • Use a spreadsheet to delete undesired data (e.g., eukaryotes). • Use spreadsheet software to format the data file into a format compatible with MicrobiomeAnalyst (Dhariwal et al., 2017; Chong et al., 2020) . • Use MicrobiomeAnalyst to perform data normalization and analysis.
