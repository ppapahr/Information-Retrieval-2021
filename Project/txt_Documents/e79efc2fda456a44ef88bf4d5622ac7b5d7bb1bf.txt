We have read with great interest the original and interesting paper by Kilic and colleagues (Kilic et al, 2020) , concerning the possibility that sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) could be a nonspecific symptom of a SARS-CoV-2. Although we certainly consider it as a challenging study, we would like to comment on some aspects.

SNNHL has multiple etiologies, such as vascular, viral and autoimmune, and its incidence is
