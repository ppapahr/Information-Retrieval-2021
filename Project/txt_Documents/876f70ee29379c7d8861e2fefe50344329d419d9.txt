22 Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute 23 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although unprecedented efforts 24 are underway to develop therapeutic strategies against this disease, scientists have 25 acquired only a little knowledge regarding the structures and functions of the CoV 26 replication and transcription complex (RTC) and 16 non-structural proteins, named 27 NSP1-16. 28 Results: In the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of 29 NSP12-16 in the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV 30 RTC functions in the "leader-to-body fusion" process. More importantly, our results 31 revealed the associations between multiple functions of the RTC, including RNA 32 synthesis, NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation, and CoV replication and transcription 33 at the molecular level. As the most important finding, transcription regulatory 34 sequence (TRS) hairpins were reported for the first time to help understand the 35 multiple functions of CoV RTCs and the strong recombination abilities of CoVs. 36 Conclusions: TRS hairpins can be used to identify recombination regions in CoV 37 genomes. We provide a systematic understanding of the structures and functions of 38 the RTC, leading to the eventual determination of the global CoV RTC structure. Our 39 findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its 40 regulation, providing a basis for future studies. Future drug design targeting 41 SARS-CoV-2 needs to consider protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the 42 RTC, particularly the complex structure of NSP15 and NSP16 with the TRS hairpin. 43 44 45 Keyword: coronavirus; RNA methylation; NSP12; NSP15; NSP16 46 47
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory 49 In our previous study, we provided a molecular basis to explain the 75 "leader-to-body fusion" model by identifying the cleavage sites of NSP15 and 76 proposed a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of CoV replication and 77 transcription. In the present study, we aimed to determine the theoretical arrangement 78 of NSP12-16 in the global structure of the CoV RTC by comprehensive analysis of 79 data from different sources, and to elucidate the functions of CoV RTC in the 80 "leader-to-body fusion" process. 81 82 Here, we provide a brief introduction to the "leader-to-body fusion" model 85 proposed in an early study [9] and its molecular basis proposed in our recent study 86 [11] . CoV replication and transcription require gRNAs(+) as templates for the 87 synthesis of antisense genomic RNAs [gRNAs(-)] and antisense subgenomic RNAs 88 [sgRNAs(-)] by RdRP. When RdRP pauses, as it crosses a body transcription 89 regulatory sequence (TRS-B) and switches the template to the leader TRS (TRS-L), 90 sgRNAs(-) are formed through discontinuous transcription (also referred to as 91 polymerase jumping or template switching). Otherwise, RdRP reads gRNAs(+) 92 continuously, without interruption, resulting in gRNAs(-). Thereafter, gRNAs(-) and 93 sgRNAs(-) are used as templates to synthesize gRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(+), 94 respectively; gRNAs(+) and sgRNAs(+) are used as templates for the translation of 95 NSP1-16 and 10 other proteins (S, E, M, N, and ORF3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10), 96 respectively. The molecular basis of the "leader-to-body fusion" model as proposed in 97 our previous study is that NSP15 cleaves gRNAs(-) and sgRNAs(-) at TRS-Bs(-). 98 Then, the free 3' ends (~6 nt) of TRS-Bs(-) hybridize the junction regions of TRS-Ls 99 for template switching. NSP15 may also cleave gRNAs(-) and sgRNAs(-) at 100 TRS-Ls(-), which is not necessary for template switching. This molecular basis preliminarily answered how the RTC functions in the "leader-to-body fusion" 102 process. However, the associations between NSP12, NSP15 and other 14 NSPs are 103 still unknown. 104 105 NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation and 3' polyadenylation 106 The cleavage sites of NSP15 contain the canonical TRS motif "GTTCGT" [11] , 107 read on the antisense strands of CoV genomes. One study reported that RNA 108 methylation sites contain the "AAGAA-like" motif (including AAGAA and other 109 A/G-rich sequences) throughout the viral genome, particularly enriched in genomic 110 positions 28,500-29,500 [4]. Nanopore RNA-seq, a direct RNA sequencing method 111 [12], was used in the study that shares data for our reanalysis in the previous [11] and 112 present studies. By reanalysing the Nanopore RNA-seq data [4], we found that the 113 "AAGAA-like" motif co-occurred with the canonical TRS motif "GTTCGT" ( In the present study, we defined the hairpins containing the canonical and 121 non-canonical TRS motif as canonical and non-canonical TRS hairpins, respectively. 122 In addition, we defined the hairpins opposite to the TRS hairpins as opposite TRS 123 hairpins ( Figure 1A) . As the global structure of CoV RTC is asymmetric (Figure 1B) , 124 opposite TRS hairpins may not be present. All the complemented palindrome 125 sequences in TRS hairpins are semipalindromic or heteropalindromic. By analysing 126 the junction regions between TRS-Bs and the TRS-L of SARS-CoV-2, we found that 127 NSP15 cleaves the canonical TRS hairpin of ORF3a at an unexpected breakpoint 128 "GTTCGTTTAT|N" (the vertical line indicates the breakpoint and N indicates any 129 nucleotide base), rather than the end of the canonical TRS motif "GTTCGT|TTATN". 130 Here, we defined the breakpoints "GTTCGT|TTATN" and "GTTCGTTTAT|N" as 131 canonical and non-canonical TRS breakpoints, respectively. The discovery of this 132 non-canonical TRS breakpoint indicated that the recognition of NSP15 cleavage sites 133 is structure-based rather than sequence-based. In addition, we found non-canonical 134 TRS hairpins in many non-canonical junction regions [11] . Thus, we proposed a 135 hypothesis that CoV recombinant events occurred due to the cleavage of 136 non-canonical TRS hairpins. Then, we validated that non-canonical TRS hairpins are 137 present in 7 recombination regions that in the ORF1a, S and ORF8 genes, using 292 138 genomes of betacoronavirus subgroup B, in our previous study [14] . Non-canonical 139 TRS hairpins are also present in 5 typical recombination regions (Figure 2) analyzed 140 in our previous study [11] . Therefore, TRS hairpins can be used to identify 141 recombination regions in CoV genomes. 142 Another important phenomenon reported in the previous study [4] that merits 143 further analysis was that the "AAGAA-like" motif associates with the 3' poly(A) 144 lengths of gRNAs and sgRNAs. However, the study did not investigate the 145 association between the "AAGAA-like" motif and the nascent RNAs cleaved by 146 NSP15. The methylation at the "AAGAA-like" motif (read on the antisense strands of 147 CoV genomes) in TRS hairpins may affect the downstream 3' polyadenylation that 148 prevents the quick degradation of nascent RNAs (Figure 1B) . Although the type of 149 methylation is unknown, a preliminary study was conducted, which revealed that 150 modified RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 have shorter 3' poly(A) tails than unmodified ones 151 [4]. However, there are two shortcomings in the interpretation of CoV RNA 152 methylation in this previous study: (1) it was not explained that many methylation 153 sites are far from 3' ends, which are unlikely to contributes to the3' poly(A) tails; and 154 (2) the "AAGAA-like" motif on the antisense strand was not analyzed (See below), as 155 only a few antisense reads were obtained using Nanopore RNA-seq. Although the 156 associations between NSP15 cleavage, RNA methylation and 3' polyadenylation are still unclear, they suggest that the RTC has a local structure composed of NSP15 and 158 16 to contain a TRS hairpin. This special local structure is able to facilitate the NSP15 159 cleavage and RNA methylation of the TRS hairpin at the opposite sides ( Figure 1B) .  In the present study, we determined the theoretical arrangement of NSP12-16 in 213 the global RTC structure. This arrangement answered how the CoV RTC functions in 214 the "leader-to-body fusion" process. Our model did not rule out the involvement of 215 other proteins (e.g., NSP7) in the global RTC structure or the "leader-to-body fusion" 216 process. More importantly, our results revealed the associations between multiple 217
