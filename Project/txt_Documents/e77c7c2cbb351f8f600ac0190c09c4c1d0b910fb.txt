consultants during tracheostomy; the procedures were performed by expert surgeons to guarantee fast and effective tracheostomy and to avoid long infection exposure. In this scenario, we are facing a double challenge: on one hand, we are forging our character and improving our skills during this pandemic. On the other hand, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergencies and oncology patients 6 , with a substantial decrease in the residents' involvement in the surgical theater, so we are not able to quantify the short-term and the long-term implications of these changes. In the absence/reduction of hands-on surgical experience, we should consider newly available options for trainees, also considering the need to respect social distancing. While we understand the importance of in-person patient experience, we should consider the opportunity of virtual education and telemedicine; due to the impossibility to participate in lectures, we strongly believe that departments should organize online lessons and virtual academic conferences 7 . In this view, a simple idea could be to develop teaching contexts in telemedicine, dealing contracts with companies that provide online courses and distance learning. We also recommend viewing high-quality surgical videos to help make up for the significant loss of time in the operating room. In addition, to bridge the surgical gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to not limit surgical training to oncological patients and trauma emergencies, I suggest a greater involvement of residents in the operating room. I would also like to emphasize the importance, for a University with surgical residencies, the presence of a permanent anatomical dissection laboratory, which allows residents to improve their surgical skills and to learn new techniques; the dissection time can be also considered as a moment of sharing between residents and tutors6. Although no one can now quantify how much our surgical education will be compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe that this unprecedented circumstance will change the way we will be educated. I am optimistic that future otolaryngology residents will benefit from these changes, and I am sure that those of us training during this pandemic are deeply changed and grow in our role as physicians and future leaders.
