The trajectory of immunological and inflammatory changes following acute COVID-19 infection 33 are unclear. We investigate immunological changes in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate 34 their potential relationships with persistent symptoms, termed long COVID. 35 We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence 36 (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days 37 convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise 38 tolerance were assessed and investigated their relationship with convalescent results. 39 We demonstrate persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ 40 and CD8+ T cells, and reduced na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells 41 remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced na?ve CD4+ and 42 CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced 43 exercise tolerance were common but were not associated with immunological changes. : medRxiv preprint 91 Cohort two was also predominantly healthcare workers. In cohort two, 47 had mild, 18 had 92 moderate, and 6 had severe acute COVID. All patients had lymphoid and myeloid 93 immunophenotyping and detailed clinical and health assessments performed at outpatient 94 appointment. The combined sample consists of both cohort one and cohort two. Detailed 95 characteristics of cohort one, cohort two and the combined samples are presented in Table 1 . 96 97 .

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is responsible for the largest global pandemic in 47 modern medicine (1). The features of acute illness are well-described, ranging from disturbance 48 in smell and mild coryzal symptoms to acute respiratory failure and the need for invasive 49 mechanical ventilation (2, 3). Age is strongly associated with disease severity, with older 50 individuals suffering poorer outcomes (4, 5). The immunological changes associated with severe 51 disease are also known, with increased inflammatory proteins, coagulopathy and changes in 52 myeloid cell populations reported (6, 7). In particular, severe COVID-19 is characterised by 53 expansion of immature myeloid populations, with loss of HLA-DR expression by monocytes and 54 loss of CD10 expression on neutrophils (8, 9) . Panlymphopenia is also prominent, with CD4+ T 55 cells particularly affected (10, 11) . 56 In contrast to the well-characterised inflammatory and immunological signature of acute disease, 57 relatively little is known about resolution of inflammatory markers and immune cell population 58 changes during the convalescent period. These gaps in current knowledge of convalescence are 59 of immediate importance, with the emergence of prolonged symptoms following resolution of 60 acute infection, termed long COVID (12). The immunological features of this syndrome are only 61 being described at present, with short-term follow up (less than one month) of non-hospitalised 62 patients showing expansion of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (13). Despite the 63 importance of this issue towards understanding the long-term consequences of COVID-19, 64 further insight into how long such changes persist, and the contribution of immune responses to The clinical characteristics of long COVID are protean and an agreed definition has yet to be 67 found; the most common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath and reduced exercise 68 tolerance (14, 15) . The possible mechanisms for post-COVID fatigue and breathlessness have 69 been speculated to be associated with deconditioning, as well as hypothesised to be due to 70 persistent inflammation or immune activation (16). However, these connections remain 71 unexplored. 72 We hypothesised that, given the strong association between the immune response and severity 73 of acute COVID-19 infection, there may be persistent and chronic changes to the immune system 74 which may be linked to the long-term effects of COVID-19. Our goal was to determine if persistent 75 inflammatory and immune cell dysregulation was evident in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 76 infection. We further investigated the factors that might be associated with potential persistent 77 immune dysregulation and to interrogate the relationship between these measures and physical 78 ill-health post-COVID-19. 79 80 .

We recruited three cohorts for this study. Cohort one comprised of forty participants 84 (aged 51.4 ± 16.9 years, 52.5% female) recruited for matched longitudinal blood sampling and 85 immunophenotyping at (i) time of initial COVID-19 disease and (ii) ten-week follow-up (median: Cohort three comprised of forty healthy pre-pandemic controls (aged 47.3 ± 15.3 years; 55% 101 female) and was used for comparison of extended T cell immunophenotyping parameters, with 102 20 of these also having myeloid immunophenotyping performed. There were no age/sex 103 differences between controls and cohort one (t = 0.9, p = 0.35; ÷ 2 = 2.5, p = 0.11 respectively) or 104 cohort two (t = 1.1, p = 0.27; ÷ 2 = 0.05, p = 0.82 respectively). 105 Persistent ill-health evident at 82 days following COVID-19 106 We first investigated the prevalence of the cardinal features of long COVID in our cohort. All 107 participants were assessed for ongoing ill-health, fatigue and exercise tolerance at time of 108 convalescent immunophenotyping (median 82 days, IQR 67 -112). Most patients (71/111, 64%) 109 reported that they did not feel back to full health, while 61 (55%) met the case definition for 110 fatigue. The median fatigue score for the cohort as a whole was 15 , while the 111 median fatigue score of those who met the case definition for fatigue was 20 (IQR 17 -23) (Table   112 1). Two-thirds of participants (76/111; 68.4%) underwent a six-minute-walk test (6MWT). The 113 median distance covered was 475m . The median maximal Modified Borg 114 Dyspnoea Scale (MBS) score reported was 3 (IQR 2 -5). The median distance covered by 115 convalescent individuals was lower than that seen in healthy populations, but higher than that 116 reported in post-ARDS patients (17, 18) . These findings demonstrate that the primary features of 117 long COVID are common in our convalescent cohort who attended for follow up appointment. 118 We therefore wanted to further investigate if there were further physiological changes, 119 particularly in relation to immunity, in COVID convalescence. 120 .

These changes in neutrophils had 145 resolved by ten weeks to a level comparable to that of healthy controls. While HLA-DR+ 146 monocytes increased at convalescence to levels of healthy controls, this increase was not 147 statistically significant; this likely reflects the mixed severities of the populations ( Figure 2C ).

As expected, acute SARS-CoV-2 164 infection was associated with striking lymphopenia (Figure 3B ). We found a significant reduction 165 in the total number of immune (CD45+) cells, total lymphocytes (CD3+), CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T 166 cells in comparison to healthy controls (n=40). Despite this significant lymphopenia during acute 167 COVID-19 infection, at ten weeks post-COVID all of these counts had significantly recovered and 168 were similar to those of control participants (Figures 3A-3D) . 169 On more detailed T cell immunophenotyping, we found that acute infection was associated with 170 a significant reduction in absolute na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and increased activated 171 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in comparison to controls. Over the course of ten weeks, whilst 172 na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts had partially recovered, they remained significantly lower than 173 the levels of healthy controls (Figures 3E, 3F) . Numbers of effector CD8+ T cells remained 174 expanded over the course of COVID-19 recovery and counts were significantly greater than 175 healthy controls at ten-week follow-up ( Figure 3G ). One of the most notable differences was that 176 activated T cell numbers did not significantly change with resolution of illness; there were 177 significantly higher numbers of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients ten weeks post-COVID 178 compared to healthy controls (Figures 3H, 3I) . Interestingly, there was no association between 179 convalescent lymphocyte subset counts and severity of initial infection (na?ve CD4+ T cells 180 ÷ 2 =0.31, p=0.86, na?ve CD8+ T cells ÷ 2 =4.12, p=0.13, effector CD8+ T cells ÷ 2 =0.29, p=0.19, 181 activated CD4+ T cells ÷ 2 =0.28, p=0.87, activated CD8+ T cells ÷ 2 =0.29, p=0.07). .

Twenty patients (20/111, 18%) had an elevated D-dimer at time of 224 assessment. D-dimer levels were negatively associated with the proportion of naive CD8+ T cells 225 ( Figure 5A ), while they were positively associated with activated CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5B ) and 226 activated CD8+ T cells ( Figure 5C ). However, there was no relationship between D-dimer levels 227 and na?ve CD4+ T cells (r 2 =-0.15, p=0.13) or effector CD8+ T cells (r 2 =0.12, p=0.24). 228 229 .

As we had noted interesting lymphocyte 237 abnormalities post-COVID, we further investigated if age influences any of the dynamic changes 238 T cell responses seen in convalescence. We stratified our convalescent patients into 20-year age 239 brackets: 20 -39 (n=43), 40 -59 (n=49) and 60 -80 (n=19). There was no difference in time to 240 follow up between the three age groups (z=1.5, p=0.47). The older 60 -80 cohort were more 241 likely to have been admitted during acute infection than the youngest (z=4.62, p=<0.001) and 40 242 -59 (z=2.77, p=0.02) cohorts.

It is a single-centre study at a single medium-term 377 interval. However, we have two separate convalescent time points, in addition to data from acute 378 illness. This allows a disease and recovery trajectory to be plotted. We have loss to follow-up, 379 with 31% of patients attending their outpatient appointments. This is a common challenge seen 380 in research conducted in clinical ambulatory care settings. However, our cohort may have an 381 increased burden of symptoms following COVID-19 than that seen in the entire affected 382 population. 383 The results reported here provide insights into the immune consequences of SARS-CoV-2 384 infection, as well as the age effects on immune recovery. It provides possible mechanisms for 385 immunopathology and should inform the design of ongoing studies into the immunological 386 consequences of COVID-19 and associations with long COVID clinical features. .

Encouragingly, 389 our matched longitudinal patient data shows that all cell counts return towards levels of healthy 390 controls. Although there are persistent lymphocyte and monocyte abnormalities at 68 days, 391 these had resolved by 101 days post infection with the exception of a persistent expansion of 392 activated CD8+ T cells. We show that age, while being strongly associated with poor outcome in 393 acute COVID, is also strongly associated with impaired immunological recovery in convalescence. 394 The association of D-dimer levels with activated lymphocytes provide a potential basis for 395 persistent immune dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While we demonstrate the 396 burden of persistent ill-health following SARS-CoV-2 infection, this was not associated with 397 immunological changes. 398 399 .
