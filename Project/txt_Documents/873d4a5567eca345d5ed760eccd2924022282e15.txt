559 560 Supplemental Figure 1. Single-cell RNA sequencing reanalyses of ACE2 transcript abundance 561 in lung parenchyma (23). Summative observations from all donors. a) Uniform manifold 562 approximation and projection (UMAP) visualizations. Cells were clustered using a shared 563 nearest neighbor (SNN) approach. Cell types associated with each cluster were identified by 564 determining marker genes for each cluster. Each data point denotes a cell. On the right panel, 565 cells with ACE2 transcripts are shown in red. b) Violin plots representing ACE2 expression in 566 the alveoli. Airway cells (basal, mitotic, ciliated, club) are not shown. Percentage of ACE2 + cells 567 within each cell type shows ACE2 transcripts in 1.2% of alveolar type II cells and in 0.1% of 568 macrophages, monocytes, or dendritic cells. Each data point denotes a cell, most cells have no 569 expression (0). AT2: alveolar type II. AT1: alveolar type I. Macs: Macrophages. Mono: 570 Monocytes. DC: dendritic cells. Other immune cells: B cells, mast cells, natural killer/T cells.
