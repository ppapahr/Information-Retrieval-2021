medRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 infections through comparison to patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical 75 measurements, and longitudinal samples taken from individuals over the course of disease 76 progression. Lastly, we validated that the same biomarkers appeared in an established hamster 77 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chan et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Mu?oz-Fontela et al., 78 2020).
There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-23 threatening illness so that scarce medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid 24 treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most 25 effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we performed untargeted 26 metabolomics profiling of 341 patients with plasma samples collected at six longitudinal time 27 points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we then built a predictive 28 model of disease severity. We determined that the levels of 25 metabolites measured at the time 29 of hospital admission successfully predict future disease severity. Through analysis of 30 longitudinal samples, we confirmed that these prognostic markers are directly related to disease 31 progression and that their levels are restored to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we 32 validated that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19. Our results 33 indicate that metabolic changes associated with COVID-19 severity can be effectively used to 34 stratify patients and inform resource allocation during the pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus 37 SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis (Wu et al., 2020b) . As of January 2021, more than 38 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and resulted in over 2.1 million 39 deaths (2020d). The infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced with the appropriate 40 care (e.g., intensive care unit beds, staff, extracorporeal life support, and therapeutics). Such 41 resources are limited, however, and with fewer than five million individuals in the United States 42 fully vaccinated, they continue to be in high demand (2020d). In the United States, one out of 43 five hospitals with an intensive care unit (ICU) has at least 95% of their ICU beds full (Conlen 44 F., 2021) and fewer than 150,000 patient courses of casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal 45 antibodies have been distributed (2020c). Availability of bamlanivimab, the only other 46 monoclonal antibody that currently has emergency use authorization, has been similarly limited 47 (2020b). 48 To reduce mortality, patients who develop critical illness from COVID-19 must be treated 49 early in the disease course before the onset of severe symptoms (Kim et al., 2020) . 50 Unfortunately, COVID-19 progresses rapidly and it is currently difficult to determine which 51 subset of infected patients will develop life-threatening disease (Kattan et al., 2020) . If these 52 patients could be identified, however, then the limited amount of resources available could be 53 optimally allocated to save the greatest number of lives. To this end, the objective of the current 54 study was to identify metabolites in patient plasma that accurately predict life-threatening cases 55 of COVID-19 prior to the onset of severe symptoms. Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma) was measured repeatedly as a quality control (QC) and Figure S2c but no longer clustered based on batch ( Figure S2d ). The goal of this study was to find metabolic alterations that are predictive of disease severity 152 in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. We used admission to the ICU during disease progression 153 to classify patients as having severe or non-severe disease, as has been done previously 154 (Arunachalam et al., 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020 ). An ideal biomarker panel would allow an 155 individual presenting at the hospital and receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR-test result to be 156 screened for metabolic markers associated with severe disease progression to guide the best 157 treatment at the earliest stage of hospitalization. Thus, we grouped the presented COV+ cohort 158 into a non-severe (COV+ non-severe) group that did not require ICU admission and a severe 159 group (COV+ severe) that did require ICU admission. For data interpretation purposes, two 160 study samples were excluded due to a missing SARS-CoV-2-PCR-test result, one sample due to CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Further, several polar metabolites known to 172 be related to COVID-19 including gluconate (Song et al., 2020) and dimethylguanosine (Migaud 173 et al., 2020) were also significantly altered (Figure 1b) .

This indicates that the model can not only 211 differentiate disease severity but also can distinguish COV+ and COV-patients. We wish to 212 emphasize that PCR is the gold standard to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, we 213 present this result only as confirmation that our model correctly predicts disease severity and not 214 as a diagnostic for viral infection. .

We examined whether these 257 metabolites were reflective of an underlying condition, risk factor for severe disease, or related to Table 2 ). The COV+ severe group is 262 significantly biased towards patients with advanced age, however, the age ranges in both groups 263 are comparable (Figure 3a ). There was no significant difference in BMI (Figure 3b ), but we note 264 that there was variability in BMI for both patient groups.

Further, we wished to compare the end points in these groups to the COV-d0 patients. 347 We constructed representative metabolite profiles for the groups by using the 25 predictor 348 metabolites at each of the study time points (d0, d3, d7, d14, d28, and d84) and performed a 349 principal component analysis that enabled the trajectory of each group to be drawn out in two 350 dimensions (Figure 4b) .

In the COV+ severe group, the LPC levels increased over the 383 course of 84 days to levels that are comparable to the COV-group (FC=1, Figure 5a ). In the 384 COV+ non-severe group, the LPC levels recovered faster, and, at day 28, an overcompensation 385 occurred resulting in higher LPC levels than in the COV-group (FC=1, Figure 5b ).

Although these studies found higher AUC scores than that 484 of our model, they used considerably smaller patient cohorts than what our model was trained 485 and evaluated on. When we tested non-linear models (RF and SVM), we found worse cross-486 validated performance than ElasticNet (see Figure S3a ). Another challenge we faced in building 487 a model of disease severity is that the size of our study required normalizing metabolic profiles 488 acquired in multiple batches. We demonstrated that ComBat normalization was able to remove 489 the variance resulting from these batch effects. In removing this variance, however, true 490 biological variation was undoubtedly removed. Despite these limitations, our model still 491 accurately predicted patient disease severity. Interpretation of our model led us to identify 25 robust predictor metabolites whose identities 493 were rigorously confirmed. Using this reduced predictor set, we were able to retrain our model CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
