Distribution of Incubation Period of COVID-19 in the Canadian Context: Modeling and Computational Study
Subhendu Paul, Emmanuel Lorin
We propose an original model based on a set of coupled delay differential equations with fourteen delays in order to accurately estimate the incubation period of COVID-19, employing publicly available data of confirmed corona cases. In this goal, we separate the total cases into fourteen groups for the corresponding fourteen incubation periods. The estimated mean incubation period we obtain is 6.74 days (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 6.35 to 7.13), and the 90th percentile is 11.64 days (95% CI: 11.22 to 12.17), corresponding to a good agreement with statistical supported studies. This model provides an almost zero-cost approach to estimate the incubation period. : medRxiv preprint NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice. cer etc., and older people are vulnerable to severe complications and death from coronavirus, although we are discovering new features of COVID-19 every day. In the absence of vaccination and proper medication, we can merely obey some non-pharmaceutical containments, lockdown, social distancing, hand hygiene, face masking, mobile app to trace corona-positive individuals, to help prevent the spread of the this infectious disease. To minimize transmission of the virus through human-to-human interaction, quarantine of individuals with exposure to infectious pathogen is an effective strategy for containing contagious diseases. To govern a quarantine period for asymptomatic as well as presymptomatic individuals, it is essential to fully estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 disease.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , first appeared in Wuhan (China) and spread around the world (20) , and is creating dramatic and daily changes with profound impacts worldwide. People with underlying medical condition, respiratory disease, diabetes, can-1 comprising fourteen delays, to estimate the incubation period utilizing publicly available data of the total number of corona-positive cases. This approach is free from any special type of samples in order to produce the distribution of the incubation period. It is then almost cost free, as it only involves a small scale computations. After a single calculation employing this method, we can generate the current distribution as well as previous distributions of the incubation period. We can also observe the change in the incubation period. In the statistical based approach, it is usually difficult to consider a large incubation period if the sample size is small. However, in this approach, we can go well beyond 14 days, the incubation period we have set for the current work. In this context, we demonstrate the incubation period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada employing publicly available data of confirmed corona-positive cases (1) . As of November 7, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had confirmed a total of 251,338 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 10,381 deaths (20) . There are several studies on incubation period mainly based on Chinese patients that can only provide a rough estimation for rest of the world. The incubation period may depends on age (25) (median-age / country), hard immunity, public health system, corona testing capacities, daily corona cases, etc. For a better estimation of the incubation period for a particular region, we need to study local patients. Data collection is a bottleneck in studying the incubation period. However, one can easily estimate the incubation period using the approach we propose and publicly available data of confirmed cases. In this section, we introduce a compartment based infectious disease model including a total of seventeen partitions, Lockdown, Susceptible, Infected and fourteen compartments of Total confirmed cases (LSIT). The model is constructed as a set of coupled delay differential equations involving several variables and parameters. .

By estimating important epidemiological parameters using the available database, we can make forecasts of different intervention scenarios. In the context of compartment based model, where the population of a region is distributed into several population groups, such as susceptible, infected, total cases etc., is a simple but useful tool to demonstrate the panorama of an epidemics. In this article, we introduce a infectious disease model, extending the standard SIR model, including the phenomenon lockdown, a non-pharmaceutical way to prevent the spread of the epidemics. The schematic diagram of the model is presented in Fig. S1 with several compartments and various model parameters. The following are the underlying principles of the present model. • The total population is constant (neglecting the migrations, births and unrelated deaths) and initially every individual is assumed susceptible to contract the disease. • The disease is spread through the direct (face-to-face meeting) or indirect (through air current, common used or delivery items like door handles, grocery products) contact of susceptible individuals with the infective individuals. • The quarantined area or the compartment for corona cases contains only members of the infected population who are tested corona-positive. • The virus always kills some percent of the people it infects; the survivors percent represents the recovered group. • There is a non-pharmaceutical policy (stay at home), commonly known as lockdown, to stop the spread of the disease. .

The goal of the present model is to estimate the distribution of the incubation period of COVID-19. In this goal, we split the compartment T into J subcomponents T 1 , · · · , T J , where (1) In Eqn. 1, k represents the time index and T (k) i represents the total corona-positive cases corresponding the incubation period ô i , presented in Fig. S1 . The time-dependent model is the following set of coupled delay differential equations: where á(t), â(t), ä i (t), for i = 1, · · · , J and í(t) are real positive parameters respectively modeling the rate of lockdown, the rate of infection, the rate of tested corona-positive corresponding the incubation period ô i and the rate of ignoring lockdown, respectively. It follows from Eqn. 2, that for any t where N (constant) is the total population size. .

To solve the initial value problem Eqn. 2, in the interval [t 0 , t 1 ], we consider L(t 0 ), S(t 0 ), I(t 0 ) and T (t 0 ) as follows: where T (t 0 ) is the available data at time t 0 , and q is the initial value adjusting parameters. Initially, there is no lockdown individual so that we can consider L(t 0 ) = 0. We focus on the exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada; one can use the approach to estimate the incubation period distribution for any region affected by the infectious disease. The time resolved (daily updated) database (1) provides the number of total corona-positive cases. The optimal values of p(t) = (q, á(t), â(t), ä 1 (t), · · · , ä J (t), í) T , that is the set of initial values and model parameters, is obtained by minimizing the root mean square error function E(p(t)), defined as where T (k) is the available data of total corona-positive cases on the particular kth day, and  In this section, we propose a detailed description of the computational procedure for the proposed model.

It is believed this is the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in Canada, and according to the government report, the novel coronavirus arrived on the Canadian coast on January 25, 2020, first reported case. The above information suggests that the start date of the current pandemic in Canada is possibly xsto be January 22, 2020. Additionally, some research studies reported that the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 is from 2 to 14 days (2, 20). As a consequence, in the present study we consider 14 delays, ô 1 = 1 day, ô 2 = 2 days, · · ·, ô 14 = 14 days. Here we consider a calculation of 276 days, from January 22, 2020 to October 23, 2020. We decompose the time domain of 276 days into two parts : the time domain splitter is in the interval where the first wave is slowed down and the "second wave" begins, i.e. the splitter is in the interphase of two different scenarios. In this goal, we can choose the parameters p(t) as p(t) = p (1) from January 22, 2020 to July 19, 2020 , p(t) = p (2) from July 20, 2020 to October 23, 2020 , where 14 , í (1) ) T and p (2) = (á (2) , â (2) , ä 1 , · · · , ä (2) 14 , í (2) ) T are some constants. The capability of an optimization package depends on the initial values of the parameters: for q, á, â, í we consider any positive random number less than unity, where as a choice of x = (ä 1 , · · · , ä 14 ) T is tricky. For this purpose, we consider a vector of 14 positive random numbers x such that ä 1 < · · · < ä 4 > ä 5 > ä 6 > · · · > ä 14 and 14 i=1 ä i = 0.9. We observe, from numerous numerical experiments, the renormalization factor 0.9 works perfectly for the computation. For a complete calculation, we run the matlab code twice. Firstly, we run the code for the period January 22, 2020 to July 19, 2020 to obtain the estimated value p (1) est of p (1) , presented in Table S1 , and the value of the error function E(p Table S1 , and the value of the error function E(p  where M 1 corresponds the date July 19, 2020. After estimating the model parameters with sufficiently small values of the error functions, we compare in Fig. 1 total corona cases calculated with our model and the available data (1). This 8 .

In Fig. 2 , the confirmed cases 211,735 of 276 days are divided into fourteen groups. The ith compartment T i , defined in Eqn. 1, is the confirmed cases of 276 days corresponding to the incubation period of i day(s) for i = 1, 2, · · ·, 14. In addition T i is the frequency of the incubation period of i day(s), and using the bar chat, we obtain a mean incubation period of 6.89 days, a median of the incubation period of 6 days, 90th percentile of 11 days, 95th percentile of 12 days and 99th percentile of 13.5 days. The bar chat shows that mode of the incubation period is of 6 days, and there is a second peak for the incubation period at 10 days. However, the second peak is strongly dominated by the first. From the bar chat presented in Fig. 2 , we can also obtain the probability densities of incubation period of the first k days during the epidemic, thanks to the total confirmed cases of the first k days starting on January 22, 2020.

The estimated incubation period, obtained using lognormal distribution, has a mean of 6.74 (95% CI: 6.35 to 7.13), and the 90th percentile is 11.64 days (95% CI : 11.22 to 12.17).

Fig. 5 shows the lognormal distribution of 276th day along withp  The calculated mean incubation period using two different ways, the raw data as well as the lognormal distribution are indeed closed, indicating that the raw data calculated using our mathematical model, are statistically significant for a lognormal distribution (statistical p value less than 0.001). It follows from the "Math.-Model" calculation, presented in Table 1 , that the mean incubation period of 276th day, population size 2258, is greater than the mean incubation period of 276 days, population size 221,735 which demonstrates that the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is slightly increasing with time. In this paper, we have derived a mathematical model based on a set of coupled delay differential equations, which was used to estimate the incubation period with good agreement with statistical works. Using the proposed model and publicly available data of confirmed cases, one could accurately estimate the incubation period in any region. We obtain the distribution of the incubation period from the population, so that it is better than any sample-dependent result. We have considered fourteen delays, but it is possible to consider an arbitrary number of delays. After estimating the model parameters, one can estimate the incubation period of confirmed cases over a long period, over a small time interval, and even over a single day. The present approach 15 .
