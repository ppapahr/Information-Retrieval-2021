For all reported potential donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, CDC, OPO, or transplant center staff reviewed medical records of donors and recipients, including SARS-CoV-2 testing and chest imaging reports. The donor clinical history was reviewed to look for evidence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath. OPO staff asked donor next of kin if the donor had been exposed to someone who had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Additional information included whether the donor had contact with any sick persons or any travel in the 2 weeks prior to death. Recipients who initially tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and triggered a notification to the OPTN of a potential donor-derived transmission were referred to as index recipients, and recipients who shared a common donor with index recipients are referred to as co-recipients. CDC investigators asked OPO and index recipient hospital staff if nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had occurred in donor or recipient hospitals. CDC investigators collected information from transplant centers and OPOs about potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for index recipients during the 14 days before symptom onset, including contact with persons with fever or respiratory symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, travel, and hospitalization prior to admission for the transplant procedure. Confirmed exposure was defined as reported contact (e.g., living with a person or being treated by a healthcare worker) with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the infectious period (1) . Potential healthcare exposure was defined as treatment in a healthcare facility with known or suspected nosocomial transmission without a confirmed contact. Potential community exposure was defined as contact with a person meeting a probable COVID-19 case definition (2) . Transplant hospital providers monitored organ recipients for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, sore throat, headache, congestion, and other concerning symptoms) for >14 days following the transplant. Some asymptomatic recipients, depending on hospital capacity, and recipients who developed symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a nucleic acid test (NAT) on a nasopharyngeal specimen. Because donor respiratory specimens (e.g., sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal swab) were only available for 1 donor, donor serum (which is archived per routine OPO practice) was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by processing with the EZ1 nucleic acid extractor with the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (QIAGEN, https://www.qiagen.com) followed by real-time RT-PCR as previously described (3, 4) . For all donors included in this study, the cause of death was determined to be a noninfectious etiology, including stroke, opioid overdose, and head trauma. Next of kin of the 8 organ donors reported that none of the donors had symptoms of COVID-19 or contact with persons known to have COVID-19. Donor chest imaging reports documented infiltrates in 7 (88%) donors. For 4 of those 7 (57%) donors, OPO or the lung transplant center medical staff determined the chest imaging results to be unremarkable, and the lungs were transplanted. Lungs from 1 donor had evidence of trauma and were not transplanted. Due to abnormal chest imaging, lungs from 2 donors were not transplanted. One donor was screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a NAT on a respiratory specimen by the OPO prior to organ procurement and tested negative; the test was conducted using an in-house assay authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization. None of the 8 donor serum specimens had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. No donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 8 index recipients, 4 received lung, 2 received liver, and 2 received heart transplants ( Table 2) . Seven (88%) index recipients were male, and the median age of index recipients was 65 years (range 37-75 years); the median duration from organ transplantation to symptom onset was 9 days (range 6-81 days). Seven (88%) index recipients developed fever or lower respiratory tract symptoms. Seven index recipients required mechanical ventilation; 3 of those, 2 liver recipients and 1 lung recipient, died. Seven index recipients were given induction immunosuppressive therapy that included basiliximab, an interleukin-2 antagonist. All index recipients received investigational therapy for COVID-19. Treatment regimens included hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, intravenous immunoglobulin, or tocilizumab. All index recipients had potential or confirmed community or healthcare exposure to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Four (50%) index recipients had close contact with a healthcare worker with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. Two index recipients were hospitalized in facilities with potential nosocomial transmission. Two index recipients had contact with household members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Only 1 index recipient had a pretransplant specimen available for testing, and it tested negative by NAT for SARS-CoV-2. Detailed clinical reports of index recipients A and G have been published (5, 6) . From the 8 deceased donors, organs were transplanted into 31 recipients, including the 8 index recipients (Appendix Table) . Among the 23 co-recipients, 11 (48%) were tested for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; all tests used a NAT on a nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. Ten of these 11 co-recipients tested negative. One asymptomatic co-recipient was tested 41 days after transplant when she was admitted for a routine follow-up procedure and tested positive. None were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Within 14 days after transplant, 1 co-recipient experienced fever, 1 required additional oxygen, and 1 had diarrhea. All 3 of these recipients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three co-recipients experienced symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, or rhinorrhea, <14 days after transplant, but all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 testing was not performed on the other 12 co-recipients because these patients did not Page 4 of 5 have COVID-19 symptoms, and the transplant centers prioritized testing capacity for symptomatic patients. No co-recipients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
