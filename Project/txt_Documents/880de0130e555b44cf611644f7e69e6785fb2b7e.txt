The main model we use here corresponds to the one described in [1] but without explicitly including the population age structure; it is schematically represented in the figure below.
where is the transmission rate, 1/ # the time it takes for an exposed individual to become infectious (while still asymptomatic), 1/ $ + 1/ < = is the infectious period (so that E = ), ) is the probability of hospitalization given infection, and +,-the probability of hospitalized individuals to require intensive cares. Following [1] we set: 1/ # = 4 days, 1/ $ = 1 day, and 1/ < = 3 days, resulting in an incubation period of 5 days and in an infectious period of 4 days. The other parameters represent the flow between compartments for severely ill individuals: ) => (and ),+,-=> ) is the rate of hospital admissions for individuals not requiring intensive care (requiring intensive care), respectively, while +,-=> is the rate of ICU admissions; finally, 2/ ) ?@A is the time spent in the hospital general ward, and 2/ +,-?@A is the time spent in ICU. Following [1] we set 1/ ) => = 4 days. We fit our model to both admissions and number of occupied beds, so that the likelihood function is given by: where denotes the density of a Poisson distribution, is the time point, A and A are the number of hospital and ICU admissions, ),A and +,-,A are the number of occupied general ward and ICU beds, and the barred variables correspond to expected values obtained by solving the system of differential equations above. For one of our sensitivity analyses (see Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5 ), we included in the likelihood another Poisson term representing the contribution of the seroprevalence measured in [2] . More precisely, we added the term ( N | N ), with = July 17 (the mid-point of the seroprevalence study period), N the estimated number of seropositive individuals at time according to [2] , and N the expected number of seropositive individuals at time obtained from our model.
