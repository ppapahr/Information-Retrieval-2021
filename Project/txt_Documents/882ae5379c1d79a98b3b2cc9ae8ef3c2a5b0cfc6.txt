As pointed out by the authors of this and other reports, the primary concern with the use of baricitinib in COVID-19 patients is the potential for it to delay viral clearance and increase vulnerability to secondary nosocomial infections through its immunosuppressive properties. [1, 4] An adverse effect (AE) that has received less attention but that could be problematic for COVID-19 patients is baricitinib's dose-dependent association with arterial and venous thromboembolic events (VTE). [5, 6] In the present report, 2 patients, both of whom received baricitinib at a higher than US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved dose, experienced VTE. In pooled safety data from the baricitinib development program a total of 39 VTEs were reported among baricitinib-treated patients compared to zero with placebo [incidence rates 0.6/100 patient years (4mg/day) versus 0.4/100 patient years (2mg/day)]. [5] A safety signal for VTE was also identified in post-marketing surveillance data collected in the WHO's global database of individual case safety reports. [7] Thromboembolic events, coupled with other dose-related AEs, were partly responsible for baricitinib's failure to be granted marketing approval by the FDA in 2017. [5] The drug was approved in 2018 but only at 2mg/day and with, as pointed out by Titanji and colleagues, FDA warnings for infections, malignancy and thrombosis included in the prescribing information. [1, 5] Although the authors postulate that the short duration of baricitinib therapy may confer a lower risk of thromboembolic events, the relationship between duration of therapy and thromboembolism remains uncertain; it has been reported to occur within 6 weeks of therapy initiation in rheumatoid arthritis patients and up to one week following drug discontinuation. [5] A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 3 The mechanism responsible for thrombotic events is currently not known. Baricitinib has been associated with a rapid increase in platelet counts during the first 2 weeks of therapy. [5] This is believed to be related to reduced JAK2-mediated thrombopoietin clearance by megakaryocytes and mature platelets. [5] However, no clear temporal or quantitative association between increased platelet counts and thromboembolic events has been established. [5] An increased incidence of thromboembolic events was also reported with higher doses of tofacitinib, another JAK-inhibitor that does not increase platelets. [7] The immune, inflammatory and coagulation pathways are intimately intertwined and patients with COVID-19 appear to have an increased proclivity towards immunothrombosis. [6] Drugs like baricitinib, that target the hyperinflammatory immune response to infection that drives coagulopathy, could potentially decrease activation of the coagulation cascade and protect against thromboembolic events. However, it is also possible baricitinib's pro-thrombotic tendencies could exacerbate a hypercoagulable state. Balancing the potential risks and benefits of immunomodulatory therapies for patients with COVID-19 is challenging and the remaining uncertainties underscore the importance of restricting use to clinical trials.
