de la FA en esta poblaci?n. M?TODOS: an?lisis retrospectivo de una cohorte de 517 pacientes con infecci?n SARS-CoV-2 consecutivamente ingresados en un hospital terciario. Dividimos a los pacientes en dos grupos de acuerdo al desarrollo de FA durante el ingreso y comparamos las caracter?sticas de los grupos. Realizamos an?lisis univariado y multivariado de mortalidad. RESULTADOS: de los 517 pacientes, 54 (10.4%) desarrollaron FA. Estos pacientes son mayores (81.6 vs 66.5 a?os, p<0.001) y presentan m?s hipertensi?n (74% vs 47%, p<0.001), miocardiopat?a (9% vs 1%, p=0.002), ingreso previo por insuficiencia cardiaca (9% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), historia de FA (83% vs 1%, p<0.001) y mayor aur?cula izquierda (47.8 vs 39.9 mm, p<0.001). Los pacientes con FA presentan m?s fallo respiratorio agudo (72% vs 40%, p<0.001) y mayor mortalidad hospitalaria (50% vs 22%, p<0.001). Los predictores de FA son la edad y la historia de FA previa. La FA no es un predictor independiente de mortalidad hospitalaria. Los predictores son: edad, creatinina > 1.5 mg/dL al ingreso, LDH > 250 U/L al ingreso y el fallo respiratorio agudo. CONCLUSI?N: la FA aparece en el 10% de los pacientes hospitalizados por SARS-CoV-2. Estos presentan mayor comorbilidad y el doble de mortalidad hospitalaria, pero la FA no es un factor pron?stico independiente. CoV) presented mortality rates of 10% and 37% respectively. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in early December 2019 in Wuhan (Hubei, China) as a viral infection with pneumonia and respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 6 The spectrum of infection ranges from asymptomatic to critical forms. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Among hospitalized patients, the proportion of critical disease is higher, with nearly 30% of patients requiring intensive care. 14 Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities such us cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity or cancer… [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Other prognostic factors include acute respiratory failure or laboratory alterations as lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated inflammatory markers or acute kidney injury. 15, [20] [21] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrythmia worldwide, and it is expected to increase its incidence due to population aging and comorbidities. 22, 23 This arrythmia is common in the context of acute situations such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or infections, where it has linked with higher risk of complications and mortality. 24 7 Objective: we aimed to describe the clinical features and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and evaluate the impact of this arrythmia on the short-term prognosis of the disease.  We compare the main features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who develop AF during admission with the rest of patients and look for independent predictors of AF development. To evaluate the prognosis impact, we performed an univariable and multivariable analysis of in-hospital mortality, including the most important risk factors. We included patients older than 15 years old, admitted at a tertiary hospital between March 10 2020 and April 15, 2020, with definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only patients with a positive real time-polymerase chain reaction of nasal or pharyngeal swabs and lung damage demonstrated by chest imaging were admitted to the hospital (n=517). Otherwise they were given oral medical treatment and advised to come back to the hospital if symptoms worsen. Observational study with prospective recruitment of patients and retrospective data analysis including all patients with a final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 210 variables per patient were gathered in a specific database from consecutive patients with, which were retrospectively collected from the electronic medical records. Data encompassed a clinical history, temperature, blood pressure, symptoms, laboratory findings, ECG findings, chest imaging results, and events. All patients underwent at least one electrocardiogram at admission, and during hospitalization electrocardiograms were performed at medical discretion using either conventional machine or remote mobile transmission Alivecor Kardia monitor. (25) Laboratory parameters consisted of a complete blood count, coagulation testing including D-dimer, iron metabolism including ferritine, electrolytes, assessment of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin and creatine kinase. Troponin and interleukin-6 were obtained at the discretion of the physician. Fever was considered when temperature was over 37.5 o C. Respiratory failure was defined as pO2 less than 60 mmHg in arterial gasometry or O2 saturation measured with pulse oximetry of less than 90% breathing room air. Imaging always included a chest-X-ray and a CT scan when required. Interpretation was performed by an expert radiologist. To verify reliability of the gathered data 50 patients' records were reviewed by an independent observer and only 0.04% variables were found to be incorrect. Moreover, all quantitative outliers (more than mean±2SD) were checked by an independent observer. The study was approved by our local ethics committee. Categorical variables are reported as frequency (n) and percentages and continuous variables as mean value and standard deviation. Normal distribution of quantitative variables was verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visually through Q-Q plot graphics. Qualitative variables were compared with the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared with Student t test. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean age was 68.1 ± 15.1 years, with a high incidence of cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension 50%, hypercholesterolemia 36% and diabetes 18%). More frequent symptoms were cough (65%) and dyspnea (45%) followed by myalgias (19%) and diarrhea (26%). Most frequent laboratory abnormalities were the increase of CRP (87%), D Dimer (67%) and LDH (61%) as long as lymphopenia (49%). Acute respiratory failure appeared in 42% of patients, with 9% of ICU admission and 8% of mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality was 25%. During hospitalization, almost 90% of patients underwent the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with 57% of intravenous steroids and 63% of anticoagulation use. Among 517 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 54 (10.4%) developed AF during admission: 83% (n=45) have had previous AF episodes before and only 17% (n=9) presented "de novo" AF during hospitalization. Among 463 patients who did not develop AF during admission, only 3 (1%) have had previous AF episodes before.  Univariable analysis of in-hospital mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a linear relation between AF development and mortality (mortality on patients with AF 21% vs mortality on patients without AF 7%, p<0.001) (Supplementary Table 1 ). However, the multivariable analysis showed as independent predictors of mortality, age, creatinine at admission > 1.5 mg/dL, LDH at admission > 250 UI/L and acute respiratory failure (area under ROC curve 0.915, 95% CI 0.886-0.938) (Figure 1 ). AF development is not an independent predictor of mortality, its prognostic impact is totally influenced by its interaction with age, as presented in Table 2 . We present a work specifically addressing the influence of atrial fibrillation on SARS- with previous history of atrial fibrillation. 32 We included these patients, and demonstrated that previous AF is the most important predictor of AF development during admission. We could have found higher incidence of atrial fibrillation if continuous monitorization had been systemically performed, however, it was not contemplated in our protocol. AliveCor Kardia monitorization has demonstrated useful for AF screening in ambulatory patients and was acquired to improve arrythmia detection minimizing the risk of contagious. 25 Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and atrial fibrillation are older, and present higher incidence of arterial hypertension, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and of course, higher left atrium size. In our work, AF COVID-19 patients presented twice in-hospital mortality (50 vs 22%, p<0.001), however, AF is not an independent predictor of mortality, similarly to previous reports. 32 AF population has a two-fold increase in all-cause mortality, especially due to cardiovascular mortality. [33] [34] [35] [36] Several risk factors have been described, such as older age as long as underlying medical comorbidities such us cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity or cancer… [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] These risk factors are also important risk factors for AF development and are more frequent in our AF COVID-19 population. Other prognostic factors include acute respiratory failure or laboratory alterations as lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated inflammatory markers or acute kidney injury. 15, [20] [21] In our work we found age, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL at admission, LDH > 250 UI/L at admission and acute respiratory failure as independent predictors of mortality, but not atrial fibrillation. In this context, AF development could be only a marker of a higher risk population which is older and presents more comorbidities, but also a marker of a more aggressive SARS-CoV-2 infection clinical course with higher acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure or acute heart failure or myocarditis. It is known that AF is common in acute situations such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or infections where is associated with increased length of hospital admission and higher rates of complications and mortality. 24 Nonetheless, it is not the unique arrythmia in this context, where sinus tachycardia is the most common one even in the absence of fever. It has been described persistent sinus tachycardia after hospital discharge in approximately 40% survivors of SARS coronavirus disease. 37 We are aware of some limitations in our work. We only include hospitalized patients, so our conclusions cannot be assumed for outpatients. Echocardiogram was not included in the protocol and we only have information of a selected population with echo performed prior to admission. As already mentioned, it is possible that due to extremely high contagious rate of disease, electrocardiograms have been minimized to avoid contacts, conducting to a reduction in AF detection. We tried to use AliveCor Kardia monitor to improve arrythmia detection but continuous monitorization was not routinely performed in our centre, and to be honest, the retrospective character of our work prevented having the information. 25 It is probable that some patients could have developed asymptomatic paroxysmal AF, only detected with monitorization. In conclusion, atrial fibrillation appears in 10% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients present more comorbidities and a two-fold increase in hospital mortality. Atrial fibrillation is not an independent prognostic factor.
