Reviewer #1: Remarks to the Author: Wang and colleagues present two mAbs that (MW05 and MW07) have neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and does not cross-react with the S of SARS-CoV-1. Using an assay to measure ADE, they found that only MW05 can mediate internalization of pseudoparticles only in Raji cells and not in K562 or THP-1 cells. Further investigation find that FcgRIIB appears to be the determinant for Fc-Fc?R dependent internalization of Raji cells. Of note, there is some concern over Fc?R expression in THP-1 cells (discussed below). In vivo efficacy was validated in macaques where protection was found in both pre-and post-exposure prophylactic settings. A lot of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have already been published describing and the addition of two RBDspecific mAbs arguably adds little to the field. The idea of using cell lines to describe ADE is suggestive at best and may not reflect what may actually happen in nature. However, this should not be counted too much against the authors since the use of Raji cells have been used in CoV research. Of note, even in Raji cells SARS-CoV-1 replication was abortive (PMC3187504), meaning that while there is enhancement of entry, this mechanism did not lead to more viral progeny being made. This is in contrast to dengue virus, where it can replicate in Fc?R-bearing cells and thus enhance disease to due increase viral replication. The finding that Fc?RIIB mediated infection should be further discussed and authors should temper what this actually means in nature. In the dengue virus field, FcgRIIB has actually been demonstrated to inhibit ADE of infection (PMC3145677, PMC4673539). The strength of this paper is the finding that they have two mAbs that can differentially engage FcR and that protection was validated in non-human primates. Specifically, the authors should focus on why they have 2 mAbs that can or cannot engage FcRs -this can significantly educate this nascent field. We currently do not know what are the determinants of ADE in SARS-CoV-2. It would be highly encouraging if the epitopes can be elucidated of these two mAbs as they can provide some clues as to the structural basis of the ADE phenomenon.
The use of FcgRI is noted and is actually a creative way to quench the IgG mAbs -nicely done. However, why didn't the authors just use the LALA mutants to do the ADE assay? Line 95: It is interesting to observe that MW07 did not induce ADE, while MW05 did -especially since both appear to inhibit neutralization similarly. However, the significance of understanding the basis of determinants that affect ADE for this pandemic is paramount. It would be very beneficial for the field that the authors can identify the epitopes of both antibodies -through the generation of escape mutants. Figure 3C : Authors report that THP-1 cells do not express Fc?RIIb and does not support ADE of infection. However, prior work by Jaume et al., (PMC3187504) report that THP-1 cells are susceptible to ADE (to SARS-CoV-1) and do express Rc?RII. The authors should discuss this discrepancy. Reviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: The manuscript by Wang et al entitled "An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity eliminated neutralizing antibody with potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys" characterizes a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and its efficacy in challenged NHPs. Overall the paper is well organized and addresses the urgent need for medical countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro characterization of the antibodies was complete and explained well. The authors went as far as to address the antibody-dependent enhancement seen in the use of some antibody therapies. My main concern with the paper is the NHP efficacy study. Animals we treated with antibody 24 h before or 24 h after challenge constituting prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups. The authors suggest the antibody is protective based on n=3 NHPs clearance of virus RNA in oropharyngeal swab at day 4 and no viral RNA above the level of detection in the prophylactic group. The differences in histopathology are based on an n=1 at days 6 and 7 post-challenge. The authors should discuss the limitations of this study and how it relates to similar work from other groups. Specific concerns: Minor Line 77. The sentence "SARS-CoV-2 raced around the world after is initial outbreak." seems pedestrian and should be reworded using scientific terminology. Line 77-78. The sentence "Over the past few months it has been mutating." should be more specific. What part of the vial genome is mutating? Also this statement requires a citation. Line 127-128. The statement that viral titers decreased immediately after antibody administration requires more detail. When was the sample taken in regards to treatment (this should be stated in the materials and methods section)? How much was the decrease and was it statistically significant. Line 136-137 States the one NHP from each group was euthanized on days 6 and 7 post-challenge. What happened to the third NHP in each group? Lines 168 -169, Methods, first paragraph last sentence should be edited for grammar and content. Major Figure 4B and C. What is the limit of detection for the assay. It is probably the dotted line but this should be specified. Figure 4B . There should be some type of statistical analysis of this data. Line 127-128. The statement that viral titers decreased immediately after antibody administration requires more detail. When was the sample taken in regards to treatment (this should be stated in the materials and methods section)? How much was the decrease and was it statistically significant. Lines 148-146 State that SARS-CoV-2 protein only been detected in lung tissue of control group on 5 dpi but not on 6 dpi or 7 dpi. The data do not support this statement, there is no indication of animals being euthanized on 5 dpi. . Also, the authors should state the number of viral positive cells per field and the number of fields viewed. The number of fields viewed should be stated for all groups. Figure 4 E. State the day the samples were obtained. If this is Day 5, where is the other data from this day (viral load and histopathology)? Where is the nasal swab data? I am assuming they were all negative but that should be stated in the results section. The authors need to discuss why viral proteins were detected in the lungs but there was no genomic material detected. This seems counter intuitive has the PCR based assay should be more sensitive. The authors should discuss the limitations of the efficacy data, mainly the limited number of animals. Methods section, Animal experiments. The study design should be described in more detail including sampling times (swabs and blood collection) and euthanasia schedule. Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: The authors describe the preclinical development of a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody MW05, which was modified via a LALA mutation in the Fc portion to remove any ADE activity. They tested MW05/LALA both in a prophylactic as well as therapeutic setting in rhesus macaques. The authors provide interesting findings that are of high interest to the field. But I have a number of concerns, as expressed in my comments below, that need to be addressed. Major comments: • It is very surprising that the investigators, while able to find viral RNA in oropharyngeal swabs, and to a lesser extent rectal swabs, they were not able to find viral RNA in nasal swabs, although this is perhaps because they inoculated virus intratracheally. The researchers don't show any viral data on lower respiratory tract, such as bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal washes during the live phase of the study. Were such samples not collected, or did they not give the desired results? In addition, at time of necropsy, even the control animals had no detectable viral RNA in lung tissues by RT-PCR, which is surprising considering that there is much virus in the trachea and bronchi, and that there also still histopathology. What was the limit of detection for the tissue RT-PCR methodology, as that is not mentioned in the manuscript. • Figure 4 . Did the authors use a scoring system for the gross pathology and histopathology? From other studies, it is known that even in SARS-CoV-2 infected control animals, the lesions are often spotty, as many regions may still be normal. How detailed and how systematic was the analysis performed to assure that all groups are evaluated the same way and the comparison is valid. , so it should be updated. • As both MW05 and MW07 look promising in vitro, I am curious why the investigators selected MW05 for further development, especially as based on the in vitro data (Fig 3) , MW07 didn't have any detectable ADE effects. Can the authors mention the reason? • Line 118: Instead of "incubation", a better word would be "inoculation". • Line 124: the text says that the controls received antibody 1 day post-inoculation, but the legend of figure 4 mentions it was given 1 day before virus inoculation. Please verify and correct. • Line 140: The authors mention "cellulose". Do they mean a cellular reaction? • The histology pictures in Figure 4 are too low resolution to interpret. • Line 149 mentions detection of antigen in the lung tissue of the control group on day 5, but according to the rest of the manuscript, animals were euthanized either on day 6 or 7, so this is confusing. In Figure 4F , it is also not clear whether each panel presents the data on a single animal. • What strain of SARS-CoV-2 was used for the inoculation of the animals? • Line 284: Do body temperatures represent rectal temperatures, or was another method used? Wang and colleagues present two mAbs that (MW05 and MW07) have neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and does not cross-react with the S of SARS-CoV-1. Using an assay to measure ADE, they found that only MW05 can mediate internalization of pseudoparticles only in Raji cells and not in K562 or THP-1 cells. Further investigation find that FcgRIIB appears to be the determinant for Fc-FcrR dependent internalization of Raji cells. Of note, there is some concern over FcrR expression in THP-1 cells (discussed below). In vivo efficacy was validated in macaques where protection was found in both pre-and post-exposure prophylactic settings. A lot of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have already been published describing and the addition of two RBD-specific mAbs arguably adds little to the field. The idea of using cell lines to describe ADE is suggestive at best and may not reflect what may actually happen in nature. However, this should not be counted too much against the authors since the use of Raji cells have been used in CoV research.

The finding that FcrRIIB mediated infection should be further discussed and authors should temper what this actually means in nature. In the dengue virus field, FcgRIIB has actually been demonstrated to inhibit ADE of infection (PMC3145677, PMC4673539). The strength of this paper is the finding that they have two mAbs that can differentially engage FcR and that protection was validated in non-human primates.

We currently do not know what are the determinants of ADE in SARS-CoV-2. It would be highly encouraging if the epitopes can be elucidated of these two mAbs as they can provide some clues as to the structural basis of the ADE phenomenon. Line 70: Measuring RBD/ACE2 disrupting activities is not usually measured by a binding assay (ELISA), but rather through a neutralization assay, where the ability of an antibody to out compete for the viral receptor (ACE2) is measured. Please re-phrase the sentence. We appreciate the comments and suggestions of the reviewer. We agree that the neutralization assay is a better way to measure RBD/ACE2 disrupting activities of MW05 and MW07. The neutralization activities of MW05 and MW07 were measured in both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus systems (Fig. 2) . We also performed the disrupting assay for MW05 and MW07 using RBD recombinant protein and ACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells. Both MW05 and MW07 could effectively block the interaction of RBD with ACE2 (Fig. R1) . Line 88: It might be better if the neutralization data for the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 presented as endpoint titers as the way the assay was performed has a binary readout. Thanks for the suggestion. of FcgRI is noted and is actually a creative way to quench the IgG mAbs -nicely done. However, why didn't the authors just use the LALA mutants to do the ADE assay? Thanks for the reminding. We cited these two publications (ref : 18 and 19) . We conducted the ADE assay using LALA mutants. As shown in Fig. 3F , MW05/LALA totally abolished the ADE activity compared with wild-type MW05. Line 95: It is interesting to observe that MW07 did not induce ADE, while MW05 did -especially since both appear to inhibit neutralization similarly. However, the significance of understanding the basis of determinants that affect ADE for this pandemic is paramount. It would be very beneficial for the field that the authors can identify the epitopes of both antibodies -through the generation of escape mutants. This is an insightful suggestion. MW05 and MW07 showed similar binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 virus, but only MW05 enhanced the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to Raji cells. We generated several mutants to identified the epitope of these two mAbs. E484, Y489 and F490 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD are key amino acid residues contributing to MW05 binding (Fig.   R2A) . While, only Y489A mutation decreased the binding ability of MW07 (Fig.  R2B) . These results indicate that MW05 and MW07 recognize different epitopes. We believe that there is some correlation between MW05 recognized epitope and ADE activity. We agree with the reviewer. It would be very beneficial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of ADE activity on SARS-CoV-2 by identification of MW05 and MW07 recognized epitopes. We also appreciate the reviewer's suggestion by using escape mutation to identify the epitopes for MW05 and MW07. To explore the detailed epitope information, we generated SARS-CoV-2 RBD, MW05 Fab and MW07 Fab recombinant proteins (Fig. R3) . SARS-CoV-2 RBD and MW05 or MW07 Fab complexes were prepared for further crystal structure determination (Fig. R4) .  Thanks for the suggestion. In this paper (PMC3187504), Jaume and colleagues showed that THP-1 cells are susceptible to ADE for SARS-CoV-1. They also checked the expression profile of FcãRs using both RT-PCR and FACS assays. THP-1 cells only express RcãRIIA but not RcãRIIB (Fig. 5A, PMC3187504) . This result is in line with our data showing in Fig. 3C . THP-1 cells express RcãRIIA but not RcãRIIB (Fig.   3C ). The manuscript by Wang et al entitled "An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity eliminated neutralizing antibody with potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys" characterizes a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and its efficacy in challenged NHPs.

Specific concerns: Minor Line 77. The sentence "SARS-CoV-2 raced around the world after is initial outbreak." seems pedestrian and should be reworded using scientific terminology. We appreciate the comments and suggestions of the reviewer. We reworded the sentence: "After its initial outbreak, the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 has led to infections of millions of people and losses of many lives". (Line 77-78). Line 77-78. The sentence "Over the past few months it has been mutating." should be more specific. What part of the vial genome is mutating? Also this statement requires a citation. Thanks for the suggestion. We reworded the sentence to emphasize the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and added a citation (ref: 15). "Over the past few months, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been mutating" (Line 78-79). Line 127-128. The statement that viral titers decreased immediately after antibody administration requires more detail. When was the sample taken in regards to treatment (this should be stated in the materials and methods section)? How much was the decrease and was it statistically significant. Thanks for your advice. The information was added in the methods section. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 infection day was set as day 0. For the prophylactic group, the antibody was injected on day -1 (one day before SARS-CoV-2 infection), while for the therapeutic group, the antibody was given on day 1 (one day after SARS-CoV-2 infection) as indicated in the schematic bar. The swabs were collected from day 1 to day 7 post infection. In the therapeutic group, after antibody administration, viral titers decreased sharply compared with control group. In the control group, average viral titers at day 2, day 3 and day 4 are 10 6.1 copies/ml, 10 6.0 copies/ml and 10 6.7 copies/ml, respectively. While, in the therapeutic group, average titers at day 2, day 3 and day 4 are 10 4.0 copies/ml, 10 3.3 copies/ml and 10 2.5 copies/ml, respectively. As the group sizes (n=3) are small, even though viral RNA copies between control group and therapeutic (Post-challenge) group showed huge difference (100 to 10000 fold at different days), no significant difference was observed. Line 136-137 States the one NHP from each group was euthanized on days 6 and 7 post-challenge. What happened to the third NHP in each group? Animals were euthanized from each group on day 5, 6 and 7 post-challenge. We have added the animal data on day 5 in Fig. 4D and Fig. 4F . Lines 168 -169, Methods, first paragraph last sentence should be edited for grammar and content. We appreciate the reviewer's careful reading. The sentence was modified: "Informed consent was obtained from the COVID-19 patient before convalescent blood sample was collected." (Line 186-187) Major Figure 4B and C. What is the limit of detection for the assay. It is probably the dotted line but this should be specified. The dotted line represented the limit of detection which is 200 copies/ml. We added in the figure legend. Figure 4B . There should be some type of statistical analysis of this data. Thanks for the suggestion. As the group sizes (n=3) are small, we used "t test" to analysis the nasopharygeal swabs at different points. Even though viral RNA copies between control group and post-challenge (therapeutic) group have huge difference (100 to 10000 fold from day 2 to day 4) , no significant difference was observed.

Lines 148-146 State that SARS-CoV-2 protein only been detected in lung tissue of control group on 5 dpi but not on 6 dpi or 7 dpi. The data do not support this statement, there is no indication of animals being euthanized on 5 dpi. . Also, the authors should state the number of viral positive cells per field and the number of fields viewed. The number of fields viewed should be stated for all groups. Sorry for the confusing. We did have euthanized the NHPs on day 5 post infection and updated the data in Fig. 4 . About 10 positive cells in each field were observed and 5 fields were checked. We have added this information in figure legend.  Yes, it's the data for day 5. The NHPs were euthanized on day 5, 6 and 7 post infection. We have added the viral load and histopathology data on day 5 post infection in Fig. 4D and 4F .
