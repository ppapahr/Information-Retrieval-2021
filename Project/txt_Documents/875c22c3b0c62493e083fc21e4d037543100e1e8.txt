Background: SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus causing COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and 43
for taxonomic classification. Sequences with low identity (< 70%) to any reference 16S rRNA 143 gene or classified as eukaryotic were excluded from further analysis. We sought to determine how different samples were grouped according to their OTU 146 composition. To that end, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was 147 performed based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures were calculated among samples based 148 on relative OTU abundances (i.e. percentages) through the Vegan (v 2.5-6) package in R (v 149 3.6.3). The relative abundances of OTUs were also used to test for statistically significant 150 differences among severity groups. Group OTU compositions were compared through 151 ANOSIM. Next, Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) analysis was used to determine which OTUs 152 were responsible for driving the differences in community composition among groups. For 153 this analysis, all six possible pairwise combinations of severity groups were tested. 154 To infer associations between the severity of COVID-19 and the airways microbiome, general 156 linear models (GLM) were built using the R package MaAsLin2 with centred log-transformed 157 (CLR) OTUs counts as the dependent variable and the severity group (with group 0 and group 158 1 as references), adjusted by gender and age, as the independent variable. Only OTUs that 159 presented a prevalence of 20% over the sample space were considered. The resulting p-values 160 were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (BH).  Seventy-four patients were included in this pilot study to assess associations between the 173 nasopharyngeal microbiome composition and the severity of the COVID19 disease. However, 174 only 65 samples remained after quality coverage control (see Material and Methods). Data 175 including age, sex, diagnosis, hospital admission, and disease severity were registered (Table 176 S1). Sixteen patients belonged to the negative control (Group 0, no-SARS-CoV-2), whereas the 177 remaining patients were classified into three groups (Group 1, 2 and 3) according to the 178 severity (see methods). The average age of the patients was ca. 60 years old and around 49% 179 of them were diagnosed with pneumonia. 180 The bacterial phylum Firmicutes was the most abundant in the nasopharynx microbiome 182 among patients from all severity groups (52.94% ± 4.04%), followed by Bacteroidota (22.06% 183 ± 6.07%), Proteobacteria (12.75% ± 7.28%) and Actinobacteria (5.4% ± 0.6%). At the genus 184 level, Streptococcus was the most abundant taxon (25.23% ± 2.03%), followed by Prevotella 185 (16.20% ± 5.66%), Veillonella (14.45% ± 2.20%), Haemophilus (5.28% ± 4.76%) and Moraxella 186 (3.24% ± 3.6%) ( Figure S1 and Table S2 ). A total of 62 OTUs were found exclusively in SARS-187 CoV-2 positive patients (at a minimum of three samples). Most of these OTUs were classified 188 as members of the phylum Bacteroidetes (18) and Firmicutes (25) . Notably, the most common 189 genera among the OTUs found exclusively on COVID-19 positive patients were Prevotella (13), 190 followed by Leptotrichia (4) and Streptococcus (4). Samples were compared based on the 9 relative abundances of OTUs. This analysis revealed that samples did not cluster according to 192 the severity group neither by hierarchical clustering ( Figure S2A and 2B) or NMDS ( Figure S2C ). 193 Nevertheless, the differences in OTU composition among severity groups were significant 194 according to ANOSIM (R = 0.046, p = 0.036). 195 SIMPER analysis revealed that 25 OTUs were responsible for approximately 70% (p-value 196 0.04) of the differences in community composition between severity groups 1 and 3 ( Table  197 S3). These OTUs were classified as members of the phyla Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, 198  Using group 0 as a reference, we identified a total of 10 significant associations between 204 bacterial OTUs and patient severity (p-value < 0.05, q-value < 0.25), corrected for age and sex. 205 Among those, 9 were positively associated (8 in group 2 and 1 in group 3 when contrasted 206 with group 0) and 1 negatively associated (in group 3 contrasted with group 0) (Table S4 , 207 Figure 1A ). Of the OTUs positively associated with severity, 3 were classified as members of 208 the genus Prevotella (OTUs 4, 14 and 16). Due to the heterogeneity of group 0, we decided to 209 investigate also the differences within the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, using group 1 as 210 reference. The GLM model showed just 1 significant OTU (OTU 16), a Prevotella also found to 211 be significantly associated with severity in the first model (Table S4 , Figure 1B) . We did not 212 find any OTUs significantly different between groups 1 and 0. Figure 1A shows the coefficients 213 for all the significant OTUs found by both GLMs and figure 1B shows OTU 16 CLR transformed 214 counts for all severity groups. 215 In order to investigate how OTUs correlate in the different groups, we generated a total of 4 217 co-abundance networks, one for each severity group. For the severity group 0, the SARS-CoV- In this preliminary study, analysis of the taxonomic composition of the samples showed 232 differences between patients that developed different onsets of COVID-19. These changes in 233 nasopharyngeal community composition are subtle, meaning that they are restricted to few 234 taxa out of the complete meta-community. Nevertheless, there are detectable and significant 235 changes among OTU abundances. These changes could be linked to the different severity 236 groups, as we identified both taxa that were present exclusively among COVID-19 positive 237 patients as well as those whose abundance was significantly higher or lower among different 238 severity groups. Not only this, but also the complexity of co-abundance networks (which can 239 be taken as a proxy for potential interactions between taxa), was decreased among patients 240 that developed more severe cases of COVID-19. Below we discuss the mechanisms by which 241 specific microbes might play a role in either enhancing or decreasing the severity of COVID-242 19. Those results suggest potential biomarkers for the onset of the disease. 243 Among the OTUs positively associated with COVID-19 severity, three were classified as 245 members of the genus Prevotella, and one to a closely related genus, Alloprevotella. A recent 246 study showed that Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection through multiple 247 interactions with NF-êB signalling pathway, which is also involved in COVID-19 severity [19] . Corynebacterium directly connected to OTU16 (Prevotella sp.), but OTU 78, classified as 293 Corynebacterium is positively associated with OTU 96 (0.7479, p-value 0.001) in the co-294 abundance network from group 1 (Figure 3 ), indicating that in asymptomatic patients those 295 two taxa are forming a consortium that might protect from disease development. This 296 "consortium" was also implicated in resistance to recurrent ear infections and it was proposed 297 as a probiotic candidate for upper respiratory tract infections [40] . The reason that we did not 298 have lower q-value in our GLM for those two taxa could be the lack of power due to the small 299 size of our study. Thus, these associations warrant further investigation. 300 The major limitation of our study is the small sample size. With only about 15 samples per 303 severity group it is difficult to find statistically significant associations between microbiome 304 composition and disease severity. Nevertheless, this limitation is more likely to lead to false 305 negatives than to false positives. We also cannot rule out confounding factors that might 306 explain the differences between groups. Another important limitation is the fact that we 307 performed amplicon rather than whole genome shotgun sequencing. This leads to three 308 issues. First, some of the bacterial diversity is lost due to the fact that the selected primers do 309 not amplify the entirety of bacterial diversity. Second, some genomes have more than a single 310 copy of the 16S operon, which can lead to an overestimation of their abundance in the 311 samples. Third, without metagenomes (and metagenome assembled genomes) we could not 312 make inferences about the presence of virulence factors and other features of the genomes 313 of the microbes in our samples. We resorted to 16S amplification because our non-invasive 314 approach to collect samples yields low DNA amounts that are inadequate for sequencing. 315 However, as far as we know, this is a unique pilot study in the field. The aim is to be able to 316 transfer the first useful results to help clinical practice in the fight against the virus and to 317 optimize all the protocols and analyses for a second analysis in which the sample size will be 318 much larger. We are currently working on collecting more samples and optimizing protocols 319 that will allow us to obtain whole genome shotgun sequencing from them. 320 Our data provides preliminary evidence of significant differences in the composition of the 323 upper airway microbiome according to COVID-19 severity, suggesting potential biomarkers of 324 disease severity. While the richness indexes did not show significant differences among 325 groups, specific taxa were significantly associated with disease development. We also 326 demonstrated that the complexity of the co-abundance network is decreased in patients who 327 came to develop severe cases of the disease, indicating that the interactions between the 328 taxa are also relevant to this process. Further studies will be necessary to shed light on the 329 molecular mechanisms that give rise to these associations. Finally, we make no claim that the 330 differences in microbiome composition reported here are the cause of of COVID-19 severity. 331 Nevertheless, the significant associations found between these variables suggests that the 332 role of the microbiome on the onset of disease severity warrants further investigation.
