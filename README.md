<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was developed for the course of "Information Retrieval" in Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the University Of Ioannina under the supervision
of Professor Evaggelia Pitoura. The project is about the developement of a search engine specifically for COVID-19 realted documents, using the open-source library Lucene in java.

### Built With

This is the list of softwares and plugins that we are going to use in order to complete the project:
* [Oracle JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
* [Lucene 8.8.2](https://lucene.apache.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## About The Dataset
The dataset that was used was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">Kaggle</a> and consists of documents related to COVID-19. These documents are mainly scientific articles and research focused. All of them are in .json format, and more specifically they have been seperated into fields (inside the json file). In general each document has fields for a unique "paper-id", a title, a list of authors and a body-text that consists of paragraphs. Other fields inside the json format contain information such as references, citations, acknowledgements etc.   

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The useage of the program can be split in 4 broader sections that are explained in more detail below:

## General
blabla


## Text Analysis and Indexing
blabla

## Search
The search engine is based on keyword searching, where the user would query a word and the program would find said word on the database. Once the IndexWriter is done creating 
the index, we can use the IndexSearcher along with a Query (gotten from the user) to search for the desired results. This part will utilize embedding in order to make the search 
more efficient. The program is also able to search on a specific field of a document, whether it is the title of the document or the body, by changing the corresponding argument 
of the .searchIndex() command. One of the program's function is keeping the user's query history. This is useful to the user since it will show relevant keywords that other
users have searched for to his current query. 

## Result Presentation
The query's results will be presented on a list format, in which they will be listed based on their relevancy with the user's question. The user will be shown the top 10 
results, based on their relevancy, and will be able to see the next 10 results on the following page. The result itself will be a phrase of the document that includes the term
from the user's query, with the term highlighted for better visibility.  In addition to this, the user will be able to group up the results based on several criteria, 
such as the document's date of creation, the value of a specific field (title/body), the relevancy score of the document etc.
